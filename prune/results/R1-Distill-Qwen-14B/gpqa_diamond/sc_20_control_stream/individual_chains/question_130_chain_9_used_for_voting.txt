Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is about the redshift of objects detected using optical ground-based telescopes. The setup is that large clouds of neutral hydrogen are absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum because hydrogen emits or absorbs at that wavelength.

So the main point here is about redshift. Redshift happens when the wavelength of light is stretched because the source is moving away from us. For a quasar, if there's a cloud of hydrogen in front of it, the hydrogen will absorb some of the quasar's light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But because the cloud is moving (or because the universe is expanding), that absorption line will be shifted to a longer wavelength—redshifted.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because, well, Earth's atmosphere blocks a lot of UV, and ground-based telescopes don't go into space, so they can't see UV. So the absorption line must have been shifted into the optical range for it to be detectable.

Wait, let's clarify: the Lyman alpha line is originally at 1216 Angstroms, which is about 0.1216 micrometers, right? That's in the far ultraviolet. For an optical telescope to detect it, the redshifted wavelength must be in the optical range, say between 400 nm (violet) and 700 nm (red). So the redshifted wavelength (lambda_observed) must be greater than 400 nm. So we can set up an equation using redshift z.

The formula for redshift is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). So we have lambda_rest = 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm. Wait, no, wait: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Hmm, no wait, no—wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers? Let me double-check. Oh, no, wait: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers? Wait, 1 nanometer is 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, no, actually 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Right.

So the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, and the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range. Let's pick the lower end of optical, say 400 nm (which is 4000 Angstroms). But wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms? No, wait: 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength would be 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, no, wait a second. The visible spectrum for optical telescopes goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So if the observed wavelength is in that range, the redshift must shift 1216 Angstroms into that range.

So let's compute the redshift z. We can use lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). We need lambda_obs to be greater than 400 nm for optical.

Wait, converting units correctly. 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. To make it visible, the observed wavelength must be at least 400 nm. So:

lambda_obs >= 400 nm.

lambda_rest is 121.6 nm.

So z + 1 = lambda_obs / lambda_rest.

So z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1.

So the minimal lambda_obs is 400 nm.

So z >= (400 / 121.6) -1.

Let me compute that. 400 divided by 121.6 is approximately 3.292. So subtract 1, gives z >= 2.292.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the units. Oh wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, right. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no. Wait, no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So when you compute the ratio, 4000 / 1216 = approx 32.92/12.16 → Wait, let me compute.

Wait, no: 4000 divided by 1216. Let's calculate that.

Dividing 4000 by 1216:

1216 * 3 = 3648, 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 = 0.289 approx. So total is 3.289.

So z = 3.289 - 1 = 2.289. So z ≈ 2.29.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. Wait, 2.29 is just below 2.4. So the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just at 400 nm, which is the lower end of optical. So any higher z would shift it further into the optical.

But wait, wait. The question asks for the lower limit such that the object can be detected. So the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is still in the optical. So if z is too low, the observed wavelength would be in the ultraviolet, which optical telescopes can't see.

So the minimal z is when lambda_obs is 400 nm. That gives z ≈ 2.29. So the redshift must be at least 2.29 for the line to be in the optical.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is just above 2.29. D is 1.9, which is below. So if the redshift is 1.9, the observed wavelength would be 121.6*(1+1.9)=121.6 * 2.9 = 352.64 nm. That's in the ultraviolet, so optical telescopes wouldn't detect it. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is z >= 2.29. So the next higher option is C) 2.4.

But why is the question asking for the lower limit on the redshift? Because anything higher than that would be detectable, but lower wouldn't. So the lower limit is the minimal z where detection is possible.

Wait another thing, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversions. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. To reach 400 nm, which is in optical, the redshift is (400 / 121.6) -1 = 3.292 -1 = 2.292. So z = 2.292.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So any object with a redshift higher than that would have its Lyman alpha line in the optical range. So the lower limit is z ≥ 2.29. So the options are C)2.4, which is higher than this, and D)1.9, which is lower.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should check if the quasar's light is in the optical. Or is it the absorption line that's the issue?

Wait, the quasar emits light across a broad spectrum, including optical. But the Lyman alpha absorption is in the UV. So for a ground-based optical telescope, which can't see UV, they can't see the Lyman alpha line unless it's redshifted into the optical.

So the quasar's other light (visible) is what the optical telescope can see. But the absorption line is the key here. So if the Lyman alpha is shifted into the optical, then that absorption would be visible in the quasar's spectrum, allowing detection.

So the quasar must be at a redshift where its own emission is in the optical. Wait no, the quasar's emission is at higher redshifts, but for it to be detected, the quasar's rest-frame optical would be shifted into the observed optical. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the Lyman-alpha forest can be seen. The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in quasar spectra due to intervening neutral hydrogen clouds. These clouds have lower redshifts than the quasar. So for the absorption to be in the visible spectrum, the clouds must have a redshift such that the Lyman alpha line is in the visible.

Wait, but the quasar's redshift is higher than the clouds, right? Because the quasar is further away. So the cloud is between us and the quasar.

So the cloud's redshift z_cloud is less than the quasar's redshift z_quasar. Wait, no, higher redshift means further away. So if the cloud is in front, between us and the quasar, then the quasar is at a higher redshift. The cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's.

Wait, no. Wait, the quasar is at a higher redshift (more distant), so the cloud is at a lower redshift. So the cloud's Lyman alpha line is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Therefore, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption would be longer than the quasar's rest wavelength?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The quasar emits light across the spectrum, including the Lyman alpha wavelength. But if there's a cloud in front, it'll absorb at Lyman alpha. But for us to see that absorption line in the quasar's spectrum, it must be in the observed optical range.

So the absorption line's wavelength is redshifted from 1216 A (121.6 nm) to some longer wavelength. For it to be in the visible, that wavelength needs to be between 400 nm and 700 nm.

So the minimal z is when 121.6*(1+z) = 400 nm.

Wait, no, wait 121.6 nm is 1216 Angstroms. So 121.6 nm is 0.1216 micrometers.

Wait, no, 400 nm is 0.4 micrometers. So the observed wavelength is (1+z) times the rest wavelength.

So (1 + z) = 400 / 121.6 → 3.292 → z=2.292.

So the minimal z is around 2.29.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is just above 2.29. So the correct answer would be C) 2.4 as the lower limit. Because any lower than that would have the line in the ultraviolet, which optical telescopes can't see. So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29, so the lower limit is just above that, making option C the correct choice.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the object. So the object here is the cloud. So the cloud must have a redshift high enough that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical. So the lower limit is z_cloud >= 2.29.

So the correct answer would be the minimal z where the line is in optical, which is about 2.29. So of the options, the closest higher number is 2.4 (option C). Alternatively, if the question allows for the line to be at the edge of optical, perhaps 400 nm is considered the lower edge. So if the cloud's redshift is higher than 2.29, then the line is in the optical, detectable. So the lower limit is z =2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C)2.4. So the answer is C.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption line at 1216 Å (121.6 nm) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to calculate the redshift \( z \) that shifts the absorption line into the visible spectrum (approximately 400–700 nm). 

The relationship between the observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) and the rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Rearranging for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 400 \, \text{nm} \) (the lower limit of the optical range):

\[
z = \frac{400}{121.6} - 1 \approx 3.292 - 1 = 2.292
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift required for the Lyman-alpha line to be detectable in the optical range is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \). Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated value and represents an upper bound, not the lower limit.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than the calculated value and would result in the absorption line remaining in the ultraviolet, undetectable by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is just above the calculated value of 2.29 and represents the lower limit where the absorption line enters the optical range.
- **D) 1.9**: This is below the calculated value and would place the absorption line in the ultraviolet, making it undetectable by optical telescopes.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 2.4**, as it represents the lower limit on the redshift where the Lyman-alpha line is redshifted into the optical range and detectable by ground-based telescopes.
