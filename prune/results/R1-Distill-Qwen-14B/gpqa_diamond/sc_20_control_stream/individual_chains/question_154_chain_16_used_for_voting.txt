Okay, so I have this problem where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and I need to figure out which compound it is using the spectral data provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures. Let me start by going through each piece of data step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes give clues about the molecular formula. The molecular weight here is 156 g/mol. The peak at 158 is about 32%, which is noticeable but not the highest. That might indicate a fragment or an isotope peak. Wait, chloro compounds have isotopes. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance for the M+2 peak. So for a molecule with one Cl, the M+2 would be around 35Cl and 37Cl, so about 75% abundance (since Cl is about 75% for M+2). But wait, the 158 is only 32% of the 156 peak. Hmm, maybe it's not Cl? Or maybe there's more than one Cl? Or perhaps another isotope effect. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with Cl.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid (which would be broad) or an alcohol. But wait, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. Carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 1700, but maybe it's an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. Wait, but an aldehyde has a peak around 2800 cm^-1 for the C-H stretch too. But the IR here shows a broad peak in that region, which makes me think it's more likely an -OH, like a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's either a benzoic acid derivative. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. The IR would have the aldehyde peak at around 2800 (stretch), but I don't see that in the data. The broad peak from 3500 could be from the OH. Also, the carbonyl from the aldehyde would be around 1700, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which might match. But wait, the 1H NMR would have an aldehyde proton, which is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But looking at the NMR data, there's a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is higher than aldehyde. Oh wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. So maybe this isn't an aldehyde.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: That's a benzoic acid with Cl in the para position. The IR would show a broad -OH (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl around 1700. The 1720 is a bit higher, but maybe it's just the exact value depending on substitution. The NMR would have a singlet around 11 ppm for the COOH proton, which matches the data. Looking at the NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) could be the COOH proton. Then, the aromatic protons: in benzoic acid, the two H next to COOH (ortho and para) would be deshielded. Wait, wait, benzoic acid has three sets of aromatic protons: the ortho, meta, and para to the COOH group. But in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents would be Cl and COOH in para positions. Wait, no, wait: 4-chlorobenzoic acid has COOH in position 1, Cl in position 4. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. So the H at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be deshielded. Wait, the NMR shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests two sets of two protons each, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene. Wait, but benzoic acid has a COOH group at a position; the aromatic protons would be in a pattern. Let me think about the substitution.

Wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is where the COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 4. So the benzene ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. The aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. The H at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and para to Cl. The H at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the protons are in a para-substituted pattern. Wait, let me think of the NMR.

The NMR shows 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each with two protons each. For example, a substituent at position 2 and 6 (ortho positions) relative to each other. Or perhaps a substituent in position 4 and another in a way that creates a d,d pattern.

Wait, considering benzoic acid derivatives. Benzoic acid itself has a singlet for the COOH proton (but I think it's more of a broad peak, but maybe in D2O, it's exchanged and doesn't show up? Wait, no. If it's a solid, maybe the COOH is deprotonated? Wait, wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is typically around 10-12 as a singlet. But if the compound is solid, maybe it's not fully dissolved, and the solution is not D2O. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoic acid with other substituents.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the chloroformate group is OCOCl attached to benzene. Wait, the structure is actually Cl-CO-O-Ph. The molecular formula for phenyl chloroformate is C6H5COOCl: molecular weight would be (6*12 +5*1) + (12 + 16*2 + 35.5) = 77 + (12 +32 +35.5) = 77 + 79.5 = 156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156. So maybe that's a match. Wait, 156.5 is close to 156, but molecular weight would be 156.5, so the molecular ion would be around 156.5, but the given is 156. Maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recheck: C6H5 is 77. COOCl is (12 + 16*2 +35.5) = 12 +32 +35.5 = 79.5. 77 +79.5=156.5. So the molecular weight is 156.5, but the mass spec is at 156. So that suggests perhaps the molecular ion is at m/z 156, but the exact mass would be 156.5. Maybe the issue is that the molecular ion is observed at 156, but perhaps it's M+ (without considering the 0.5). Alternatively, maybe it's not the molecular ion but a fragment.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156 with 100% intensity. So perhaps the actual formula is different. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32 = 156.5. So same as phenyl chloroformate. But the molecular ion is at 156, but the exact mass is 156.5, so perhaps it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is observed as M+1? Or perhaps another isotope is abundant.

Wait, the mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z 158 (32%). For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the M is 156.5. So M+1 would be 157.5, but the 158 is 1.5 higher than M. Hmm, maybe that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the 158 is M+ something else.

Alternatively, option C: phenyl chloroformate. Molecular weight 156.5. So M is 156.5. So the M peak would be at 156 (rounded down). But then M+2 would be 158. Wait, because Cl has isotopes. Cl is about 35 (~75%) and 37 (~25%). So for a molecule with one Cl, the M would be 35Cl-based (m/z 156.5), and M+2 would be 37Cl, so 158.5 (but I think the exact mass is 158.5, but the mass spec shows 158). The percentage for M+2 in Cl-containing compounds is about 25% of base peak (since Cl is about 25% 37Cl). So if the base peak is at 156 (100%), the M+2 would be at 158, with 25% intensity. But the data shows 32% at 158. That's a bit higher than 25%, so maybe there's another Cl? Or perhaps it's a different element. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, if the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), then the M+2 is 158. For a molecule with one Cl, the abundance would be (35Cl is 75%, 37Cl is 25%). So the M peak is 156 (35Cl), M+2 is 158 (37Cl). So the intensity ratio is 75% for M and 25% for M+2. But the data shows M:100%, M+2:32%. Hmm, that's higher than the 25% expected. That suggests maybe there's another Cl, or perhaps the molecular formula has a Cl and another element with a higher isotope abundance. Alternatively, perhaps it's not Cl? Wait, but the options include Cl.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is C with two Cls. Then, the M would be 156, and M+2 would be 158. Let's see: if there are two Cls, the M would be 35Cl2 (75% * 75% = 56.25% of M), and M+2 would be 35Cl37Cl (75% *25% + 25% *75%) = 37.5% of M. So the M+2 would be 37.5% of M. But the data shows 32% at M+2. Hmm, not a perfect match, but closer than one Cl. So maybe the compound has two Cls, but looking at the options, none of the options have two Cls.

Wait, the options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: formula is C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is 12*7 +5 +35.5 +16*2 = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: same formula as A, I think. Wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2. So same as A. So molecular weight 156.5.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: C6H5COOCl, which is C8H5ClO2. So molecular weight is 8*12=96, 5H=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 96+5+35.5+32=168.5? Wait, no, wait. C6H5 is 77, COOCl is (12)+(16*2) +35.5 = 12+32+35.5=79.5. 77+79.5=156.5. So same as options A and B.

Wait, all three options (A, B, C) have molecular weight 156.5. So the mass spec shows molecular ion at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). How does that fit?

Wait, if the molecular ion is 156.5 (which is ~156 in integer terms), the M+2 would be 158.5 (37Cl in COOCl). So in phenyl chloroformate (option C), the M is 156.5, and M+2 is 158.5. The intensity of M+2 would be about 25% (since Cl is 25% 37Cl). But the data has 32% at 158, which is 158. So maybe it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the [M]+ but a fragment. Hmm, but the problem states it's the molecular ion peak.

Wait, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156 and the peak at 158 is due to another fragment. So perhaps the molecule has a Cl, which would mean that the M+2 is 158, and 25% of the M peak would be 158. But in the data, it's 32% at 158. So that's higher than 25%. Could another factor be at play, like another isotope or a double bond leading to a different splitting?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2. Let me compute that: 8*12=96, 7*1=7, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 96+7+35.5+32=169.5, which is higher than 156. So no.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something else. Let me think about the other data.

IR: strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl. Carboxylic acid is around 1700, maybe a bit higher if deprotonated. An ester is around 1740-1720. A ketone is around 1715. An aldehyde is around 2800 (stretch) and 1720 maybe. Wait, but an aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720. However, the IR also shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is likely an -OH (as aldehyde protons are sharp). But I thought earlier that the singlet at 11 ppm in NMR could be a COOH proton.

Wait, let's think about the IR. The broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is a wide range. That might suggest an -OH group. But 2700 is also where aldehyde C-H stretches appear. So perhaps that's an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol or a phenol.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with a Cl and OH groups. So the IR would show the aldehyde peak around 1720, and the OH (from the alcohol) as a broad peak. The aldehyde C-H stretch would be around 2820 and 2720, but the IR says 3500-2700, so that might include those. But why is the peak at 1720? That could match the aldehyde.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The IR would show a broad -OH (from COOH) and a strong carbonyl (COOH, around 1700, but maybe higher). The NMR would have a singlet around 11 ppm, which fits the data.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's a chloroformate ester. The IR would have a carbonyl from the ester, around 1720. The Cl would be present, but where's the -OH? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. It doesn't have an -OH group, unless it's a different structure. Wait, no, it's OCOCl attached to benzene. So no -OH group. So the IR's broad peak might not come from an -OH.

Hmm, that's a problem. If the compound is phenyl chloroformate, then where does the broad peak from 3500-2700 come from? There's no hydroxyl group. So that might rule out option C.

So if the IR shows a broad peak, suggesting an -OH, then options A and B might be more likely. Because option C doesn't have an -OH.

Now looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H) → likely a COOH proton (as that's around 10-12 ppm as a singlet), or possibly an aldehyde proton.

8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H) → each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets, each with 2H, likely from adjacent protons on a para-substituted ring.

So, for a para-substituted benzene, the two substituents would be in the 1 and 3 positions? Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, substituents are in positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4, making the remaining protons in positions 2,3,5,6. But for a para-substituted di-substituted benzene, the coupling would lead to two doublets each integrating to 2H. So for example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then, the ring has H's at 2,3,5,6.

In that case, the H at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH and meta to Cl) would be deshielded and appear as a doublet, and H at 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl) would be a different doublet. Wait, but in that case, the H's would be in two sets of two, each as doublets.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the substituents are in positions 1 and 2, making the ring protons 3 and 6 as one doublet, and 4 and 5 as another. But that would require a meta substitution, but the NMR shows two doublets, each for 2H, which is more typical of a para-disubstituted benzene.

So, considering 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The H's at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

Wait, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH are more deshielded (downfield) than those meta. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and would be more downfield than H's at 3 and 5. So in the NMR, the H's at 2 and 6 would be a doublet around 8 ppm, and H's at 3 and 5 would be a doublet around 7.7 ppm. Which matches the NMR data given: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that fits.

So, putting it together:

- Mass: M=156.5, but observed at 156. M+2 at 158, which is 32%. Since the molecule has one Cl, the M+2 would be 37Cl, giving a peak at 158.5, but the data shows 158, which is close. The abundance should be ~25%, but the data shows 32%. Maybe an error or perhaps another factor, but it's close enough.

- IR: Broad peak from 3500-2700 suggests -OH (from COOH), and 1720 cm^-1 for COOH carbonyl.

- NMR: Singlet at 11 ppm (COOH proton), and two doublets for aromatic protons, which fit the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. 

Alternatively, let's check option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would have COOH at position 1 and Cl at 2. The ring protons would be at 3,4,5,6. So the H at 4 and 6 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. H at 3 and 5 would be meta to Cl and ortho to COOH. The coupling would be similar, but the chemical shifts would be different. In this case, the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 6?) Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong. Alternatively, the NMR would have different chemical shifts. I think for 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be different.

Wait, no. If COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 2, then the H at position 2 is Cl, so H's at 3,4,5,6. Let me think: the H at 3 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. H at 4 would be para to COOH and meta to Cl. H at 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. H at 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. So, the H's at 3 and 5 would be similar, and H's at 4 and 6 would be similar. Would their shifts match the given data?

In the given data, the H's are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (position 6) would be more deshielded (downfield) than those meta. So their shifts would be higher. But I'm not certain. Maybe option B's shifts fit better.

Another point: the 1720 cm^-1 in IR. Benzoic acids typically have lower carbonyl peaks. Wait, benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700. If it's higher, like 1720, perhaps it's an ester or an acid chloride. But if the compound is a benzoic acid, maybe the substituents are electron-withdrawing, making the carbonyl peak higher. Chlorine is an EWG, so 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have a higher carbonyl shift than benzoic acid. So 1720 is plausible.

Option C, phenyl chloroformate: it's an ester, so the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches. But earlier, the IR broad peak suggests an -OH, which it doesn't have. So option C is likely excluded.

So, putting it all together, option B seems the best fit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the compound, the provided spectral data was analyzed systematically:

### Mass Spectrometry:
- The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156** (100%), and a peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) is observed.  
- The molecular weight of 156 aligns with the formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**, which corresponds to a molecular weight of **156.5**.  
- The peak at **m/z = 158** suggests the presence of chlorine, as chlorine isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) contribute to the M+2 peak. The abundance of 32% is slightly higher than the expected 25% for ³⁷Cl, but it is close enough to suggest a single chlorine atom in the molecule.

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:
- A **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.  
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl group. This is consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester.  

### Proton NMR:
- A **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)** is characteristic of the acidic proton in a carboxylic acid group.  
- Two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, as the protons are split into two sets of two equivalent protons each.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains an aldehyde group, which would show a characteristic C-H stretch around 2800 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum. However, the IR data does not indicate this, and the singlet at 11.0 ppm in the NMR is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton than an aldehyde proton.  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
   - The molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂** matches the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**.  
   - The IR spectrum is consistent with a carboxylic acid, as it shows a broad -OH peak and a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The NMR data fits the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm match the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl).  
   - **Matches all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**  
   - The molecular formula **C₈H₅ClO₂** corresponds to a molecular weight of 156.5, but the structure lacks an -OH group. The broad peak in the IR spectrum between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ cannot be explained by this compound.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
   - While this compound has a similar molecular formula to 4-chlorobenzoic acid, its NMR data would not match the given spectrum. The aromatic protons in 2-chlorobenzoic acid would not produce two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm due to the different substitution pattern.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data is most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.  

**Answer: B**
