Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. They also mention that when measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but the given expression doesn't seem to account for that. Hmm, maybe the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the problem gives the part where it's non-zero.

I think the key here is normalization of the wave function. Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So, the probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

The wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me write it down. ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 + x)) - (0.5)i. So, it's a complex function. The modulus squared would be |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, since the imaginary part is 0.5i. Because when you take the modulus squared, you add the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be square-integrable and normalized. So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 should be 1.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So, ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1 + x))] + (-0.5)i. When we compute the modulus squared, it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

So, the integral from x = 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but the question says that the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So, outside that range, the wave function is zero. Therefore, the integral from 1 to 3 is the only part contributing.

So, set up the integral:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral term by term. Split it into two parts: the first term is a²/(1+x), and the second term is 0.25.

Integrating a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. Let u = 1+x, du = dx. So the integral becomes a² ∫ (1/u) du from u=2 to u=4.

Which is a² [ln(u)] from 2 to 4 = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln2.

The second part is integrating 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln2 = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln2.

What's ln2 approximately? I think ln2 is about 0.6931.

So, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, the options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

So 0.849 is approximately 0.85. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the wave function? Because in the given wave function, it's [a / sqrt(1 + x)] minus 0.5i. So when I compute the modulus squared, it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Hmm, correct.

Wait, but another thought: the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Does this imply that the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5? That would make |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

So, with the integral giving a^2 ln2 + 0.5 =1.

So, a^2 = 0.5 / ln2 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the integral. The first part is a² times integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Yes, so a² * 0.6931 + 0.5 =1.

So, a² = (0.5)/0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213)≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \):  
   Let \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \). The limits change from \( x=1 \) (\( u=2 \)) to \( x=3 \) (\( u=4 \)).  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 (\ln 4 - \ln 2) = a^2 \ln 2
   \]

2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \):  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln 2 + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln 2}
\]

Using \( \ln 2 \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Integrating a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. Let u = 1+x, du = dx. So the integral becomes a² ∫ (1/u) du from u=2 to u=4.

Which is a² [ln(u)] from 2 to 4 = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln2.

The second part is integrating 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln2 = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln2.

What's ln2 approximately? I think ln2 is about 0.6931.

So, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, the options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

So 0.849 is approximately 0.85. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the wave function? Because in the given wave function, it's [a / sqrt(1 + x)] minus 0.5i. So when I compute the modulus squared, it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Hmm, correct.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

So, with the integral giving a^2 ln2 + 0.5 =1.

So, a^2 = 0.5 / ln2 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the integral. The first part is a² times integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Yes, so a² * 0.6931 + 0.5 =1.

So, a² = (0.5)/0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213)≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function:

\[

\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

   Let \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \). The limits change from \( x=1 \) (\( u=2 \)) to \( x=3 \) (\( u=4 \)).  
   \[

   \]

2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \):  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln 2 + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln 2}
\]

Using \( \ln 2 \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
