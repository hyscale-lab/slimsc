Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me remember what I know about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. From my notes, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of partial waves, each with their own phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over these partial waves. Oh right, the general expression is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cos θ), where δ_l is the phase shift for each angular momentum l, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. Oh right, along the beam means θ = 0 degrees. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0).

Let me think about how to compute f(0). The formula at θ=0 would involve each term's contribution when θ is zero. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l, since P_l(1) = 1. So each term simplifies to (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. So the amplitude at θ=0 is (1/k) times the sum from l=0 to ... (but we are ignoring higher phase shifts beyond l=4 as per the problem statement).

So f(0) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. But wait, the problem gives δ_o=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13. So l=0 to 4. 

Wait, let me clarify what each δ represents. δ_0 is the l=0 phase shift, δ_1 is l=1, etc. So yes, for each l, I need to compute (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

But wait, the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term multiplied by 1/k. Because each term is a complex number, and when I sum all the terms, their imaginary parts add up.

So, let me compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.

The imaginary part of e^{iδ} is sinδ, so for each term (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(δ_l) * sin(δ_l), because e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ, so multiplying by sinδ gives (2l+1) [sinδ * (sinδ + i cosδ)]. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. Let's write e^{iδ} as cosδ + i sinδ. So the term becomes (2l+1)(cosδ + i sinδ) sinδ. Expanding that, it's (2l+1)(cosδ sinδ + i sin²δ). 

So the imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So the total imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Wait, that makes sense. So the imaginary part Im[f(0)] is (1/k) multiplied by the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

So, I need to compute each (2l+1) * sin^2(δ_l), sum them up, and then multiply by 1/k.

But wait, what is k? k is the wave number. And since the electrons are in a nuclear target, I think we should use the relation that k is related to the momentum of the electron.

Wait, the electrons are 50 MeV. So to find k, I need to compute the momentum of the electron. The energy is given as 50 MeV. So the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, but I think for a non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), where m is the electron mass. But wait, 50 MeV is a significant fraction of the electron rest mass (which is about 0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects might be important. Hmm, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, but nothing about relativistic effects, so maybe I can approximate using non-relativistic formulas.

Wait, but 50 MeV is 50 million eV, which is 5e7 eV. The rest mass is 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is about 98 times the rest mass. So definitely relativistic. So perhaps I should compute the relativistic momentum.

The total energy E of the electron is given by the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Wait, but in high-energy physics, the electron's total energy is much bigger than its rest mass. So E ≈ pc, because for relativistic particles, E ≈ pc.

Wait, but wait. The kinetic energy K is given as 50 MeV. The total energy E is then K + mc². So E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV. But since 50 is much larger, perhaps E ≈ 50 MeV. So E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/c. Wait, but let's think about units.

I'm a bit confused about energy, momentum, and mass. Let me write the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

Given that E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV. So E ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So, (pc c)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2.

Wait, no: (pc)^2 = (E)^2 - (mc²)^2.

Wait, E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So, solving for pc: pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2).

So, let's compute that. E = 50.511 MeV, mc² = 0.511 MeV.

E² = (50.511)^2 ≈ (50.5)^2 = 2550.25 (MeV)^2.

(mc²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = 2550.25 - 0.261 ≈ 2549.99 (MeV)^2.

So pc ≈ sqrt(2549.99) ≈ 50.497 MeV. So p ≈ 50.497 MeV / c.

But wait, momentum p has units of MeV/c. So k is the wave number, which is p/ħ.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But since we're dealing with energies in MeV and c in terms of these units, perhaps I can express k in terms of inverse fermi (fm^-1), since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between k and p. Since k = p/ħ.

But to compute k in atomic units or in appropriate units, let's think about the formula.

Wait, another approach: the wave number k is given by k = (p)/ħ. So, once I have p in units of MeV/c, I can convert p to kg·m/s, then divide by ħ to get k in m^-1.

But that might involve a lot of unit conversions. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to calculate k in terms of MeV and known constants.

Wait, I know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So that's a useful constant.

So, if p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm, then p (MeV/c) multiplied by ħ c gives p * ħ c = (MeV/c) * MeV·fm = (MeV^2·fm) / c. Wait, not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, since p = E/c (for relativistic particles where E ≈ pc), and ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so k = p/ħ = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c) * (1/c) *c? Wait, perhaps let me compute it step by step.

Wait, p = E/(c) because for relativistic particles, E ≈ pc.

So p = 50.511 MeV/c.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50.511 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

So, substituting, k = (50.511 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV·fm) / c ) ].

The c's cancel out, and MeV units cancel. So,

k = 50.511 / 197.33 fm^-1.

Calculating that: 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm^-1.

Wait, 50.511 divided by 197.33 is approximately what? Let me compute 197.33 *0.25=49.3325. So 0.25 gives about 49.33. The numerator is 50.511, which is a bit more. So 0.256? Let's compute 197.33 *0.256:

0.25 *197.33 =49.3325

0.006 *197.33=1.184

So 49.3325 +1.184=50.5165. Wait, that's very close to 50.511. So 0.256 gives about 50.5165, which is a tiny bit more than 50.511. So perhaps 0.256 minus a fraction. Let's compute 0.256 *197.33.

197.33 *0.256: 197.33 *0.2=39.466, 0.05=9.8665, 0.006=1.18398. So 39.466 +9.8665=49.3325, plus 1.18398=50.5165. So 197.33 *0.256=50.5165. So 50.511/197.33 = approximately 0.256 - (50.5165-50.511)/(197.33). The difference is 0.0055. So 0.0055/197.33≈ 0.000028. So 0.256 - 0.000028 ≈ 0.255972.

So k≈0.256 fm^-1.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 50.511 /197.33.

Wait, 197.33 *0.256=50.5165 as before.

So 50.511 is 0.0055 less than 50.5165. So 0.0055/197.33 ≈ 2.786e-5.

So 50.511/197.33 ≈ 0.256 - 2.786e-5 ≈ 0.255972 (approx 0.25597).

So k ≈0.25597 fm^-1. I'll keep a few more decimal places for accuracy, but perhaps I can use k≈0.256 fm^-1 for calculation purposes.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me try 50.511 divided by 197.33.

Let me compute 197.33 * x =50.511.

So x=50.511/197.33 ≈ 0.25597.

So k≈0.25597 fm^-1.

Now, moving on. So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) multiplied by the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin²(δ_l).

So let's compute each term (2l+1)*sin²(δ_l):

For l=0: (2*0+1)=1. δ_0=90 degrees. sin(90)=1. So 1 *1^2=1.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ_1=67 degrees. Sin(67) is approximately 0.9205. So 3*(0.9205)^2 =3*(0.8473)=2.5418.

l=2: (5) * sin²(55). Sin(55)≈0.8192. (0.8192)^2≈0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3: (7)* sin²(30). Sin(30)=0.5. So 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: (9) * sin²(13). Sin(13)≈0.22495. Squared is about 0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Now, summing all these up:

l=0: 1.0

l=1: 2.5418 → total so far 3.5418

l=2: 3.355 → total 6.8968

l=3: 1.75 → total 8.6468

l=4: 0.4554 → total 9.1022.

So sum =9.1022.

So the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum → (1/0.25597 fm^-1) * 9.1022.

Wait, 1/k is (1 /0.25597 fm^-1) ) = 3.907 fm.

So 3.907 fm *9.1022 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.907 *9.1022.

3 *9=27.

0.907 *9=8.163.

3.907 *0.1022≈0.3994.

So total approximates to 27 +8.163=35.163 +0.3994≈35.562.

Wait, but that's a rough calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

3.907 *9.1022.

= 3.907 *9 + 3.907 *0.1022.

3.907 *9=35.163.

3.907 *0.1022= approx 3.907 *0.1=0.3907, plus 3.907 *0.0022≈0.008595. So total 0.3907 +0.008595≈0.3993.

So 35.163+0.3993=35.5623 fm.

So approximately 35.562 fm. Looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Option C is about 177.675, which is roughly half of B. Option D is 251, which is about 2/3 of B.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because the result I'm getting is about 35.56 fm, but the options are much larger. Let me see.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check the calculation of k.

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated k. Because when I calculated p = E/c, but E is 50.511 MeV, but p is in units of MeV/c. Then, when calculating k = p / ħ, perhaps I should use the correct units for ħ.

Wait, more accurately, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c^2? No, wait. Let me think again. The speed of light c is in m/s. So perhaps I should think in terms where c is 1, but in appropriate units.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute k in terms of inverse meters, but then convert to inverse femtometers.

Wait, let's compute k more accurately.

Given that k = p/(ħ).

But p is 50.511 MeV/c.

So, I need to express p in kg·m/s, then divide by ħ (in J·s) to get k in m^-1.

Let's see:

1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J.

So p = 50.511 MeV/c = (50.511e6 * 1.60218e-13 J) / (2.998e8 m/s).

Wait, wait, calculation:

p = (50.511e6 eV) * (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ) / (2.998e8 m/s).

Because 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

So:

p = (50.511e6 * 1.60218e-19) / 2.998e8

Compute numerator: 50.511e6 *1.60218e-19 = 50.511 * 1.60218e-13 = approx 50.511 *1.60218e-13 = ?

50 *1.60218e-13 = 8.0109e-12.

0.511 *1.60218e-13 = approx 8.18e-14.

Total = 8.0109e-12 + 8.18e-14 ≈ 8.0927e-12 kg·m/s.

Divide by 2.998e8 m/s.

p = (8.0927e-12) / (2.998e8) ≈ 2.70e-20 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = p / ħ = (2.70e-20) / (1.0545718e-34) ) ≈ 2.56e14 m^-1.

Wait, m^-1 is inverse meters. To convert to inverse femtometers (fm^-1), since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so 1 m = 1e15 fm.

So 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

Wait, no. Because 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So k in fm^-1 is (2.56e14 m^-1) * (1e15 fm/m) )^-1 → wait, let's think again.

Wait, 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 → 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So k = 2.56e14 m^-1 → in fm^-1, it's 2.56e14 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.56e-1 fm^-1 = 0.256 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.256 fm^-1, which matches the previous calculation.

So the earlier value of k is correct.

So, the sum S is 9.1022, so (1/k) * S = (1/0.256) * 9.1022 = 3.90625 *9.1022 ≈ 35.56 fm.

So the imaginary part is approximately 35.56 fm. But looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait a minute! Did I miscalculate the sum? Let me recheck the sum.

Sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1)* sin²δ_l.

l=0: 1 * sin²(90) →1*1=1 → sum=1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67). Sin(67)=approx 0.9205 → 0.9205²= approx 0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419 → sum=3.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²(55). Sin(55)=approx 0.8192 → 0.6710. 5 *0.6710=3.355 → sum=6.8969.

l=3:7 * sin²(30). Sin(30)=0.5 → 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75 → sum=8.6469.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)=approx 0.22495 → 0.0506. 9 *0.0506=0.4554 → sum=9.1023.

So sum S is approx 9.1023.

So (1/k)*S = (1/0.256) *9.1023 ≈ 3.90625 *9.1023 = approx 35.56 fm.

But none of the options match this. The closest option is B) 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I see the mistake. Oh wait! Because when calculating k, I used p as the momentum, which is correct, but when determining E, I think I may have missed including the rest mass properly. Wait, the given energy is 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. So the total energy E is K + m c².

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I used E = 50.511 MeV, which is correct. But when I compute p, perhaps I should use E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So p = sqrt( E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c.

So let me recompute p correctly.

E =50.511 MeV.

mc² =0.511 MeV.

E² = (50.511)^2 = 2551.31 MeV².

(mc²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.2611 MeV².

So (pc)^2 = 2551.31 -0.2611 ≈2551.05 MeV².

So pc = sqrt(2551.05) ≈50.509 MeV.

So p = (50.509 MeV) / c.

So, now, to compute p in kg·m/s, I need to convert 50.509 MeV/c into SI units.

Wait, another approach: since we have ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm, and p = E/c for E >> mc².

Wait, perhaps I can compute k using the correct formula.

k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c).

But E is 50.511 MeV, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = (50.511 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → which is 50.511 /197.33 fm^-1.

Which, as before, is approximately 0.25597 fm^-1.

So that part is correct. So why is the sum leading to 35.56 fm, but the options are much larger?

Wait a minute! Wait, perhaps I have mixed up the formula. The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (since it's a measure of cross-section times solid angle). Wait, but cross-section σ is |f|^2 * (4π/k²) or something like that, but the amplitude f itself is dimensionless? No, wait, no, I think f has units of length, because cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by some factors, but I might be getting confused.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is in units of length (fm, for example). Because the differential cross-section is (|f|^2) * something in terms of angles.

Wait, but the exact formula is that the differential cross-section dσ/dΩ is |f(θ)|^2 multiplied by (something), but perhaps the exact units aren't crucial here. The important point is that the imaginary part of f is the quantity we're calculating.

Wait, but looking back, the formula for f(0) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(1). Since P_l(1)=1, the sum is (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l] which can be expressed as (2l+1) [sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l)] = (2l+1) [ sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ].

So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by (1/k).

But then, the units of f should be in length. So [f] = [1/k] * [sum], and k is in fm^-1. So [1/k] is fm.

So the calculation is correct in units, giving us approximately 35.56 fm. But looking at the options, none of them match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the sum.

l=0: (2*0+1) =1. Sin(90)=1, so 1*1^2=1 →1.

l=1:3. Sin(67)=0.9205, square is 0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419 → sum=1+2.5419=3.5419.

l=2:5. Sin(55)=0.8192 → square 0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355 → sum=6.8969.

l=3:7. Sin(30)=0.5 → square 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75 → sum=8.6469.

l=4:9. Sin(13)=0.22495 → square 0.0506. 9*0.0506=0.4554 → sum=9.1023.

So sum S=9.1023.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Wait, the problem states: δ_o=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13. So l=0 to l=4, each with those respective δ values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula includes a factor of (1/k) multiplied by (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. But in reality, the formula is sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), and then all divided by k.

So in our case, at θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Which, when taking the imaginary part, is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees? No, the problem states them as degrees: 90, 67, etc.

Wait, but wait! 90 degrees is pi/2 radians. Maybe I should compute the sine in radians. Let me recheck the calculations using radians.

Sin(90 degrees) is 1. So that's correct.

Sin(67 degrees) in radians is 67 * pi/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians. Sin(1.16937) ≈ 0.9205, same as before.

Similarly, sin(55 degrees) in radians is 0.95993 radians. Sin(0.95993)=0.8192.

Sin(30 degrees) is 0.5, same as 0.5 radians? Wait, 30 degrees is pi/6 ≈0.5236 radians. Wait, no, that's about 0.5236 radians, but 30 degrees in radians is 0.5235988 radians. Wait, but sin(30 degrees) is 0.5. So that's correct.

Wait, so perhaps using degrees or radians makes no difference because the sine function's argument is in degrees as given. So no, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, so why are the options not matching? Let me look again.

Options:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, my result is ~35.56 fm, but the closest option is B)355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in how I calculated p. Oh wait! Because I used E as 50.511 MeV, but perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV exactly, as the problem states the electrons are 50 MeV. So mc² is 0.511 MeV, so E=50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

Wait, no, that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the total energy, not including the rest mass. That would be incorrect because for a particle, the total energy is kinetic plus rest mass. But perhaps the problem approximates E=50 MeV as the total energy, ignoring the rest mass. Let's see.

If E=50 MeV, then (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2 = 50^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈2500 -0.261 ≈2499.74 MeV².

So pc = sqrt(2499.74)=49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) = 49.9974 / (197.33) fm^-1 ≈ 0.2535 fm^-1.

So 1/k ≈3.943 fm.

Then, sum S=9.1023.

So 3.943 *9.1023 ≈35.83 fm.

Still around 35.83, still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is missing a factor of 2. Let me think: the scattering amplitude f is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). The imaginary part is the sum over l (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/k) P_l(1) → which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 1/(2k) somewhere. No, because the formula for f is (1/k) sum ( ... ), so the factor is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. But looking back, the problem states δ_0=90°, so that's definitely degrees.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me see what the options suggest. Option B is 355.35 fm, which is about 10 times my result. So perhaps I missed a factor of 100 somewhere.

Wait, the sum was 9.1023, and k was 0.256 fm^-1. So 1/k is ~3.906 fm.

3.906 *9.1023 = approx 35.56 fm.

But option B is 355.35, which is 10 times that. So perhaps I forgot to multiply by 100 because MeV is being treated differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have considered the fact that k is in fm^-1, and the result should be in fm.

Wait, no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (1/2), but I don't see why.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. The scattering amplitude f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). The imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/k), as earlier.

Wait, could it be that the correct formula includes a factor of 1/(2k)? No, I don't think so. Because each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute each term accurately.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. δ=90°, sin=1. So 1*1=1.

l=1: 3. δ=67°, sin(67)=approx 0.9205. 0.9205^2 =0.8473. 3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5. δ=55°, sin(55)= approx 0.8192. Square is 0.6710. 5 *0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7. δ=30°, sin=0.5. Square=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9. δ=13°, sin(13)= approx0.22495. Square≈0.0506. 9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

So sum is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the formula should be (1/(2k)) times the sum, but I don't recall any such factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} -1 ] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). No, I think that's not the case. The standard formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Another thought: perhaps I used the wrong phase shifts. The problem statement says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So we're only considering l=0 to 4. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, which would change the calculation. Let me check.

If δ_0=90 degrees is π/2 radians. So sin(π/2)=1.

Same for other terms. So using radians wouldn't change the calculations.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one is in the right ballpark. My calculation gives around 35.5 fm, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B) 355.35 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me redo the calculation of k more accurately.

k = (E² - (m c²)^2)^(1/2) / (ħ c).

E =50.511 MeV.

E^2 = (50.511)^2 =2551.31 MeV².

m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

(m c²)^2=0.261 MeV².

So (E^2 - (m c²)^2 )=2551.31 -0.261=2551.05 MeV².

sqrt(2551.05)=50.509 MeV.

So, pc =50.509 MeV.

So, p=50.509 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50.509 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) )

The MeV and c units cancel, so k=50.509 /197.33 fm^-1 ≈0.25597 fm^-1.

So, 1/k ≈3.906 fm.

So, 3.906 *9.1023=35.56 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total cross-section instead of the amplitude. But no, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians. Let's see what happens if I treat them as radians.

But that would make the sines much smaller. For example, δ_0=90 degrees is π/2 radians. So sin(π/2)=1, same as before.

δ_1=67 degrees is 67 * pi/180 ≈1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205, same as before.

So, using radians doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula for the scattering amplitude.

In the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 somewhere that I missed. Let me think.

Wait, I have the same formula as before. I don't think there's a factor of 2 missing.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is actually asking for the real part, but no, the question asks for the imaginary part.

I'm starting to think that perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, or perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. But given that the options don't align with my calculation, perhaps I should look for an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 50 GeV instead of 50 MeV? That would change things significantly. But the problem states 50 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the non-relativistic expression for k, which is k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), where E is the kinetic energy.

But for a 50 MeV electron, which is much higher energy than the rest mass (~0.511 MeV), the relativistic approach is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula for f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), but when taking the imaginary part, perhaps I missed a factor from the exponential.

Wait, for each term, (2l+1) e^{iδ} sin δ = (2l+1) (cos δ +i sin δ) sin δ = (2l+1) (sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ).

So, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ.

Yes, which is what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the magnitude of the amplitude, not the imaginary part? No, the question says to find the imaginary part.

I'm stuck. My calculation gives about 35.56 fm, which isn't any of the given options. The closest is option B) 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the sum, and the actual sum is 91.023 instead of 9.1023. Let me check the sum again.

No, I had l=0:1, l=1:2.5419, l=2:3.355, l=3:1.75, l=4:0.4554. Sum is 9.1023.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the sum as 91.023, which is 10 times larger. How? Oh, perhaps I forgot that each (2l+1) is multiplied by 10.

No, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts were given in radians, and I should compute sin(π/2) etc. But no, that gives the same result.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the phase shifts in the formula as (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (1 - cos δ_l), but that's not the standard formula. The standard formula uses sin δ_l.

I think I've done everything correctly, but perhaps the intended answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which would imply that the correct sum S is 91.023 instead of 9.1023. So perhaps during the sum calculation, I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. sin(90)=1. 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3. sin(67)=0.9205. 0.9205^2=0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5. sin(55)=0.8192. 0.8192^2=0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7. sin(30)=0.5. 0.5^2=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9. sin(13)=0.22495. 0.22495^2=0.0506. 9*0.0506=0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) times sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l). Because sometimes in scattering, the optical theorem uses 1 - cos δ. But no, the standard formula uses sin δ.

Wait, the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The formula is Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total.

But perhaps that's not directly applicable here, unless given σ_total, but the problem doesn't provide that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, but no, it's the imaginary part.

I'm at a loss. My calculation leads me to approximately 35.56 fm, which isn't an option. But option B is 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 in the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are given for each l, and perhaps the sum should be multiplied by a factor of 10. But that's not based on any formula I know.

Another thought: the energy is 50 MeV, but perhaps I should have used 500 MeV? That would change k to 500/197.33 ≈2.53 fm^-1, leading to 1/k≈0.395 fm. Then 0.395 *9.1023≈3.60 fm, which is even smaller. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k. Let me recompute 1/k.

k=0.25597 fm^-1 → 1/k= 3.906 fm.

3.906 *9.1023≈35.56 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is about 7 times larger. But why would that be the case? I don't see any calculation leading to that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for the total cross-section, which is 4π/k² sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l). But that's for the total cross-section, not the amplitude.

Wait, the question is about the scattering amplitude, not cross-section. So perhaps the formula I used is correct.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer based on my calculation is approximately 35.56 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, the intended answer might be B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger, possibly due to a miscalculation of the sum.

But I can't find any mistake in my calculations. So perhaps the intended answer is B) 355.351 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the incident direction (θ = 0°) using the partial wave expansion formula:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l P_l(1),
\]

where \(P_l(1) = 1\) for all \(l\), and the imaginary part is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the wave number \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the momentum \(p\) by \(k = p / \hbar\). For a relativistic electron with energy \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), the momentum is calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.
\]

Here, \(m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}\), so:

\[
(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 50.511^2 - 0.511^2 \approx 2551.05 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]

\[
pc = \sqrt{2551.05} \approx 50.509 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Using \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), the wave number becomes:

\[
k = \frac{pc}{\hbar c} = \frac{50.509}{197.33} \approx 0.256 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \(\sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l\)
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), compute \((2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l\):

- \(l = 0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
- \(l = 1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419\),
- \(l = 2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 = 3.355\),
- \(l = 3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
- \(l = 4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554.\)

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the imaginary part of \(f(0)\)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = \frac{1}{0.256} \cdot 9.1023 \approx 3.906 \cdot 9.1023 \approx 35.56 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(35.56 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option **B) 355.351 fm** is exactly 10 times larger than the result. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or options, such as a missing factor of 10 in the units or interpretation of the phase shifts.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculation, the closest option is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me remember what I know about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. From my notes, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of partial waves, each with their own phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over these partial waves. Oh right, the general expression is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cos θ), where δ_l is the phase shift for each angular momentum l, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. Oh right, along the beam means θ = 0 degrees. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0).

Let me think about how to compute f(0). The formula at θ=0 would involve each term's contribution when θ is zero. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l, since P_l(1) = 1. So each term simplifies to (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. So the amplitude at θ=0 is (1/k) times the sum from l=0 to ... (but we are ignoring higher phase shifts beyond l=4 as per the problem statement).

So f(0) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. But wait, the problem gives δ_o=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13. So l=0 to 4. 

Wait, let me clarify what each δ represents. δ_0 is the l=0 phase shift, δ_1 is l=1, etc. So yes, for each l, I need to compute (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

But wait, the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term multiplied by 1/k. Because each term is a complex number, and when I sum all the terms, their imaginary parts add up.

So, let me compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.

The imaginary part of e^{iδ} is sinδ, so for each term (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(δ_l) * sin(δ_l), because e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ, so multiplying by sinδ gives (2l+1) [sinδ * (sinδ + i cosδ)]. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. Let's write e^{iδ} as cosδ + i sinδ. So the term becomes (2l+1)(cosδ + i sinδ) sinδ. Expanding that, it's (2l+1)(cosδ sinδ + i sin²δ). 

So the imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So the total imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Wait, that makes sense. So the imaginary part Im[f(0)] is (1/k) multiplied by the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

So, I need to compute each (2l+1) * sin^2(δ_l), sum them up, and then multiply by 1/k.

But wait, what is k? k is the wave number. And since the electrons are in a nuclear target, I think we should use the relation that k is related to the momentum of the electron.

Wait, the electrons are 50 MeV. So to find k, I need to compute the momentum of the electron. The energy is given as 50 MeV. So the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, but I think for a non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), where m is the electron mass. But wait, 50 MeV is a significant fraction of the electron rest mass (which is about 0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects might be important. Hmm, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, but nothing about relativistic effects, so maybe I can approximate using non-relativistic formulas.

Wait, but 50 MeV is 50 million eV, which is 5e7 eV. The rest mass is 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is about 98 times the rest mass. So definitely relativistic. So perhaps I should compute the relativistic momentum.

The total energy E of the electron is given by the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Wait, but in high-energy physics, the electron's total energy is much bigger than its rest mass. So E ≈ pc, because for relativistic particles, E ≈ pc.

Wait, but wait. The kinetic energy K is given as 50 MeV. The total energy E is then K + mc². So E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV. But since 50 is much larger, perhaps E ≈ 50 MeV. So E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/c. Wait, but let's think about units.

I'm a bit confused about energy, momentum, and mass. Let me write the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

Given that E = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV. So E ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So, (pc c)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2.

Wait, no: (pc)^2 = (E)^2 - (mc²)^2.

Wait, E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So, solving for pc: pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2).

So, let's compute that. E = 50.511 MeV, mc² = 0.511 MeV.

E² = (50.511)^2 ≈ (50.5)^2 = 2550.25 (MeV)^2.

(mc²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = 2550.25 - 0.261 ≈ 2549.99 (MeV)^2.

So pc ≈ sqrt(2549.99) ≈ 50.497 MeV. So p ≈ 50.497 MeV / c.

But wait, momentum p has units of MeV/c. So k is the wave number, which is p/ħ.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But since we're dealing with energies in MeV and c in terms of these units, perhaps I can express k in terms of inverse fermi (fm^-1), since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between k and p. Since k = p/ħ.

But to compute k in atomic units or in appropriate units, let's think about the formula.

Wait, another approach: the wave number k is given by k = (p)/ħ. So, once I have p in units of MeV/c, I can convert p to kg·m/s, then divide by ħ to get k in m^-1.

But that might involve a lot of unit conversions. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to calculate k in terms of MeV and known constants.

Wait, I know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So that's a useful constant.

So, if p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV·fm, then p (MeV/c) multiplied by ħ c gives p * ħ c = (MeV/c) * MeV·fm = (MeV^2·fm) / c. Wait, not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, since p = E/c (for relativistic particles where E ≈ pc), and ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so k = p/ħ = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c) * (1/c) *c? Wait, perhaps let me compute it step by step.

Wait, p = E/(c) because for relativistic particles, E ≈ pc.

So p = 50.511 MeV/c.

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50.511 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

So, substituting, k = (50.511 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV·fm) / c ) ].

The c's cancel out, and MeV units cancel. So,

k = 50.511 / 197.33 fm^-1.

Calculating that: 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm^-1.

Wait, 50.511 divided by 197.33 is approximately what? Let me compute 197.33 *0.25=49.3325. So 0.25 gives about 49.33. The numerator is 50.511, which is a bit more. So 0.256? Let's compute 197.33 *0.256:

0.25 *197.33 =49.3325

0.006 *197.33=1.184

So 49.3325 +1.184=50.5165. Wait, that's very close to 50.511. So 0.256 gives about 50.5165, which is a tiny bit more than 50.511. So perhaps 0.256 minus a fraction. Let's compute 0.256 *197.33.

197.33 *0.256: 197.33 *0.2=39.466, 0.05=9.8665, 0.006=1.18398. So 39.466 +9.8665=49.3325, plus 1.18398=50.5165. So 197.33 *0.256=50.5165. So 50.511/197.33 = approximately 0.256 - (50.5165-50.511)/(197.33). The difference is 0.0055. So 0.0055/197.33≈ 0.000028. So 0.256 - 0.000028 ≈ 0.255972.

So k≈0.256 fm^-1.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 50.511 /197.33.

Wait, 197.33 *0.256=50.5165 as before.

So 50.511 is 0.0055 less than 50.5165. So 0.0055/197.33 ≈ 2.786e-5.

So 50.511/197.33 ≈ 0.256 - 2.786e-5 ≈ 0.255972 (approx 0.25597).

So k ≈0.25597 fm^-1. I'll keep a few more decimal places for accuracy, but perhaps I can use k≈0.256 fm^-1 for calculation purposes.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me try 50.511 divided by 197.33.

Let me compute 197.33 * x =50.511.

So x=50.511/197.33 ≈ 0.25597.

So k≈0.25597 fm^-1.

Now, moving on. So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) multiplied by the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin²(δ_l).

So let's compute each term (2l+1)*sin²(δ_l):

For l=0: (2*0+1)=1. δ_0=90 degrees. sin(90)=1. So 1 *1^2=1.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ_1=67 degrees. Sin(67) is approximately 0.9205. So 3*(0.9205)^2 =3*(0.8473)=2.5418.

l=2: (5) * sin²(55). Sin(55)≈0.8192. (0.8192)^2≈0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3: (7)* sin²(30). Sin(30)=0.5. So 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4: (9) * sin²(13). Sin(13)≈0.22495. Squared is about 0.0506. 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Now, summing all these up:

l=0: 1.0

l=1: 2.5418 → total so far 3.5418

l=2: 3.355 → total 6.8968

l=3: 1.75 → total 8.6468

l=4: 0.4554 → total 9.1022.

So sum =9.1022.

So the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum → (1/0.25597 fm^-1) * 9.1022.

Wait, 1/k is (1 /0.25597 fm^-1) ) = 3.907 fm.

So 3.907 fm *9.1022 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.907 *9.1022.

3 *9=27.

0.907 *9=8.163.

3.907 *0.1022≈0.3994.

So total approximates to 27 +8.163=35.163 +0.3994≈35.562.

Wait, but that's a rough calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

3.907 *9.1022.

= 3.907 *9 + 3.907 *0.1022.

3.907 *9=35.163.

3.907 *0.1022= approx 3.907 *0.1=0.3907, plus 3.907 *0.0022≈0.008595. So total 0.3907 +0.008595≈0.3993.

So 35.163+0.3993=35.5623 fm.

So approximately 35.562 fm. Looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Option C is about 177.675, which is roughly half of B. Option D is 251, which is about 2/3 of B.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because the result I'm getting is about 35.56 fm, but the options are much larger. Let me see.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check the calculation of k.

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated k. Because when I calculated p = E/c, but E is 50.511 MeV, but p is in units of MeV/c. Then, when calculating k = p / ħ, perhaps I should use the correct units for ħ.

Wait, more accurately, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c^2? No, wait. Let me think again. The speed of light c is in m/s. So perhaps I should think in terms where c is 1, but in appropriate units.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute k in terms of inverse meters, but then convert to inverse femtometers.

Wait, let's compute k more accurately.

Given that k = p/(ħ).

But p is 50.511 MeV/c.

So, I need to express p in kg·m/s, then divide by ħ (in J·s) to get k in m^-1.

Let's see:

1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J.

So p = 50.511 MeV/c = (50.511e6 * 1.60218e-13 J) / (2.998e8 m/s).

Wait, wait, calculation:

p = (50.511e6 eV) * (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ) / (2.998e8 m/s).

Because 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

So:

p = (50.511e6 * 1.60218e-19) / 2.998e8

Compute numerator: 50.511e6 *1.60218e-19 = 50.511 * 1.60218e-13 = approx 50.511 *1.60218e-13 = ?

50 *1.60218e-13 = 8.0109e-12.

0.511 *1.60218e-13 = approx 8.18e-14.

Total = 8.0109e-12 + 8.18e-14 ≈ 8.0927e-12 kg·m/s.

Divide by 2.998e8 m/s.

p = (8.0927e-12) / (2.998e8) ≈ 2.70e-20 kg·m/s.

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = p / ħ = (2.70e-20) / (1.0545718e-34) ) ≈ 2.56e14 m^-1.

Wait, m^-1 is inverse meters. To convert to inverse femtometers (fm^-1), since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so 1 m = 1e15 fm.

So 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

Wait, no. Because 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So k in fm^-1 is (2.56e14 m^-1) * (1e15 fm/m) )^-1 → wait, let's think again.

Wait, 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 → 1 m^-1 = 1e-15 fm^-1.

So k = 2.56e14 m^-1 → in fm^-1, it's 2.56e14 * 1e-15 fm^-1 = 2.56e-1 fm^-1 = 0.256 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.256 fm^-1, which matches the previous calculation.

So the earlier value of k is correct.

So, the sum S is 9.1022, so (1/k) * S = (1/0.256) * 9.1022 = 3.90625 *9.1022 ≈ 35.56 fm.

So the imaginary part is approximately 35.56 fm. But looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait a minute! Did I miscalculate the sum? Let me recheck the sum.

Sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1)* sin²δ_l.

l=0: 1 * sin²(90) →1*1=1 → sum=1.

l=1: 3 * sin²(67). Sin(67)=approx 0.9205 → 0.9205²= approx 0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419 → sum=3.5419.

l=2:5 * sin²(55). Sin(55)=approx 0.8192 → 0.6710. 5 *0.6710=3.355 → sum=6.8969.

l=3:7 * sin²(30). Sin(30)=0.5 → 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75 → sum=8.6469.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)=approx 0.22495 → 0.0506. 9 *0.0506=0.4554 → sum=9.1023.

So sum S is approx 9.1023.

So (1/k)*S = (1/0.256) *9.1023 ≈ 3.90625 *9.1023 = approx 35.56 fm.

But none of the options match this. The closest option is B) 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I see the mistake. Oh wait! Because when calculating k, I used p as the momentum, which is correct, but when determining E, I think I may have missed including the rest mass properly. Wait, the given energy is 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. So the total energy E is K + m c².

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I used E = 50.511 MeV, which is correct. But when I compute p, perhaps I should use E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So p = sqrt( E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c.

So let me recompute p correctly.

E =50.511 MeV.

mc² =0.511 MeV.

E² = (50.511)^2 = 2551.31 MeV².

(mc²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.2611 MeV².

So (pc)^2 = 2551.31 -0.2611 ≈2551.05 MeV².

So pc = sqrt(2551.05) ≈50.509 MeV.

So p = (50.509 MeV) / c.

So, now, to compute p in kg·m/s, I need to convert 50.509 MeV/c into SI units.

Wait, another approach: since we have ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm, and p = E/c for E >> mc².

Wait, perhaps I can compute k using the correct formula.

k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c).

But E is 50.511 MeV, and ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = (50.511 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → which is 50.511 /197.33 fm^-1.

Which, as before, is approximately 0.25597 fm^-1.

So that part is correct. So why is the sum leading to 35.56 fm, but the options are much larger?

Wait a minute! Wait, perhaps I have mixed up the formula. The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (since it's a measure of cross-section times solid angle). Wait, but cross-section σ is |f|^2 * (4π/k²) or something like that, but the amplitude f itself is dimensionless? No, wait, no, I think f has units of length, because cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by some factors, but I might be getting confused.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is in units of length (fm, for example). Because the differential cross-section is (|f|^2) * something in terms of angles.

Wait, but the exact formula is that the differential cross-section dσ/dΩ is |f(θ)|^2 multiplied by (something), but perhaps the exact units aren't crucial here. The important point is that the imaginary part of f is the quantity we're calculating.

Wait, but looking back, the formula for f(0) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(1). Since P_l(1)=1, the sum is (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l] which can be expressed as (2l+1) [sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l)] = (2l+1) [ sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ].

So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by (1/k).

But then, the units of f should be in length. So [f] = [1/k] * [sum], and k is in fm^-1. So [1/k] is fm.

So the calculation is correct in units, giving us approximately 35.56 fm. But looking at the options, none of them match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the sum.

l=0: (2*0+1) =1. Sin(90)=1, so 1*1^2=1 →1.

l=1:3. Sin(67)=0.9205, square is 0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419 → sum=1+2.5419=3.5419.

l=2:5. Sin(55)=0.8192 → square 0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355 → sum=6.8969.

l=3:7. Sin(30)=0.5 → square 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75 → sum=8.6469.

l=4:9. Sin(13)=0.22495 → square 0.0506. 9*0.0506=0.4554 → sum=9.1023.

So sum S=9.1023.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Wait, the problem states: δ_o=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13. So l=0 to l=4, each with those respective δ values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula includes a factor of (1/k) multiplied by (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. But in reality, the formula is sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), and then all divided by k.

So in our case, at θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Which, when taking the imaginary part, is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees? No, the problem states them as degrees: 90, 67, etc.

Wait, but wait! 90 degrees is pi/2 radians. Maybe I should compute the sine in radians. Let me recheck the calculations using radians.

Sin(90 degrees) is 1. So that's correct.

Sin(67 degrees) in radians is 67 * pi/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians. Sin(1.16937) ≈ 0.9205, same as before.

Similarly, sin(55 degrees) in radians is 0.95993 radians. Sin(0.95993)=0.8192.

Sin(30 degrees) is 0.5, same as 0.5 radians? Wait, 30 degrees is pi/6 ≈0.5236 radians. Wait, no, that's about 0.5236 radians, but 30 degrees in radians is 0.5235988 radians. Wait, but sin(30 degrees) is 0.5. So that's correct.

Wait, so perhaps using degrees or radians makes no difference because the sine function's argument is in degrees as given. So no, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, so why are the options not matching? Let me look again.

Options:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, my result is ~35.56 fm, but the closest option is B)355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger. Did I miss a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in how I calculated p. Oh wait! Because I used E as 50.511 MeV, but perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV exactly, as the problem states the electrons are 50 MeV. So mc² is 0.511 MeV, so E=50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

Wait, no, that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the total energy, not including the rest mass. That would be incorrect because for a particle, the total energy is kinetic plus rest mass. But perhaps the problem approximates E=50 MeV as the total energy, ignoring the rest mass. Let's see.

If E=50 MeV, then (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2 = 50^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈2500 -0.261 ≈2499.74 MeV².

So pc = sqrt(2499.74)=49.9974 MeV.

So p=49.9974 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) = 49.9974 / (197.33) fm^-1 ≈ 0.2535 fm^-1.

So 1/k ≈3.943 fm.

Then, sum S=9.1023.

So 3.943 *9.1023 ≈35.83 fm.

Still around 35.83, still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is missing a factor of 2. Let me think: the scattering amplitude f is given by (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). The imaginary part is the sum over l (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/k) P_l(1) → which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 1/(2k) somewhere. No, because the formula for f is (1/k) sum ( ... ), so the factor is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. But looking back, the problem states δ_0=90°, so that's definitely degrees.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me see what the options suggest. Option B is 355.35 fm, which is about 10 times my result. So perhaps I missed a factor of 100 somewhere.

Wait, the sum was 9.1023, and k was 0.256 fm^-1. So 1/k is ~3.906 fm.

3.906 *9.1023 = approx 35.56 fm.

But option B is 355.35, which is 10 times that. So perhaps I forgot to multiply by 100 because MeV is being treated differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have considered the fact that k is in fm^-1, and the result should be in fm.

Wait, no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (1/2), but I don't see why.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. The scattering amplitude f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). The imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l * (1/k), as earlier.

Wait, could it be that the correct formula includes a factor of 1/(2k)? No, I don't think so. Because each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l, and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute each term accurately.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. δ=90°, sin=1. So 1*1=1.

l=1: 3. δ=67°, sin(67)=approx 0.9205. 0.9205^2 =0.8473. 3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5. δ=55°, sin(55)= approx 0.8192. Square is 0.6710. 5 *0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7. δ=30°, sin=0.5. Square=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9. δ=13°, sin(13)= approx0.22495. Square≈0.0506. 9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

So sum is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the formula should be (1/(2k)) times the sum, but I don't recall any such factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} -1 ] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). No, I think that's not the case. The standard formula is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Another thought: perhaps I used the wrong phase shifts. The problem statement says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So we're only considering l=0 to 4. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, which would change the calculation. Let me check.

If δ_0=90 degrees is π/2 radians. So sin(π/2)=1.

Same for other terms. So using radians wouldn't change the calculations.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one is in the right ballpark. My calculation gives around 35.5 fm, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B) 355.35 fm, which is about 10 times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me redo the calculation of k more accurately.

k = (E² - (m c²)^2)^(1/2) / (ħ c).

E =50.511 MeV.

E^2 = (50.511)^2 =2551.31 MeV².

m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

(m c²)^2=0.261 MeV².

So (E^2 - (m c²)^2 )=2551.31 -0.261=2551.05 MeV².

sqrt(2551.05)=50.509 MeV.

So, pc =50.509 MeV.

So, p=50.509 MeV/c.

Now, ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50.509 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) )

The MeV and c units cancel, so k=50.509 /197.33 fm^-1 ≈0.25597 fm^-1.

So, 1/k ≈3.906 fm.

So, 3.906 *9.1023=35.56 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total cross-section instead of the amplitude. But no, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians. Let's see what happens if I treat them as radians.

But that would make the sines much smaller. For example, δ_0=90 degrees is π/2 radians. So sin(π/2)=1, same as before.

δ_1=67 degrees is 67 * pi/180 ≈1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205, same as before.

So, using radians doesn't change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula for the scattering amplitude.

In the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 somewhere that I missed. Let me think.

Wait, I have the same formula as before. I don't think there's a factor of 2 missing.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is actually asking for the real part, but no, the question asks for the imaginary part.

I'm starting to think that perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, or perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. But given that the options don't align with my calculation, perhaps I should look for an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy is 50 GeV instead of 50 MeV? That would change things significantly. But the problem states 50 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the non-relativistic expression for k, which is k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), where E is the kinetic energy.

But for a 50 MeV electron, which is much higher energy than the rest mass (~0.511 MeV), the relativistic approach is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula for f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), but when taking the imaginary part, perhaps I missed a factor from the exponential.

Wait, for each term, (2l+1) e^{iδ} sin δ = (2l+1) (cos δ +i sin δ) sin δ = (2l+1) (sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ).

So, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ.

Yes, which is what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the magnitude of the amplitude, not the imaginary part? No, the question says to find the imaginary part.

I'm stuck. My calculation gives about 35.56 fm, which isn't any of the given options. The closest is option B) 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the sum, and the actual sum is 91.023 instead of 9.1023. Let me check the sum again.

No, I had l=0:1, l=1:2.5419, l=2:3.355, l=3:1.75, l=4:0.4554. Sum is 9.1023.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the sum as 91.023, which is 10 times larger. How? Oh, perhaps I forgot that each (2l+1) is multiplied by 10.

No, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts were given in radians, and I should compute sin(π/2) etc. But no, that gives the same result.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the phase shifts in the formula as (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (1 - cos δ_l), but that's not the standard formula. The standard formula uses sin δ_l.

I think I've done everything correctly, but perhaps the intended answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which would imply that the correct sum S is 91.023 instead of 9.1023. So perhaps during the sum calculation, I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. sin(90)=1. 1 *1 =1.

l=1:3. sin(67)=0.9205. 0.9205^2=0.8473. 3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5. sin(55)=0.8192. 0.8192^2=0.6710. 5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7. sin(30)=0.5. 0.5^2=0.25. 7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9. sin(13)=0.22495. 0.22495^2=0.0506. 9*0.0506=0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) times sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l). Because sometimes in scattering, the optical theorem uses 1 - cos δ. But no, the standard formula uses sin δ.

Wait, the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The formula is Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total.

But perhaps that's not directly applicable here, unless given σ_total, but the problem doesn't provide that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the real part, but no, it's the imaginary part.

I'm at a loss. My calculation leads me to approximately 35.56 fm, which isn't an option. But option B is 355.351 fm, which is exactly 10 times larger. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 in the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are given for each l, and perhaps the sum should be multiplied by a factor of 10. But that's not based on any formula I know.

Another thought: the energy is 50 MeV, but perhaps I should have used 500 MeV? That would change k to 500/197.33 ≈2.53 fm^-1, leading to 1/k≈0.395 fm. Then 0.395 *9.1023≈3.60 fm, which is even smaller. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k. Let me recompute 1/k.

k=0.25597 fm^-1 → 1/k= 3.906 fm.

3.906 *9.1023≈35.56 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is about 7 times larger. But why would that be the case? I don't see any calculation leading to that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for the total cross-section, which is 4π/k² sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l). But that's for the total cross-section, not the amplitude.

Wait, the question is about the scattering amplitude, not cross-section. So perhaps the formula I used is correct.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer based on my calculation is approximately 35.56 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, the intended answer might be B) 355.351 fm, which is 10 times larger, possibly due to a miscalculation of the sum.

But I can't find any mistake in my calculations. So perhaps the intended answer is B) 355.351 fm.


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the incident direction (θ = 0°) using the partial wave expansion formula:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l P_l(1),
\]

where \(P_l(1) = 1\) for all \(l\), and the imaginary part is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the wave number \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the momentum \(p\) by \(k = p / \hbar\). For a relativistic electron with energy \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), the momentum is calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.
\]

Here, \(m c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}\), so:

\[
(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 50.511^2 - 0.511^2 \approx 2551.05 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]

\[
pc = \sqrt{2551.05} \approx 50.509 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Using \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), the wave number becomes:

\[
k = \frac{pc}{\hbar c} = \frac{50.509}{197.33} \approx 0.256 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \(\sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l\)
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), compute \((2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l\):

- \(l = 0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\),
- \(l = 1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419\),
- \(l = 2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 = 3.355\),
- \(l = 3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\),
- \(l = 4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554.\)

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the imaginary part of \(f(0)\)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l = \frac{1}{0.256} \cdot 9.1023 \approx 3.906 \cdot 9.1023 \approx 35.56 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \(35.56 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, option **B) 355.351 fm** is exactly 10 times larger than the result. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or options, such as a missing factor of 10 in the units or interpretation of the phase shifts.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculation, the closest option is:

**Answer: B**
