Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. A 6-membered aromatic ring means it's probably benzene or a substituted benzene. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total carbon count is 8, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons because benzene has 6 carbons. Wait, no, wait. Because the ring is 6-membered, but if it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent could be more than one carbon. Let me think: if the ring is 6 carbons, and substituents add 2 more, that makes 8. So each substituent must be a group that's either -X (like halogen) or a carbonyl group (like ketone, aldehyde, etc.), but wait, a carbonyl group might be part of a substituent.

Wait, but FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Oh wait, but wait: the carbonyl could be part of a substituent. So maybe the substituents are, say, an aldehyde group and a halide (like Br or Cl). Or maybe a ketone.

Wait, but wait, the FTIR indicates a carbonyl (like C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the molecule has both a C=O group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene could be a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen (like Cl or Br). So for example, maybe it's something like para-substituted benzaldehyde with a halogen, or maybe it's a ketone and a halogen.

But wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. Let's think about the structure. Let's say benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like -CO-R) and another is a halogen (like -X). Alternatively, one substituent could have both a carbonyl and a halogen, but that's less likely because the carbonyl and halogen are usually in different groups.

Wait, but wait, the total number of carbons is 8. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. So substituents add two more carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon group, except perhaps when considering branching. Wait, for example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like -COH (but that's not possible without more), or perhaps -CHO (aldehyde), which is a substituent with one carbon. Another substituent could be a halogen (-X), which is a single atom, not a carbon. So that would add zero carbons from substituents, but the substituents would account for 1 (CHO) and 0 (X), making the total carbons 6 + 1 + 0 =7. But the question says 8 carbons. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me think again. The compound is a di-substituted benzene with 8 carbons in total. So 6 from the ring, 2 from substituents. So substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So possible substituents could be a carbonyl group (like -CO-R) where R is a methyl group, but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, substituents could be one -CO- (but that's part of the ring, but that's unlikely). Wait, perhaps one substituent is an aldehyde (-CHO, which is 1 carbon) and the other is a methyl group (but then no carbonyl). But according to the IR data, there must be a carbonyl, so perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other substituent is a methyl group. Wait, but the IR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen (X), and the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO- something) and a halogen. Let's see: for example, if the substituents are -COCH3 (which is an acetyl group, 2 carbons) and a Cl. So that would make substituent carbons: 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 2, which adds to the ring's 6, making 8. That works.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a -COOH group, which is 2 carbons (the COOH is OOH with a carbonyl), but that's another possibility.

Wait, let's think about the structure. So benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl or Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, such as a ketone (like -COCH3), an aldehyde (-CHO), ester (-COOR), etc.

But the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl group with one carbon (like -CHO), then the other substituent is a halogen (0 carbons). So total substituents' carbons would be 1 (CHO) + 0 (X) =1. But the ring has 6, so total is 7, which is less than 8. Oh, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again: the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6, so substituents must add 2. So substituents must contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent could be, for example, a -CH2- group, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, but substituents can be a -CO- group and a -CH3. Or perhaps two substituents each contributing one carbon. For example, the substituents are -X (Cl) and -COCH3 (which is two carbons: CO plus CH3). So that adds up to two substituent carbons. So that's possible.

Wait, but the substituents can't both be two carbons if the total is 8. Let me calculate: benzene (6) + substituent carbons (2) = 8. So substituents contribute two carbons total. So the substituents could be a carbonyl group with one carbon (like -CHO) and another substituent that's a methyl group (CH3). But then the substituents would be -CHO and -CH3, each taking one carbon. That adds up to 2, so total is 8.

Wait, but the IR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, so one substituent must be a halogen (like Cl), and the other must have the carbonyl. So substituents are -Cl and -COCH3. Wait, but COCH3 is two carbons. So substituents would be -Cl (0 carbons) and -COCH3 (2 carbons). So total substituents add 2 carbons. So benzene (6) + 2 =8. So that works.

So the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: Cl and COCH3. But wait, let me think about the positions. Di-substituted, so the two substituents are on adjacent carbons (ortho), opposite (para), or meta positions. But the substitution pattern would affect the NMR spectrum.

But wait, in the options, I see signals that suggest certain substitution patterns and groups. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests an aldehyde proton (CHO). Then 7.8 and 7.6 are doublets, which could be from two substituents on the ring. Also, 3.7 ppm (2H, s) could be a OCH2 group, but wait, that would be more like an ether, but if it's a COCH3 group, the CH3 would be around 2.1 ppm, but here it's 3.7. Hmm, maybe that's a methylene adjacent to something else. Wait, but in our structure, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the COCH3 would give a singlet at around 2.6 ppm for the CH3. But in option A, there's a singlet at 3.7 for 2H, which doesn't fit.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest maybe some oxygenated groups, like OCH2, but the molecule doesn't have such groups. Or maybe it's a vicinal diol, but I don't think that's the case here. Also, 1.3 ppm (3H, s) could be a methyl attached to something, but I'm not sure. This seems less likely because our substituents are Cl and COCH3.

Option C: 7.8 and 7.6 are doublets, which could be from a para-substituted ring. The 2.3 ppm (3H, s) could be a methyl group, like in COCH3. The aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9.9 ppm. Wait, so if the substituents are CHO and something else, but earlier I thought substituents must be Cl and COCH3. But in this option, there's no peak for Cl. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl and a methyl group. Hmm, but the IR says there's a halogen on the aromatic ring.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Let me consider the substituents.

The molecule has a carbonyl group (so C=O) and a halogen on the ring. So substituents are X (Cl or Br) and R'CO- group, perhaps.

Wait, but if substituent R'CO- is, say, a ketone group. For example, benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups. So the COCH3 would have a CH3 group, which would show up as a singlet around 2.1 ppm, perhaps. But in option C, the singlet is at 2.3, which is close. Also, the aromatic protons would depend on substitution pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a nitro group and a carbonyl, but the question says halogen. So back to substituents being X and CO-R.

Wait, for the structure, maybe it's 4-chloroacetophenone. Structure would be benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 groups, which would be in the para position. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which is what option C shows: 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d). The 2.3 ppm (3H, s) would be the COCH3 group. But where is the aldehyde proton? Wait, in this structure, it's a ketone, so there's no aldehyde proton. So option C's 9.9 ppm wouldn't be present. Wait, option C doesn't have a peak at 9.9. No, option C has only 7.8, 7.6, and 2.3. So perhaps the structure is without an aldehyde.

Wait, but the IR showed a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So maybe the structure is benzal chloride? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's chlorobenzaldehyde, which would have a benzene ring with Cl and CHO substituents. Let's see, that would be substituents as Cl and CHO. The carbons would be benzene (6) + Cl (0) + CHO (1) = 7, but the total is 8. So that can't be. So perhaps another possibility.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group as part of a larger substituent. For example, the substituent could be -COOCH3 (methyl ester), which is 3 carbons (COOCH3). But then substituents would add 3 carbons to the ring, making total 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the NMR options again.

The correct molecule has substituents that include a carbonyl group and a halogen. So the substituents are X and R-CO-.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has 8 carbons, which includes the benzene ring. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. So substituents could be -Cl and -COCH3 (which is two carbons from COCH3), but then substituents add 2 carbons. So benzaldehyde with Cl would have substituents CHO and Cl, but that's only 1 carbon (CHO), so 6 + 1 + 0 =7, which is not 8. So that's not possible.

Wait a minute, maybe the substituent is -COOR, where R is methyl. Then substituent is COOCH3, which is three carbons. But that would make total 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that's not possible.

Another possibility: substituents are -COH and -X. But that's a ketone, but I think that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group with one carbon, like -CHO (aldehyde), and the other substituent is a methyl group attached via a single bond to the ring, but that would add another carbon. Wait, but substituents are -CHO (1C) and -CH3 (1C), totaling 2. So benzene (6) + 2 =8. So the substituents are CHO and CH3. But then where is the halogen? Because the IR has a peak for aromatic-halogen bond. So that can't be. So substituents must include a halogen.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons, di-substituted benzene, carbonyl group, and halogen on the ring.

So substituents must be X (Cl, Br, etc.) and a group that contributes one or two carbons and includes a carbonyl.

If substituents are X and RCO..., and RCO contributes 1 or 2 carbons.

Wait, if RCO is CH3CO- (like acetophenone), then substituent is COCH3, which contributes 2 carbons.

So benzene (6) + COCH3 (2) + X (0) =8. That works. So substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the structure is 4-chloroacetophenone, which is para-substituted. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each with 2H, as in option C.

Option C's NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet for the CH3 in COCH3. That fits. But wait, where's the aldehyde proton? Oh, wait, in this structure, the substituent is a ketone (COCH3), so there's no aldehyde. So the NMR shouldn't have a peak around 9.9 ppm. But option C doesn't have that; it only has the aromatic and the CH3.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl peak, which is present whether it's a ketone or aldehyde. So that makes sense.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A has a singlet at 9.9, which suggests an aldehyde proton. So if the substituent were an aldehyde, the structure would be benzaldehyde with another substituent. But then the substituents would be CHO (1C) and X (Cl, 0C), making 6 +1 +0 =7, which is less than 8. So that's not possible. So substituent can't be aldehyde. Thus, option A can be ruled out.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are likely for some oxygen-bearing groups, like OCH2CH2O, but that doesn't fit. So probably not.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), which could be a proton in a meta position. Then 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), which might suggest something like a di-substituted oxygen group, like adjacent -OCH2CH2O- groups, but I'm not sure. Also, 1.3 (2H, s) is unclear. Doesn't seem to fit our substituent scenario.

So going back, the correct structure is benzene with Cl and COCH3 substituents, para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each 2H) around 7.6 and 7.8 ppm, as in option C.

So option C's NMR data would be correct. It shows 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s), which matches the COCH3 group.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. Based on the IR data, one substituent is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. 

Considering the total carbon count and the substituents, the structure is likely **4-chloroacetophenone**, where the substituents are a halogen (Cl) and a ketone group (-COCH₃). The ketone group contributes 2 carbons (from COCH₃), and the halogen contributes no carbons, satisfying the total of 8 carbons.

The NMR data must reflect this structure:
1. The aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring will appear as two doublets, one at higher chemical shift (7.8 ppm) and the other at a slightly lower shift (7.6 ppm).
2. The methyl group (CH₃) attached to the carbonyl will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which suggests an aldehyde proton. However, the substituents in this case would not satisfy the total carbon count (8 carbons). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of oxygenated groups like -OCH₂-. This does not match the expected structure of 4-chloroacetophenone. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Matches the expected NMR data for 4-chloroacetophenone. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), and the methyl group of the ketone appears as a singlet at 2.3 ppm. This option is correct.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm and signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which do not align with the expected structure of 4-chloroacetophenone. This option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. A 6-membered aromatic ring means it's probably benzene or a substituted benzene. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total carbon count is 8, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons because benzene has 6 carbons. Wait, no, wait. Because the ring is 6-membered, but if it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent could be more than one carbon. Let me think: if the ring is 6 carbons, and substituents add 2 more, that makes 8. So each substituent must be a group that's either -X (like halogen) or a carbonyl group (like ketone, aldehyde, etc.), but wait, a carbonyl group might be part of a substituent.

Wait, but FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Oh wait, but wait: the carbonyl could be part of a substituent. So maybe the substituents are, say, an aldehyde group and a halide (like Br or Cl). Or maybe a ketone.

Wait, but wait, the FTIR indicates a carbonyl (like C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the molecule has both a C=O group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene could be a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen (like Cl or Br). So for example, maybe it's something like para-substituted benzaldehyde with a halogen, or maybe it's a ketone and a halogen.

But wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. Let's think about the structure. Let's say benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like -CO-R) and another is a halogen (like -X). Alternatively, one substituent could have both a carbonyl and a halogen, but that's less likely because the carbonyl and halogen are usually in different groups.

Wait, but wait, the total number of carbons is 8. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. So substituents add two more carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon group, except perhaps when considering branching. Wait, for example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like -COH (but that's not possible without more), or perhaps -CHO (aldehyde), which is a substituent with one carbon. Another substituent could be a halogen (-X), which is a single atom, not a carbon. So that would add zero carbons from substituents, but the substituents would account for 1 (CHO) and 0 (X), making the total carbons 6 + 1 + 0 =7. But the question says 8 carbons. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me think again. The compound is a di-substituted benzene with 8 carbons in total. So 6 from the ring, 2 from substituents. So substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So possible substituents could be a carbonyl group (like -CO-R) where R is a methyl group, but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, substituents could be one -CO- (but that's part of the ring, but that's unlikely). Wait, perhaps one substituent is an aldehyde (-CHO, which is 1 carbon) and the other is a methyl group (but then no carbonyl).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO- something) and a halogen. Let's see: for example, if the substituents are -COCH3 (which is an acetyl group, 2 carbons) and a Cl. So that would make substituent carbons: 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 2, which adds to the ring's 6, making 8. That works.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a -COOH group, which is 2 carbons (the COOH is OOH with a carbonyl), but that's another possibility.

Wait, let's think about the structure. So benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl or Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, such as a ketone (like -COCH3), an aldehyde (-CHO), ester (-COOR), etc.

But the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl group with one carbon (like -CHO), then the other substituent is a halogen (0 carbons). So total substituents' carbons would be 1 (CHO) + 0 (X) =1. But the ring has 6, so total is 7, which is less than 8. Oh, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again: the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6, so substituents must add 2. So substituents must contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent could be, for example, a -CH2- group, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, but substituents can be a -CO- group and a -CH3. Or perhaps two substituents each contributing one carbon. For example, the substituents are -X (Cl) and -COCH3 (which is two carbons: CO plus CH3). So that adds up to two substituent carbons. So that's possible.

Wait, but the substituents can't both be two carbons if the total is 8. Let me calculate: benzene (6) + substituent carbons (2) = 8. So substituents contribute two carbons total. So the substituents could be a carbonyl group with one carbon (like -CHO) and another substituent that's a methyl group (CH3). But then the substituents would be -CHO and -CH3, each taking one carbon. That adds up to 2, so total is 8.

Wait, but the IR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, so one substituent must be a halogen (like Cl), and the other must have the carbonyl. So substituents are -Cl and -COCH3. Wait, but COCH3 is two carbons. So substituents would be -Cl (0 carbons) and -COCH3 (2 carbons). So total substituents add 2 carbons. So benzene (6) + 2 =8. So that works.

So the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: Cl and COCH3. But wait, let me think about the positions. Di-substituted, so the two substituents are on adjacent carbons (ortho), opposite (para), or meta positions. But the substitution pattern would affect the NMR spectrum.

But wait, in the options, I see signals that suggest certain substitution patterns and groups. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests an aldehyde proton (CHO). Then 7.8 and 7.6 are doublets, which could be from two substituents on the ring. Also, 3.7 ppm (2H, s) could be a OCH2 group, but wait, that would be more like an ether, but if it's a COCH3 group, the CH3 would be around 2.1 ppm, but here it's 3.7. Hmm, maybe that's a methylene adjacent to something else. Wait, but in our structure, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the COCH3 would give a singlet at around 2.6 ppm for the CH3. But in option A, there's a singlet at 3.7 for 2H, which doesn't fit.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest maybe some oxygenated groups, like OCH2, but the molecule doesn't have such groups. Or maybe it's a vicinal diol, but I don't think that's the case here. Also, 1.3 ppm (3H, s) could be a methyl attached to something, but I'm not sure. This seems less likely because our substituents are Cl and COCH3.

Option C: 7.8 and 7.6 are doublets, which could be from a para-substituted ring. The 2.3 ppm (3H, s) could be a methyl group, like in COCH3. The aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9.9 ppm. Wait, so if the substituents are CHO and something else, but earlier I thought substituents must be Cl and COCH3. But in this option, there's no peak for Cl. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl and a methyl group. Hmm, but the IR says there's a halogen on the aromatic ring.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Let me consider the substituents.

The molecule has a carbonyl group (so C=O) and a halogen on the ring. So substituents are X (Cl or Br) and R'CO- group, perhaps.

Wait, but if substituent R'CO- is, say, a ketone group. For example, benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups. So the COCH3 would have a CH3 group, which would show up as a singlet around 2.1 ppm, perhaps. But in option C, the singlet is at 2.3, which is close. Also, the aromatic protons would depend on substitution pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a nitro group and a carbonyl, but the question says halogen. So back to substituents being X and CO-R.

Wait, for the structure, maybe it's 4-chloroacetophenone. Structure would be benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 groups, which would be in the para position. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which is what option C shows: 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d). The 2.3 ppm (3H, s) would be the COCH3 group. But where is the aldehyde proton? Wait, in this structure, it's a ketone, so there's no aldehyde proton. So option C's 9.9 ppm wouldn't be present. Wait, option C doesn't have a peak at 9.9. No, option C has only 7.8, 7.6, and 2.3. So perhaps the structure is without an aldehyde.

Wait, but the IR showed a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So maybe the structure is benzal chloride? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's chlorobenzaldehyde, which would have a benzene ring with Cl and CHO substituents. Let's see, that would be substituents as Cl and CHO. The carbons would be benzene (6) + Cl (0) + CHO (1) = 7, but the total is 8. So that can't be. So perhaps another possibility.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group as part of a larger substituent. For example, the substituent could be -COOCH3 (methyl ester), which is 3 carbons (COOCH3). But then substituents would add 3 carbons to the ring, making total 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the NMR options again.

The correct molecule has substituents that include a carbonyl group and a halogen. So the substituents are X and R-CO-.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has 8 carbons, which includes the benzene ring. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. So substituents could be -Cl and -COCH3 (which is two carbons from COCH3), but then substituents add 2 carbons. So benzaldehyde with Cl would have substituents CHO and Cl, but that's only 1 carbon (CHO), so 6 + 1 + 0 =7, which is not 8. So that's not possible.

Wait a minute, maybe the substituent is -COOR, where R is methyl. Then substituent is COOCH3, which is three carbons. But that would make total 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that's not possible.

Another possibility: substituents are -COH and -X. But that's a ketone, but I think that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group with one carbon, like -CHO (aldehyde), and the other substituent is a methyl group attached via a single bond to the ring, but that would add another carbon. Wait, but substituents are -CHO (1C) and -CH3 (1C), totaling 2. So benzene (6) + 2 =8. So the substituents are CHO and CH3. But then where is the halogen? Because the IR has a peak for aromatic-halogen bond. So that can't be. So substituents must include a halogen.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons, di-substituted benzene, carbonyl group, and halogen on the ring.

So substituents must be X (Cl, Br, etc.) and a group that contributes one or two carbons and includes a carbonyl.

If substituents are X and RCO..., and RCO contributes 1 or 2 carbons.

Wait, if RCO is CH3CO- (like acetophenone), then substituent is COCH3, which contributes 2 carbons.

So benzene (6) + COCH3 (2) + X (0) =8. That works. So substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the structure is 4-chloroacetophenone, which is para-substituted. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each with 2H, as in option C.

Option C's NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet for the CH3 in COCH3. That fits. But wait, where's the aldehyde proton? Oh, wait, in this structure, the substituent is a ketone (COCH3), so there's no aldehyde. So the NMR shouldn't have a peak around 9.9 ppm. But option C doesn't have that; it only has the aromatic and the CH3.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl peak, which is present whether it's a ketone or aldehyde. So that makes sense.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A has a singlet at 9.9, which suggests an aldehyde proton. So if the substituent were an aldehyde, the structure would be benzaldehyde with another substituent. But then the substituents would be CHO (1C) and X (Cl, 0C), making 6 +1 +0 =7, which is less than 8. So that's not possible. So substituent can't be aldehyde. Thus, option A can be ruled out.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are likely for some oxygen-bearing groups, like OCH2CH2O, but that doesn't fit. So probably not.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), which could be a proton in a meta position. Then 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), which might suggest something like a di-substituted oxygen group, like adjacent -OCH2CH2O- groups, but I'm not sure. Also, 1.3 (2H, s) is unclear. Doesn't seem to fit our substituent scenario.

So going back, the correct structure is benzene with Cl and COCH3 substituents, para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each 2H) around 7.6 and 7.8 ppm, as in option C.

So option C's NMR data would be correct. It shows 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s), which matches the COCH3 group.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. Based on the IR data, one substituent is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. 

Considering the total carbon count and the substituents, the structure is likely **4-chloroacetophenone**, where the substituents are a halogen (Cl) and a ketone group (-COCH₃). The ketone group contributes 2 carbons (from COCH₃), and the halogen contributes no carbons, satisfying the total of 8 carbons.

The NMR data must reflect this structure:
1. The aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring will appear as two doublets, one at higher chemical shift (7.8 ppm) and the other at a slightly lower shift (7.6 ppm).
2. The methyl group (CH₃) attached to the carbonyl will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which suggests an aldehyde proton. However, the substituents in this case would not satisfy the total carbon count (8 carbons). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of oxygenated groups like -OCH₂-. This does not match the expected structure of 4-chloroacetophenone. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Matches the expected NMR data for 4-chloroacetophenone. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm), and the methyl group of the ketone appears as a singlet at 2.3 ppm. This option is correct.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm and signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which do not align with the expected structure of 4-chloroacetophenone. This option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**.
