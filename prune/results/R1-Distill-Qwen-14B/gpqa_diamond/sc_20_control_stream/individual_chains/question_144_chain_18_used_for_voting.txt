Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me see if I can figure this out.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ). But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. 

Wait, no, actually, isn't Γ the total decay width, and the lifetime is the inverse of the decay rate. So the proper formula is τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense because Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy times time, so the division gives time. 

But wait, how about the velocity of the particle? Because the mean path length would be velocity multiplied by lifetime. So the mean decay distance L would be L = v * τ. 

So putting it together, L = v * (ħ / Γ). 

Now I need to find v. But to find v, I probably need the energy and mass of the particle. The production energy is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving relativistically. 

Hmm, the energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). Let's compute that. But wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. 

Next, the velocity v can be found using γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So solving for v, we get v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(γ²)). Let's compute that. 

Wait, but calculating that might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, since gamma is large (about 6.667), the particle is moving at a speed very close to c. So perhaps we can approximate v ≈ c. But maybe I shouldn't approximate; let me see.

Alternatively, since gamma is E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. So 1/γ² is about 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - 0.0225) is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887. But wait, that's not too bad. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression for v.

Wait, another approach: the velocity can be expressed in terms of beta (β). Beta is v/c. And the relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So solving for beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666666... So 1/gamma² is (1/6.6667)^2 ≈ (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v is 0.9887 c.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * c. But when I plug into L = v * tau, I can write c in m/s, and tau in seconds.

Wait, let's get all the constants straight. ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and ħ is h/(2π). But I think in particle physics, ħ is often expressed in units of GeV·s. So yes, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So let's compute tau: ħ / Γ. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let's calculate that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau is approximately 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 2.056875e-24? Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: 6.582 /0.32 = let's compute it. 0.32 is 32e-2. So 6.582 / 0.32 = (6.582 * 100)/32 = 658.2 /32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. So tau is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 c. c is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So the decay length L is v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = Let's compute that.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24. 

Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16. 

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375,

0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.000 (wait, 0.966 * 2 is 1.932. 0.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.05508. So together 1.932 + 0.05508 = 1.98708. So total is 4.11375 + 1.98708 ≈ 6.1008.

So 6.1008e-16 meters? Hmm, looking at the options:

Options are:
A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m
B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m
C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m
D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, but none of the options match. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the velocity. Let me double-check. Gamma is 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666666... So beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(6.666667)^2 ). 6.666667 squared is 44.444444.

So 1/(44.444444) is approximately 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is let me compute with more precision. Maybe I approximated it as 0.9887, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). 

Well, 0.988 squared is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. 0.989^2 is (0.988+0.001)^2 = 0.976144 + 2*(0.988)(0.001) + (0.001)^2 = 0.976144 + 0.001976 + 0.000001 = 0.978121. So 0.989^2 = 0.978121. Our target is 0.9775, which is between 0.988^2 (0.976144) and 0.989^2 (0.978121).

Let me find x where x² = 0.9775. Let's say x is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

Compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526.

0.98 * 0.0087 = same as above.

0.0087^2 = 0.00007569.

Wait, perhaps a better way:

(0.9887)^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*(0.98)*(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2.

0.98² is 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.

0.0087^2 is approx 0.00007569.

Adding them up: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769. Oh, that's really close to 0.9775. So x is approximately 0.9887, so beta is 0.9887, so v is 0.9887 c.

So that part was correct. So my initial calculation for v was correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of L = v * tau. Let me recompute:

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply 2.966 by 2.056875.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

Calculating 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875: Let me compute 0.966 * 2 = 1.932, 0.966 * 0.056875 = let's see.

0.056875 is 56875e-6.

0.966 * 56875e-6 = let me compute 0.966 * 56875 = ?

Hmm, 56875 * 0.966:

Breakdown: 56875 * 0.9 = 51187.5, 56875 * 0.066 = ?

56875 * 0.06 = 3412.5. 56875 * 0.006= 341.25. So 3412.5 + 341.25 = 3753.75.

Total: 51187.5 + 3753.75 = 54941.25.

So 54941.25e-6 = 54.94125.

So 0.966 * 2.056875 = 1.932 + 0.054941 ≈ 1.986941.

So total 4.11375 + 1.986941 = 6.100691.

So 6.100691e-16 meters. Hmm, about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. The options are 5.02e-16, 4.06e-15, 5.02e-15, 4.06e-16.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation steps. Let me check the units again.

Wait, production energy is 8 GeV and mass is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... correct.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct.

Tau = hbar/(Gamma) = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, correct.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

So 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.

Which we computed as 6.10069e-16 m.

But none of the options match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic mean lifetime instead of just tau.

Wait, another approach: the decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta gamma. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, and the velocity is beta c. So L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, but wait, tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the decay distance is L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, wait, let me think. The lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So the decay occurs at a distance L = v * gamma tau. Because the particle is moving at velocity v for a time gamma tau.

So L = v * gamma tau.

But v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

But tau is hbar / Gamma, so putting it all together:

L = beta c gamma (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, another way to write this. Since gamma = E/(m c^2), and E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c², so gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6666667.

And beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ 0.9887.

So let's compute L = beta * c * gamma * (hbar / Gamma).

Let's plug in the numbers:

beta ≈ 0.9887.

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

gamma = 6.6666667.

hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6666667 * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV).

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

Compute the numerator: 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Denominator: 0.32 GeV.

So hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s, same as before.

So gamma * (hbar / Gamma) = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = approx 13.708e-24 s.

Wait, 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = let me compute 6 * 2.056875e-24 is 12.34125e-24, 0.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-24. So total is 13.7125e-24 s.

Now, beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s.

Multiply 2.9661e8 by 13.7125e-24.

2.9661e8 is 2.9661 * 1e8.

13.7125e-24 is 13.7125 * 1e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.9661 * 13.7125 ≈ let's compute that.

2.9661 * 10 = 29.661.

2.9661 * 3.7125 = let's compute 2.9661 *3 =8.8983, *0.7125= approx 2.107. So total 8.8983 +2.107=11.0053.

So total of 29.661 + 11.0053 =40.6663.

So 40.6663 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 40.6663e-16 m = 4.06663e-15 m.

Wait, 40.6663e-16 is 4.06663e-15 m. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close. So perhaps I should have calculated exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Let me recompute the exact steps.

Compute beta more accurately.

With gamma = 8/(1.2) = 6.666666666666667.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

1/gamma^2 = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2^2)/(8^2) ) = (1.44)/(64) )= 0.0225.

Wait wait, wait, 8/1.2 is 20/3 ≈6.6666666667. So 6.6666666667 squared is (20/3)^2=400/9≈44.444444444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400= 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 =0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approx 0.9887 as before.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator-like approach.

But maybe it's not necessary and the approximation is sufficient.

Wait, but in any case, the final calculation gave me about 4.066e-15 m, which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer must be option B or option D? Wait, no. Wait, option B is 4.0655e-15, option D is 4.0655e-16. So I have 4.066e-15, which matches option B.

So why did my initial approach give me around 6e-16 m? Because I forgot to multiply by gamma again. Oh! Because earlier I used tau as the proper lifetime, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, in the first approach, I multiplied v by tau, which is the proper lifetime, but in reality, the correct formula is L = v * gamma tau. So I forgot the gamma factor in the first calculation.

So in the first calculation, I only multiplied by tau, but the correct approach should have multiplied by gamma tau. So that's why the initial approach was wrong. The correct approach is to use the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

So the correct calculation is:

L = beta c gamma * (hbar / Gamma)

Which is what I did in the second approach, leading to 4.066e-15 m, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the particle in its rest frame, and \( v \) is the particle's velocity in the lab frame. The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation between energy, mass, and velocity. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E \) is the total energy of the particle, \( m \) is its rest mass, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The velocity \( v \) can then be expressed as:

\[
v = \beta c, \quad \text{where } \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The total energy \( E \) is \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and the mass \( m \) is \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{8}{1.2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 \approx 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{1}{44.4444} \approx 0.0225
\]

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, \( v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance in the lab frame is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau \cdot \gamma
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), and \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.6667
\]

First, calculate \( 2.966 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 6.1007 \). Then:

\[
L \approx 6.1007 \cdot 10^{-16} \cdot 6.6667 \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
