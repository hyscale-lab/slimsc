Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

Wait, right, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian depends on the fields and coupling constants involved. So each term's dimension has to be [Mass]^4 because the Lagrangian density has to have mass dimension 4 (since it's integrated over four dimensions to get an action, which is dimensionless).

So, let me break down each part of the Lagrangian. The fields involved are ψ (the Dirac spinor) and F^{μν} (the field strength tensor). Also, σ_{μν} is made from γ matrices, which are dimensionless since they're part of the Dirac algebra.

First, I need to find the mass dimensions of each field and the coupling. Let's list them out:

- Spinor ψ: I think the Dirac spinor has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the Dirac equation tells us ψ has dimension 3/2. Because the covariant derivative is ∂_μ which has dimension 1, and the term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ must be dimensionless in the equation (iγ ∂ ψ) = m ψ, so ψ has to have dimension 3/2.

- F^{μν}: The field strength tensor is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1 (since Maxwell's term is like F^2, so F has dimension 2? Wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the Maxwell Lagrangian is like F^2, so each F is dimension 2 because the Lagrangian density must be dimension 4. So F^μν has dimension 2 because (F)^2 would be dimension 4. So F is dimension 2.

So, F^{μν} has [F] = 2.

Now, looking at the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, each part's dimensions: ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

σ_{μν} is made from γ matrices, which are dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Then, ψ̄ σ ψ: each ψ is 3/2, so (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. And σ is 0, so the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is ψ̄ (σ_{μν}) ψ. So each ψ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless, so the product is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then, F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the entire term (without κ) is (3) * (2) = 5.

Wait, no, wait. The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each factor is:

ψ̄ → 3/2

σ → 0

ψ → 3/2

F → 2.

So the product is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3 for the ψ terms, and then times F's 2 gives 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian itself must have dimension 4 (since it's a Lagrangian density). So the entire term [κ ψ̄ σ ψ F] must have dimension 4.

So the dimension of the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is 3 (from ψ̄ and ψ) plus 2 (from F) → 5. So the term κ times that product must have dimension 4. So [κ] [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4 → [κ] * 5 = 4. So [κ] = 4/5.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 4/5. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the dimensions of F^{μν}. Let me double-check. The field strength F is defined as ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Since each ∂ has dimension 1, and A is a vector field with dimension 1 (since the Maxwell term is F_{μν}F^{μν}, which must have dimension 4 → F^2 → F is 2). Oh wait, no. Wait, F is a tensor with two indices, each of which can be thought of as a derivative acting on A, which is dimension 1. So each F_{μν} has dimension [∂ A] → [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So F has dimension 2.

So, the term ψ̄ σ ψ F is [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] = (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 → because σ is dimensionless. Wait, wait no. ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So product is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = (3) + 2 = 5. So the term without κ is dimension 5, and the Lagrangian term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F), which is dimension 4. So κ's dimension must be 4 - 5 = -1. So [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would match option A or C.

Now, the second part is about whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. In general, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has dimension ≤ (4 - (sum of fields' dimensions in each term)).

Wait, no, wait. For a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the dimension of g is d = 4 - (sum of dimensions of the fields in that term). But for a term to be renormalizable, d ≥ 0. So the coupling must have positive or zero dimension.

Wait, but for an interaction term, like L = g φ^3, the dimension of g is [g] = 4 - 3*(dimension of φ). If φ has dimension 1 (like in scalar φ^4 theory, dimension 1), then 4 - 3(1) = 1 ≥ 0, so renormalizable.

But in our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The sum of the fields' dimensions is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. So the coupling κ has dimension [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1. So the dimension is negative.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the Lagrangian term is κ times the product of the fields, so the dimension of the term is [κ] + sum of fields' dimensions. The entire term must be dimension 4. So [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = -1.

Hmm. Now, in terms of renormalizability, interactions with couplings of negative mass dimension are nonrenormalizable. Because each time you integrate out high momentum modes, the coupling's dimension affects the number of loops needed for renormalization. So if [g] >0, the theory is renormalizable because the coupling can be absorbed into the Lagrangian without higher-dimension terms. If [g] <0, it's nonrenormalizable because the coupling becomes stronger at higher energies (super-renormalizable?), or wait, wait.

Wait, correct: A coupling with positive mass dimension is super-renormalizable because the interaction term is more relevant. Wait, no, I think the opposite. Wait, the classification is based on the dimension. For a term with coupling g, if [g] = (4 - n), where n is the sum of fields in the term, then:

- If [g] > 0 → g has positive dimension → theory is super-renormalizable.

- If [g] = 0 → renormalizable.

- If [g] < 0 → non-renormalizable.

Because in the interaction term, each vertex would contribute a factor of g, and in perturbation theory, the number of loops relates to the energy scale. If g has negative dimension, each loop would introduce higher powers of energy, leading to divergences that can't be absorbed by the original coupling, requiring an infinite number of counterterms. So the theory is not renormalizable.

In our case, [κ] = -1 < 0 → the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and renormalizable. So the correct answer must be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The mass dimensions of the fields and coupling constant are as follows:

1. **Mass dimension of $\psi$**: The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$ in 4 spacetime dimensions.
2. **Mass dimension of $\bar{\psi}$**: The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same mass dimension as $\psi$, which is $\frac{3}{2}$.
3. **Mass dimension of $F^{\mu\nu}$**: The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $2$.
4. **Mass dimension of $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$**: Since $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices, its mass dimension is $0$.

The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]
The Lagrangian density must have a total mass dimension of $4$ to ensure the action is dimensionless. Therefore, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

Next, we determine whether the theory is renormalizable. A theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant satisfies $[\kappa] \geq 0$. In this case, $[\kappa] = -1 < 0$, which means the theory is **not renormalizable**. Interactions with negative mass dimension are nonrenormalizable because they require an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences at higher energies.

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While $[\kappa] = -1$, the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. $[\kappa] \neq 1$.
- **Option C**: Correct. $[\kappa] = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. $[\kappa] \neq 1$.
