Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and the energy they're accelerated to is crucial. The problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. 

So the nucleus is Li-6. I need to find the total energy it has when moving at 0.96c. I think relativistic energy comes into play here because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. 

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). 

Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 * c². 

Calculating 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. 

Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. 

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. 

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. 0.28 times 3.57 is about 1. So yes, gamma is roughly 3.5714. 

Now, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, that's 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 900 is 5400, and 6*38 is 228, so total 5628 MeV. Wait, 938 *6 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.628 GeV. Now, multiply by gamma to get the total energy. So 5.628 GeV * 3.5714 is approximately... Let me compute that. 

Breaking it down: 5 * 3.5714 is about 17.857, and 0.628 *3.5714 is approximately 2.232. So adding together gives about 20.089 GeV. Hmm, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 5.628 * 3.5714. Let's do 5 *3.5714 = 17.857, 0.628 *3.5714. Let's compute 0.6 *3.5714=2.14284, and 0.028 *3.5714≈0.099999. So total 2.14284 + 0.099999 ≈ 2.2428. So adding to 17.857: 17.857 +2.2428 = 20.0998 GeV, approximately 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, B is 23.069, A is 18.475, D is 21.419. So the closest is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate the gamma correctly? Let me double-check the gamma calculation. The speed is 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.5714. That part seems right.

Another thing: the rest mass calculation. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons each of mass about 938 MeV. So 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Yep, that's correct.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV ≈ let me compute this more accurately.

Calculating 5.628 * 3.5714:

Let me break down 3.5714 as 3 + 0.5 + 0.0714.

5.628 *3 =16.884

5.628 *0.5 =2.814

5.628 *0.0714: 5.628 *0.07 is about 0.394, 5.628 *0.0014≈0.00788. So total about 0.394 +0.00788=0.40188.

Adding all together: 16.884 +2.814 =19.698 +0.40188=20.09988 GeV ≈20.1 GeV.

Looking at options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20.1 GeV. So option C.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma calculation. Let me calculate gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Hmm, perhaps the exact value of the mass is more precise. Let me think about the mass of Li-6. The exact mass might be a little different because when you have multiple nucleons, binding energy might come into play. Wait, but in particle physics, when considering heavy ions, the rest mass is often approximated as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. So for a nucleus like Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each about 938 MeV. So 6 * 938 =5628 MeV, 5.628 GeV. If it's more precise, perhaps the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy (mass defect), but for the purpose of this problem, I think they expect us to use 938 MeV per nucleon. 

So, perhaps the calculation is correct. So the energy would be approximately 20.1 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me recalculate the gamma multiplied by m0c² again, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me do 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

5.628 *3.57142857.

Let me compute it as:

3.57142857 is 25/7 (since 25 ÷7 ≈3.57142857).

So 5.628 *25/7 = (5.628*25)/7.

5.628 *25: 5 *25=125, 0.628*25=15.7. So total 125+15.7=140.7.

Divide by 7: 140.7 ÷7 =20.1 GeV. So exactly 20.1 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Maybe I used an approximate value for gamma.

Wait, if I compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) exactly, perhaps the exact value would give a slightly higher gamma.

So let's compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = exactly 3.57142857.

So the calculation is precise. So 5.628 GeV *3.57142857 = ?

5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.5=2.814.

5.628 *0.07142857.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

So 5.628 * (1/14) = approximately 0.402.

So 16.884 +2.814=19.698 +0.402=20.1 GeV.

Hmm. So perhaps the exact calculation is 20.1 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Maybe I should check if the mass is more precisely known.

Wait, the actual mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So perhaps using more precise values would change the calculation.

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

Neutrons:3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total m0c² = (2814.816 +2818.695) MeV =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Ah, okay, so instead of 5.628 GeV, it's approximately 5.6335 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

I can compute this as:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511 = approximately let's compute 3.5714 *0.6=2.14284, 3.5714*0.033511≈0.1198.

So 2.14284 +0.1198=2.26264.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.26264 ≈20.11978 GeV.

So approximately 20.12 GeV. So looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.633511 exactly.

Using calculator method:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511 = Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.03 =0.1071428571, 3.57142857 *0.003511≈0.012538.

So 0.1071428571 +0.012538≈0.119680857.

So adding the two parts: 2.142857142 +0.119680857 =2.262537999.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.262537999 =20.11968085 GeV.

Rounding to four decimal places: 20.1197 GeV. So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the precise mass.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is actually about 5.639 GeV/c², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be using the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I recall that the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.01525 u *931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01525 *931.5 ≈14.193 MeV.

Total: 5589 +14.193=5603.193 MeV, which is 5.603193 GeV.

Wait, that's different from the sum of individual nucleons. Because when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum due to binding energy (mass defect). So the actual rest mass is about 5.603 GeV.

Hmm, so perhaps I should use the exact mass instead of the sum of individual nucleons. Then the calculation would be:

E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.603193 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.603193.

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.603193 =16.80958.

0.57142857 *5.603193.

0.5 *5.603193=2.8015965.

0.07142857 *5.603193≈0.4020.

So 2.8015965 +0.4020≈3.2036.

So total E is 16.80958 +3.2036 ≈20.01318 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.013 GeV. Hmm, but this doesn't match either of the options. Because option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually lower than the sum of the individual nucleons. So the rest mass m0 is about 5.603 GeV, as I calculated from the atomic mass. So why is my earlier calculation giving 20.013 GeV, which isn't one of the options?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between atomic mass and nuclear mass. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 includes electrons. A lithium atom has 3 electrons. But in the nucleus, we're considering just the nucleus, not the entire atom.

Ah, that's a crucial point. So perhaps I should calculate the mass of the bare nucleus, not the atom.

So, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 u. Each proton contributes 1.007276 u, each neutron about 1.008665 u. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the nuclear mass.

Alternatively, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus (without electrons) is approximately 5.01525 u? Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the electrons. Let me think.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01525 u, which includes the nucleus plus the electrons. Since a neutral Li atom has 3 electrons, each with a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So the total mass of the electrons is 3 *0.00054858 ≈0.0016457 u.

So the nuclear mass is atomic mass minus electron mass: 6.01525 u - 0.0016457 u = approximately 6.013604 u.

Wait, no, wait. The atomic mass includes the nucleus and the electrons. For a neutral atom, the mass is nucleus + electrons. So to get the nucleus mass, subtract the electrons.

So Li-6 nucleus mass is 6.01525 u - (3 *0.00054858 u) ≈6.01525 - 0.00164574=6.013604 u.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01525 u. The mass of 3 protons is 3 *1.007276 ≈3.021828 u. The mass of 3 neutrons is 3 *1.008665 ≈3.025995 u. So total protons and neutrons: 3.021828 +3.025995=6.047823 u.

But the actual nuclear mass is 6.013604 u. So the binding energy is 6.047823 -6.013604=0.034219 u. Which is about 31.2 MeV (since 1 u ≈931.5 MeV). So the nuclear mass is 6.013604 u, which is 6.013604 *931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.013604 *931.5 ≈12.685 MeV.

So total is 5589 +12.685=5601.685 MeV, which is 5.601685 GeV.

So the rest mass is approximately 5.6017 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.6017 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.6017.

Let me break it down.

3 *5.6017=16.8051.

0.57142857 *5.6017.

0.5 *5.6017=2.80085.

0.07142857 *5.6017≈0.07142857 *5=0.35714, 0.07142857 *0.6017≈0.043. So 0.35714 +0.043≈0.399.

So 0.5*5.6017=2.80085, plus 0.07142857*5.6017≈0.399.

So 2.80085 +0.399≈3.19985.

Adding to 16.8051: 16.8051 +3.19985≈20.00495 GeV.

So approximately 20.005 GeV. Hmm, that's about 20.00 GeV. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV and option D:21.419.

Wait, but this is conflicting with my earlier calculations. Maybe I'm getting the nuclear mass wrong.

Wait another approach: perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the binding energy and just sum the individual masses. So using 6 *938 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then E= gamma *5.628 GeV =3.57142857 *5.628.

Compute 3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628≈0.402.

So 2.814 +0.402=3.216.

Total E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Which is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is 6 *938 MeV =5.628 GeV, as the problem expects us to use that.

So in that case, the energy is 3.57142857 *5.628 =20.1 GeV, so option C is correct.

Wait, but in reality, the binding energy reduces the mass, but perhaps for this problem, they ignore that and use the sum of individual masses.

So I'll go with option C:20.132 GeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at a speed of \( 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of Li-6
Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate mass of a nucleon (\( 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 5628 \, \text{MeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Substitute \( \gamma \) and \( m_0 c^2 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking the calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.628 \approx 2.242 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.242 = 20.1 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. While more precise calculations or accounting for binding energy might slightly adjust the result, the problem likely assumes the sum of individual nucleon masses, leading to this answer.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and the energy they're accelerated to is crucial. The problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. 

So the nucleus is Li-6. I need to find the total energy it has when moving at 0.96c. I think relativistic energy comes into play here because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. 

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). 

Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 * c². 

Calculating 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. 

Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. 

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. 

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. 0.28 times 3.57 is about 1. So yes, gamma is roughly 3.5714. 

Now, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, that's 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 900 is 5400, and 6*38 is 228, so total 5628 MeV. Wait, 938 *6 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.628 GeV. Now, multiply by gamma to get the total energy. So 5.628 GeV * 3.5714 is approximately... Let me compute that. 

Breaking it down: 5 * 3.5714 is about 17.857, and 0.628 *3.5714 is approximately 2.232. So adding together gives about 20.089 GeV. Hmm, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 5.628 * 3.5714. Let's do 5 *3.5714 = 17.857, 0.628 *3.5714. Let's compute 0.6 *3.5714=2.14284, and 0.028 *3.5714≈0.099999. So total 2.14284 + 0.099999 ≈ 2.2428. So adding to 17.857: 17.857 +2.2428 = 20.0998 GeV, approximately 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, B is 23.069, A is 18.475, D is 21.419. So the closest is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate the gamma correctly? Let me double-check the gamma calculation. The speed is 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.5714. That part seems right.

Another thing: the rest mass calculation. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons each of mass about 938 MeV. So 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Yep, that's correct.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV ≈ let me compute this more accurately.

Calculating 5.628 * 3.5714:

Let me break down 3.5714 as 3 + 0.5 + 0.0714.

5.628 *3 =16.884

5.628 *0.5 =2.814

5.628 *0.0714: 5.628 *0.07 is about 0.394, 5.628 *0.0014≈0.00788. So total about 0.394 +0.00788=0.40188.

Adding all together: 16.884 +2.814 =19.698 +0.40188=20.09988 GeV ≈20.1 GeV.

Looking at options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20.1 GeV. So option C.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma calculation. Let me calculate gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Hmm, perhaps the exact value of the mass is more precise. Let me think about the mass of Li-6. The exact mass might be a little different because when you have multiple nucleons, binding energy might come into play. Wait, but in particle physics, when considering heavy ions, the rest mass is often approximated as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. So for a nucleus like Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each about 938 MeV. So 6 * 938 =5628 MeV, 5.628 GeV. If it's more precise, perhaps the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy (mass defect), but for the purpose of this problem, I think they expect us to use 938 MeV per nucleon. 

So, perhaps the calculation is correct. So the energy would be approximately 20.1 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me recalculate the gamma multiplied by m0c² again, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me do 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

5.628 *3.57142857.

Let me compute it as:

3.57142857 is 25/7 (since 25 ÷7 ≈3.57142857).

So 5.628 *25/7 = (5.628*25)/7.

5.628 *25: 5 *25=125, 0.628*25=15.7. So total 125+15.7=140.7.

Divide by 7: 140.7 ÷7 =20.1 GeV. So exactly 20.1 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Maybe I used an approximate value for gamma.

Wait, if I compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) exactly, perhaps the exact value would give a slightly higher gamma.

So let's compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = exactly 3.57142857.

So the calculation is precise. So 5.628 GeV *3.57142857 = ?

5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.5=2.814.

5.628 *0.07142857.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

So 5.628 * (1/14) = approximately 0.402.

So 16.884 +2.814=19.698 +0.402=20.1 GeV.

Hmm. So perhaps the exact calculation is 20.1 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Maybe I should check if the mass is more precisely known.

Wait, the actual mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So perhaps using more precise values would change the calculation.

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

Neutrons:3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total m0c² = (2814.816 +2818.695) MeV =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

Ah, okay, so instead of 5.628 GeV, it's approximately 5.6335 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

I can compute this as:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511 = approximately let's compute 3.5714 *0.6=2.14284, 3.5714*0.033511≈0.1198.

So 2.14284 +0.1198=2.26264.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.26264 ≈20.11978 GeV.

So approximately 20.12 GeV. So looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.633511 exactly.

Using calculator method:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511 = Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.03 =0.1071428571, 3.57142857 *0.003511≈0.012538.

So 0.1071428571 +0.012538≈0.119680857.

So adding the two parts: 2.142857142 +0.119680857 =2.262537999.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.262537999 =20.11968085 GeV.

Rounding to four decimal places: 20.1197 GeV. So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the precise mass.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is actually about 5.639 GeV/c², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be using the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I recall that the actual atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.01525 u *931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01525 *931.5 ≈14.193 MeV.

Total: 5589 +14.193=5603.193 MeV, which is 5.603193 GeV.

Wait, that's different from the sum of individual nucleons. Because when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum due to binding energy (mass defect). So the actual rest mass is about 5.603 GeV.

Hmm, so perhaps I should use the exact mass instead of the sum of individual nucleons. Then the calculation would be:

E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.603193 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.603193.

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.603193 =16.80958.

0.57142857 *5.603193.

0.5 *5.603193=2.8015965.

0.07142857 *5.603193≈0.4020.

So 2.8015965 +0.4020≈3.2036.

So total E is 16.80958 +3.2036 ≈20.01318 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.013 GeV. Hmm, but this doesn't match either of the options. Because option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually lower than the sum of the individual nucleons. So the rest mass m0 is about 5.603 GeV, as I calculated from the atomic mass. So why is my earlier calculation giving 20.013 GeV, which isn't one of the options?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between atomic mass and nuclear mass. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 includes electrons. A lithium atom has 3 electrons. But in the nucleus, we're considering just the nucleus, not the entire atom.

Ah, that's a crucial point. So perhaps I should calculate the mass of the bare nucleus, not the atom.

So, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01525 u. Each proton contributes 1.007276 u, each neutron about 1.008665 u. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the nuclear mass.

Alternatively, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus (without electrons) is approximately 5.01525 u? Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the electrons. Let me think.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01525 u, which includes the nucleus plus the electrons. Since a neutral Li atom has 3 electrons, each with a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So the total mass of the electrons is 3 *0.00054858 ≈0.0016457 u.

So the nuclear mass is atomic mass minus electron mass: 6.01525 u - 0.0016457 u = approximately 6.013604 u.

Wait, no, wait. The atomic mass includes the nucleus and the electrons. For a neutral atom, the mass is nucleus + electrons. So to get the nucleus mass, subtract the electrons.

So Li-6 nucleus mass is 6.01525 u - (3 *0.00054858 u) ≈6.01525 - 0.00164574=6.013604 u.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01525 u. The mass of 3 protons is 3 *1.007276 ≈3.021828 u. The mass of 3 neutrons is 3 *1.008665 ≈3.025995 u. So total protons and neutrons: 3.021828 +3.025995=6.047823 u.

But the actual nuclear mass is 6.013604 u. So the binding energy is 6.047823 -6.013604=0.034219 u. Which is about 31.2 MeV (since 1 u ≈931.5 MeV). So the nuclear mass is 6.013604 u, which is 6.013604 *931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.013604 *931.5 ≈12.685 MeV.

So total is 5589 +12.685=5601.685 MeV, which is 5.601685 GeV.

So the rest mass is approximately 5.6017 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.6017 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.6017.

Let me break it down.

3 *5.6017=16.8051.

0.57142857 *5.6017.

0.5 *5.6017=2.80085.

0.07142857 *5.6017≈0.07142857 *5=0.35714, 0.07142857 *0.6017≈0.043. So 0.35714 +0.043≈0.399.

So 0.5*5.6017=2.80085, plus 0.07142857*5.6017≈0.399.

So 2.80085 +0.399≈3.19985.

Adding to 16.8051: 16.8051 +3.19985≈20.00495 GeV.

So approximately 20.005 GeV. Hmm, that's about 20.00 GeV. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV and option D:21.419.

Wait, but this is conflicting with my earlier calculations. Maybe I'm getting the nuclear mass wrong.

Wait another approach: perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the binding energy and just sum the individual masses. So using 6 *938 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then E= gamma *5.628 GeV =3.57142857 *5.628.

Compute 3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628≈0.402.

So 2.814 +0.402=3.216.

Total E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Which is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is 6 *938 MeV =5.628 GeV, as the problem expects us to use that.

So in that case, the energy is 3.57142857 *5.628 =20.1 GeV, so option C is correct.

Wait, but in reality, the binding energy reduces the mass, but perhaps for this problem, they ignore that and use the sum of individual masses.

So I'll go with option C:20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at a speed of \( 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of Li-6
Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate mass of a nucleon (\( 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 5628 \, \text{MeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Substitute \( \gamma \) and \( m_0 c^2 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking the calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.628 \approx 2.242 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.242 = 20.1 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. While more precise calculations or accounting for binding energy might slightly adjust the result, the problem likely assumes the sum of individual nucleon masses, leading to this answer.

**Answer: C**
