Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question says that there are two electrons in p-orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. But wait, the state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait a minute. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2? Because when you couple two angular momenta with l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. Oh right, because l can be |l1-l2| up to l1+l2. So 2 is possible when both are aligned in the same direction.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>, which means the total l is 2 and m is -1. The problem is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ each. So each L_z gives m times ħ. Because L_z |l, m> = mħ |l, m>. 

Wait, each electron here is in a p orbital, so their individual l's are 1. So L1z for particle 1 would be m1 * ħ, and similarly for L2z. So in this state, the total m is -1. But the total m is m1 + m2. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question is, what's the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because if each has m=-1, then the sum would be -2. But the state has m=-1, which is different. So that's a problem.

Wait, the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. So the sum m1 + m2 = -1. If both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum would be -2. So that's not possible in this state. So can the system be in a state where m1=-1 and m2=-1? 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is about the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. So each L_z measures m_i * ħ, so for each to be -ħ, m1 and m2 must each be -1. So the sum would be m1 + m2 = -2. But the state has m = -1. So there's a conflict here.

Therefore, the probability of both being -ħ is zero because it would require the total m to be -2, which isn't compatible with the given state's m of -1.

Wait, but maybe I should think about how the coupled state is represented. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific state where the total angular momentum is 2, m=-1. But to find the possible m1 and m2 values that contribute to this state, I might need to look at the Clebsch-Gordan expansion or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a combination of different m1 and m2 values. But the question is about the probability of m1=-1 and m2=-1. Let's see.

The state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) are (-1,0), (0,-1), and maybe (-2,1) but wait, wait, m can't be more than l. Since each electron has l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

So possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

m1=-1, m2=0.

m1=0, m2=-1.

Is there another? What about m1=1, m2=-2? No, because m2 can't be less than -1. So only two possibilities: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, no, let me calculate m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1 is from -1 to 1. So let's list all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1:

m1=-1, m2=0.

m1=0, m2=-1.

m1=1, m2=-2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so that's not allowed. So only two terms.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of these two states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how? Because when you combine two angular momenta, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play. So perhaps the total state is a linear combination of these two basis states. So when you measure m1 and m2, each term contributes to the possible outcomes.

Therefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So what's the expansion? Let me think. The general formula for coupling two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get total l and m is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For l1=l2=1, and l=2, m=-1.

The state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible m1, m2 are (-1,0), (0,-1), and perhaps others, but in this case, only these two are allowed.

But wait, let me double-check. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into l=2. The state |l=2, m=-2> would be |1,1,2,-2>, which comes from |m1=-1, m2=-1>, but that's when m1 + m2 = -2. But our state is m=-1, so m1 + m2 =-1.

So, for m=-1, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this can be found, but perhaps for this problem, I don't need the exact coefficients. The key point is that the state is a combination of these two basis states, each of which has either m1=-1 and m2=0 or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So when the system is in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible outcomes for m1 and m2 are only these two possibilities. Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 would be zero, because that's not one of the terms in the expansion.

So the joint probability of getting m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero. Therefore, the answer should be 0, which is option D.

The problem involves two electrons in a p-orbital angular momentum state, with the coupled angular momentum state given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding $z$-component of the system, respectively. The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

For two electrons in this state, the total $m$ is given by $m = m_1 + m_2 = -1$. If both $m_1$ and $m_2$ were $-1$, their sum would be $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which is incompatible with the total $m = -1$ of the given state. Therefore, the scenario where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ cannot occur in this state.

To further confirm, the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of basis states $|m_1, m_2>$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. The pair $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ is not part of this expansion, as it would correspond to $m = -2$, which is inconsistent with the total $m = -1$ of the state.

Thus, the joint probability of measuring both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.
