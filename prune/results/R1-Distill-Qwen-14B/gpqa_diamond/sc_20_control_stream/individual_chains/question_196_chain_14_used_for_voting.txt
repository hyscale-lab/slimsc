Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's try to think this through.

The problem states that we have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given as A to D, each with a different formula.

Wait, in a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed v_max is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. And ω is sqrt(k/m). So in non-relativistic case, v_max² = (k/m) A². But since this is relativistic, I guess we have to consider the effects of special relativity, like how kinetic energy and momentum change when speeds get close to the speed of light, c.

So, in relativity, the kinetic energy K is not (1/2)mv², but rather (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the momentum p is γmv. So when the oscillator is moving, it's going to have relativistic momentum and energy.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) k x². At maximum displacement, x = A, so the potential energy is (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So in the non-relativistic case, the mechanical energy is (1/2) k A², and at x=0, the kinetic energy is that same value. But in the relativistic case, the energy isn't just kinetic, it's the total energy which includes rest mass energy.

Wait, but wait. The total mechanical energy of the oscillator would still be the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the total energy is different. Let me think.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2) k A², which is equal to the kinetic energy at the equilibrium. But in relativity, the maximum kinetic energy would be when all potential energy is converted to kinetic. But since the system's total energy includes rest mass energy, perhaps we have to set the total energy (which is conserved) to be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says it's a relativistic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So the potential is still (1/2)k x²? Or is there a relativistic correction to the potential? Hmm, the question says F = -k x, so the potential is still (1/2)k x². So the potential energy is (1/2)k x² as before.

At the maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)k A². But wait, in relativity, the total energy also includes the rest mass energy. Oh, right, so the total energy isn't just (1/2)k A²; that's just the mechanical energy. The total energy is mc² plus the mechanical energy?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A². When the mass is at x=0, all that energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)k A², giving v_max² = k A² / m.

But in the relativistic case, when the mass is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc². The potential energy at x=A is (1/2)k A², so the total energy is (1/2)k A² + mc².

Wait, no. Wait, the system's total energy includes the rest energy plus the mechanical energy. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Another approach: the system's total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy. Or perhaps the mechanical energy includes the rest energy. Hmm.

Wait, no. The rest energy is mc², which is the energy when the mass is at rest. The mechanical energy is the energy associated with the motion, so when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the mechanical energy is potential. So the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy would be mc² + (1/2)k A², but in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy comes from the mechanical energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: Let's think about the energy. At maximum displacement, x = A. The velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero in the relativistic sense. The potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential mechanical energy? Or is the total energy just the mechanical energy plus rest energy?

Wait, the rest energy is mc², which is a constant. The oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy of the system is mc² + (1/2)k A².

But when the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy equals the total energy minus the rest energy? Wait, no. Because when the mass is at x=0, its velocity is maximum, so the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc², and the potential is zero. So the total energy is (γ - 1) mc² + mc² = γ mc². But wait, this is equal to the total energy when the mass is at x=A, which is (1/2)k A² + mc².

Wait, that makes sense. So setting them equal:

γ mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

So, γ = [ (1/2)k A² + mc² ] / (mc² )

= 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, so γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write:

1 / sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c² ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]²

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as some term, say, (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = α.

So, 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

Let me rearrange:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - [ 1/(1 + α)^2 ]

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 ]

Substituting back α:

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ] )

Wait, looking at the options, option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ), which matches exactly what I have. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy setup. Let me think again. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and mechanical energy. So when x = A, E = mc² + (1/2)k A². When x=0, E = K.E. + mc²? Wait, no, because when x=0, the potential is zero, but the kinetic energy is (γ-1) mc². So total energy E is (γ-1) mc² + mc² = γ mc². So setting E from both cases:

γ mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

Which gives γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Same as before. So the steps I took earlier are correct, leading to option D.

But let me check the other options to see if any others might fit. Option C is v_max = sqrt(k A²/m). That's the non-relativistic case, so it's not the answer here.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 ). Hmm, that seems to involve terms without considering c, which is unlikely in a relativistic scenario. Also, the denominator has 1 - (k A²)/(2m), which would go singular if k A² / (2m) approaches 1. That seems problematic.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ), which also seems to have a denominator that could approach zero if (k A²)/(2 m c² ) approaches 1, but the expression inside the square root would then become very large. But from our previous derivation, the denominator inside the square root was (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2, so option B doesn't match.

Option D matches our derived formula. So I think the correct answer is D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system's energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system is conserved and includes the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the mechanical energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the mechanical energy is potential energy, given by \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]

   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. In relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The total energy at \( x = 0 \) is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2
   \]

   Equating the two expressions for \( E_{\text{total}} \):  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Divide through by \( mc^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Squaring Both Sides**:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]

   Rearranging:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]

   Solving for \( v^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2 = c^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}\right)
   \]

   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
