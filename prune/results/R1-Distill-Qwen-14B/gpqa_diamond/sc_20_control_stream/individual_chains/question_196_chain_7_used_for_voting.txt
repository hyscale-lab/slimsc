Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, but since it's relativistic, I can't just use the classical equations. I must remember that relativistic effects come into play, probably involving the Lorentz factor or something like that.

In the classical case (non-relativistic), the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's one of the options here, option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so option C might not be the correct one.

I remember that in special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², but becomes (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its kinetic and potential energies, but both might be expressed relativistically.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, I'm not sure if that changes. Maybe in this problem, they're using the classical potential energy but incorporating relativistic effects elsewhere.

So the total mechanical energy E of the oscillator is the sum of the potential and kinetic at any point. At maximum displacement (x = A), the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is purely potential: E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, wait. In the relativistic case, the total energy might be different. Let me think: in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², and at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so KE = (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max as sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is relativistic, the energies must be treated with gamma.

Wait, so at x=0, the potential energy is zero (classically), so the total energy (E) would be entirely kinetic, but relativistic. So E = gamma mc². But wait, the total energy in the system could be the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. So perhaps at x=A, the potential energy is maximal, and kinetic is zero. Wait, but in relativity, the potential energy might be treated differently.

Wait, maybe the approach is to write the conservation of energy. Let me set up the equations.

The total energy E is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy. So,

E = gamma mc² + (1/2)kx².

At maximum x (x=A), the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is just the rest energy (mc²) plus the potential energy (1/2 kA²). Wait, no, because gamma is greater than or equal to 1. So:

At x = A, E = mc² * gamma(A) + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, that's if the potential energy is (1/2)kx², which is the classical case. But in reality, in relativity, the potential might be different, but perhaps the problem assumes that the potential is still (1/2)kx². So let's go with that.

Wait, but the total energy E must be same at all points. So at x=0, the potential is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So E = K.E. + 0 = (gamma - 1) mc².

At x = A, E = potential energy + K.E. At x=A, K.E. is zero (velocity zero?), so E = (1/2)kA² + mc² * gamma(A). Wait no, gamma(A) is because the mass has potential energy at x=A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the energy conservation equation.

At x = A (maximum displacement), velocity v = 0. The total energy E is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy at that point.

Potential energy U = (1/2)kA².

Kinetic energy K = 0, because v=0. So E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, that's the same as the classical case. But that can't be right in relativity, because the relativistic energy includes rest energy.

Wait, I'm making a mistake. The total energy in relativity is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So at x=A, the particle is at rest (v=0), so the total energy would be (gamma) mc² = (1) mc². But that's only if the potential energy is zero. But in reality, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the total energy E must be that plus the rest energy?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The total energy is the sum of the particle's energy and the potential energy. So,

E = (gamma) mc² + (1/2)k x².

At x = A, v=0, so gamma is 1.

So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But from the other point, at x=0, the particle has maximum velocity. The potential energy is zero, so E is the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest energy.

Wait, wait. At x=0, the velocity is maximum, so kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

So at x=0, E = (gamma - 1) mc² + 0 = (gamma) mc² - mc².

But wait, from x=A, E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At x=0, E is (gamma) mc² - mc². So, equating the two expressions for E:

mc² + (1/2)k A² = (gamma mc²) - mc².

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I set them equal,

mc² + (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me write E as the sum of kinetic and potential.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc^2, which includes the rest energy. So the potential energy is a separate term. But does that make sense? Or perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy?

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as the total energy E is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

So the total energy is:

E = (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

At x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so E = 0 + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that would imply E = (1/2)k A², which is same as non-relativistic. But that can't be correct, because when E is (1/2)k A², and at x=0, E would be (gamma-1) mc², since potential is zero. So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

But that would give v_max in terms of (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but wait, the velocity at x=0 is v_max, so gamma here would be the gamma at that point. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, because (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me re-express that.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So let me write this as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 1/gamma² = 1 - v²/c² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So, v_max² = c² (1 - 1/gamma²).

Substituting gamma from above,

gamma = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ] → wait, no, that's not the way. Let me think.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²).

Wait, but in any case, let me compute 1/gamma².

1/gamma² = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]².

So,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ].

Hmm, looking at the options, which one fits this form?

Looking at option D:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) )

Wait, no.

Wait, let me compute the expression again:

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(gamma^2) ]

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So,

1/gamma^2 = [ (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Hmm, but that might not be the easiest way to approach it. Alternatively, perhaps I can express 1/gamma^2 as [ 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) ]

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ]

= c² [ ( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Expanding the numerator: (1 + x)^2 - 1 = 2x + x^2, where x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max^2 = c² [ ( 2x + x² ) / (1 + x )^2 ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this matches any of the given options. Let me check the options.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let's see option A:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) ) )

Hmm, but in our expression, the denominator is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to start by considering the energy. The total mechanical energy E is the same at all points.

At x=A, v=0.

E = (gamma) mc^2 + (1/2) k A^2.

Wait, no, wait: in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², and the potential is (1/2) k x². So,

E = (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2) k x².

At x=A, v=0, so gamma is 1, so E = 0 + (1/2)k A².

At x=0, E = (gamma -1) mc^2 + 0.

So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which brings us back to the same expression as before.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)}.

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Let me compute 1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma^2) → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

But substituting gamma from above,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/[ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ].

Hmm, and that's what we had earlier.

Wait, looking again at the options, which one matches this.

Looking at option D:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

Which is exactly what our expression is.

Wait, because our expression is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)), and gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2), so 1/gamma^2 is 1/( (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 ), so yes.

So, option D looks correct.

Wait, but let me double-check with the options.

Option D is: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2mc²) )^2 ) )

Wait, no, I think I misread it. Let me see:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²) ))^2 )

Wait, no. The denominator inside is (1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2) ))^2, but the option has 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) squared, but in the denominator of the fraction inside the sqrt.

Wait, option D says: sqrt(1 - [1/( (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²) ))^2 ) ] )

But according to our calculation, v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2) ) )^2 ) ]

So yes, that would give v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 mc²) ))^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the initial setup. Because in relativity, the expression for the potential energy might not be the same as classical. Hmm, but the problem states that it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, which is the same as the classical case. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx².

So, our setup should be correct.

So, the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but wait, another approach: maybe the energy E is simply the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. Because in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) mc², and the total energy E would be the sum of rest energy and potential.

So,

E = gamma mc² = (1/2) k A^2 + mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is the same as before.

So, same conclusion, leading to option D.

So, the answer should be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we must account for relativistic effects. The total energy \( E \) of the system is conserved and includes both the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical potential energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy \( E \) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy:
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **At Maximum Displacement (\( x = A \))**:  
   At \( x = A \), the velocity \( v = 0 \), so the total energy is purely potential:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

3. **At Equilibrium (\( x = 0 \))**:  
   At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum (\( v = v_{\text{max}} \)), and the total energy is purely relativistic kinetic energy:
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]

4. **Equating Energies**:  
   Since the total energy is conserved, equate the two expressions for \( E \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

5. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2} \right).
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}} \)  
  This does not match the derived expression because the denominator inside the square root is incorrect.

- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the denominator is not squared, and the expression inside the square root is inconsistent with the derived result.

- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
  This is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects, so it is incorrect.

- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}} \)  
  This matches the derived expression exactly.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**.
