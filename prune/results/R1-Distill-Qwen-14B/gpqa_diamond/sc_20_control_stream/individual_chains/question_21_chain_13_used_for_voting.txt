Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about isomerism and tautomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and adjacent atom between two groups, like keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, there needs to be a structure where a hydrogen can move, causing a change in the arrangement of atoms, especially involving double bonds.

Benzoquinone... I remember that quinones have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone specifically is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups. Wait, are those in para positions? If a compound has two ketone groups in positions that allow them to be conjugated, maybe they can't tautomerize? Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no—tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen and a double bond change. Benzoquinone, being fully conjugated, perhaps doesn't have any enol form. Because in the enol form, you have a double bond and an -OH. But benzoquinone is already a diketone, so maybe it can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent hydrogen to shift. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Tautomerism requires the presence of both an acidic proton (like alpha to a carbonyl) and a hydrogen that can shift. For example, in a diketone, maybe the protons alpha to the carbonyl groups are in positions that don't allow tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Hmm. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, right? So positions 1,3,5 are all carbonyls. That's a completely conjugated structure. Because all the positions are alternating single and double bonds. Wait, but the ring would have alternating double bonds, making it a conjugated system. So, does this structure allow for tautomerism? Well, in a trione, the carbonyl groups are at every other position, so maybe each has alpha hydrogens. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have each ketone group next to CH2 groups. So each ketone has two alpha hydrogens attached to the adjacent carbons.

So for each ketone, like in position 1, the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6) have two hydrogen each. But wait, the ring is 1,3,5-trione, so positions 2,4,6 are CH2 groups. So each of these positions has two hydrogens. So, in such a structure, each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl. Because each CH2 is next to a carbonyl group. So, maybe these can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, wait—tautomerism usually requires at least two hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. So in this case, each CH2 has two H's. So can the structure undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but when you have multiple adjacent carbonyl groups, maybe the movement isn't possible. Because if you have a conjugated system, perhaps the movement of a hydrogen isn't feasible. Alternatively, in a fully conjugated system, maybe the necessary conditions for tautomerism are not met.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, benzoquinone is para-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Each ketone is at position 1 and 4 (or 2 and 5, depending on numbering). So the adjacent carbons to the carbonyl groups (like positions 2 and 6 for the 1-ketone) each have a hydrogen. So, the alpha positions are each CH. So each has one hydrogen. So, maybe not enough for tautomerism? Or maybe because there are two ketone groups, the possibility of conjugate tautomerism exists.

Wait, but tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen from one position to another, which changes the structure between keto and enol forms. But in benzoquinone, if there's only one hydrogen on each side, maybe they can't form enol because you need at least two hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group to form a double bond. Wait, no, enol formation requires the alpha carbon to have at least one hydrogen. So, perhaps benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about examples. For instance, cyclohexanone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it has alpha hydrogens. But what about 1,3-cyclohexanedione? That has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, but wait, actually, 1,3-cyclohexanedione would have two ketones separated by one carbon. So that carbon (position 2) would have two alpha hydrogens. So that should allow for enol formation. Similarly, in 1,3,5-cyclohexane-trione, each of the CH2 groups between the ketones has two alpha hydrogens. So perhaps they can tautomerize.

Wait, but wait. Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Benzoquinone is a six-membered ring of benzene with two ketone groups. So the structure would be O=C6H4=O, but how? No, wait, benzene has three double bonds, and quinone has two keto groups. So, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, making it para. So, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6 for the first ketone) have one hydrogen each. Because the benzene ring in para-benzoquinone is fully conjugated, with two double bonds. So each of these adjacent carbons (like position 2) is a CH group. Thus, they have only one hydrogen. So, in such a case, each alpha position has only one hydrogen.

In order for a compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha carbon must have at least one hydrogen. Because when the hydrogen moves, a double bond forms. So, in the case of each CH group, there's only one hydrogen, which would allow for tautomerism. So, for benzoquinone, each alpha carbon has one hydrogen, so perhaps tautomerism is possible. But wait, but in the enol form, you need a hydrogen to move, creating a double bond. But the ring is already conjugated with double bonds. So perhaps the tautomerism isn't possible because the movement would disrupt the conjugation. Or maybe it can.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, because the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So each of the carbons adjacent to a carbonyl has two hydrogens. So they have alpha hydrogens, so they can tautomerize. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is which one does NOT show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone can't, then A would be benzoquinone. Otherwise, if both can, then perhaps one of them can't.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the structure is such that the keto group is part of an aromatic system, making any enol form unstable or not feasible. Because if the enol form would disrupt the aromaticity, then tautomerism wouldn't occur. So benzoquinone, being an aromatic compound, doesn't undergo enolization because the enol would not be aromatic. Hmm, that makes sense. Because adding a hydrogen and a double bond might break the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait. In para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. The ring is not fully conjugated as a benzene ring. Oh wait, no, quinones are non-aromatic. Because in the para-benzoquinone, the structure has two ketone groups opposite each other, and the ring has two double bonds. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Quinone is similar but with two of the double bonds replaced by carbonyl groups. So the ring in benzoquinone would have two double bonds and two ketone groups, but the ring isn't fully conjugated as a benzene ring. So, perhaps the structure is non-aromatic, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism.

Hmm, getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Which of these two compounds is less likely to undergo tautomerism. Benzoquinone is more likely to be in a stable form, perhaps due to being a conjugated system. If it's a conjugated diketone, maybe the enol form isn't very stable, so tautomerism doesn't occur. Alternatively, maybe it can, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I've read before that quinones are known for their enol tautomerism. Wait, perhaps they do exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. So that would mean that benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, so the one that doesn't is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure of the three trione. 1,3,5-trione: each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. So each alpha carbon (the CH2) has two hydrogens. So each can lose a hydrogen to form an enol. So this would allow for tautomerism.

But wait, the 1,3,5-trione is a fully conjugated system. So when it undergoes tautomerism, perhaps it can form multiple enol forms. But wait, if the compound is symmetric, maybe the enol forms are the same, so tautomerism might not be possible because the structure doesn't change. Wait, but 1,3,5-trione is symmetric; the molecule is symmetric across the ring, so any tautomer would lead to a structure that's the same as another due to symmetry. So maybe it doesn't show tautomerism because any enol form is identical to another, so no distinguishable tautomer exists. Hmm, that's an interesting point.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: if the molecule is symmetric, each possible enol form would be the same as another due to symmetry, so perhaps the tautomerism isn't observed because the enol form isn't different from the keto form in a way that's noticeable. So, in such a case, the compound might not show tautomerism because the enol form is just an identical structure due to symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe not. Because even if the molecule is symmetric, the enol form would have a different structure from the keto form. So it could still undergo tautomerism, but perhaps only in specific conditions.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this, so perhaps I'll move on to part B and come back.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, compounds without chiral centers might still have other forms of chirality, like in allenes or certain other structures.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Let me see. The hydroxy group is on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the ester group. The structure would be something like O

So, the carbon chain is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have -CH(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Looking for chiral centers: the hydroxy is on the second carbon. The second carbon has four different groups: a CH3 (from the first carbon), a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group (from the ester), and another CH2 (wait, no). Let me count the substituents.

Wait, the second carbon: attached groups are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon, which is a methyl group)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and a hydrogen? Or another group?

Wait, wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the propanoate part is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the second carbon (from the left) is CH(OH), connected to CH3 on the left, and COOCH3 on the right. So the groups attached to the second carbon are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (ester)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Because the second carbon is CH(OH) connected to the first (CH2) and the third (COOCH3). So the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate has three carbons. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3 (since it's propanoate)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, numbering from the COOH group, it's:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOH

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2, which is the middle CH2. So, structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOH. The ester would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Looking for chiral centers: the second carbon has CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- a hydrogen (since the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3)
- and another group? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon structure is:

Carbon 2: attached groups are:
- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- OH
- H

So four different substituents? Wait, CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes, the second carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. It has the structure HOOC-CHCH-COOH, but in fumarate, the two double bonds are in a trans configuration. The ester would be dimethyl fumarate: CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be (CH2COOCH3)CH=CH(CH2COOCH3). Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. But wait, that's not correct. Let me get the structure right.

Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the second and third carbons, and the substituents on each end of the double bond are both COOH groups. So, the dimethyl ester would have both COOH converted to COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would have the two ester groups on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, no. Wait, fumarate is (Z) or (E)? No, wait: maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric is the trans. So, in the ester, the groups on either end of the double bond are COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides?

Wait, for fumarate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are trans. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's see. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3. The central CH=CH has substituents on each end. Wait, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 group and two other substituents. Wait, the four substituents around each CH in the double bond are: COOCH3, H, the other CH, and another H. So, each carbon in the CH=CH group has two H's, a COOCH3, and the other CH.

Wait, so each of these CH's has two H's. So, the two CH=CH carbons are each attached to two H's, one COOCH3, and the other CH. So, each of these carbons has two identical groups (the H's). So, they don't have four different substituents, so they are not chiral centers.

But wait, maybe the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the groups on either end of the double bond are mirror images, then the molecule may not be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry or a plane that makes it achiral.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans diastereomer of the ester, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral overall, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, wait. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3 with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, going back to part B. The question is, which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't. So, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, wait. I'm confused again. Because dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. Could it have a different kind of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism? But the question is about optical isomerism, which refers to chiral centers.

So, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, let's go back to part A. Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone can't and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can, then A is benzoquinone. Or the other way around.

Wait, perhaps in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is such that the enol form is not possible because the ring is already conjugated. Alternatively, I've read that 1,3,5-tricyclohexatriene-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system and can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. However, because it's a fully conjugated system, the enol form would have different stability, but the tautomerism would still happen.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think of specific examples. For instance, para-quinones might not have tautomerism because the positions of the carbonyl groups don't allow for hydrogen movement without disrupting the structure. Alternatively, perhaps both can undergo tautomerism, but the question is which doesn't.

Alternatively, another approach: compounds that do not have alpha hydrogens cannot undergo tautomerism. So, which of the two has no alpha hydrogens.

Benzoquinone has the structure O=C6H4=O. Each carbon adjacent to the carbonyl has one hydrogen (CH groups). So, each alpha position has one hydrogen. So, alpha hydrogens are present.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each alpha position (adjacent to carbonyl) has CH2 groups, which have two hydrogens each. So, it has alpha hydrogens.

So both have alpha hydrogens, so both can undergo tautomerism. Then why is the question asking which doesn't?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the compounds.

Wait, benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. Each alpha position (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) has one hydrogen.

But in the case of a cyclic diketone like 1,3-cyclohexanedione, tautomerism is possible. So, perhaps benzoquinone also can. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the enol form is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have tautomerism because the enol form is not possible due to steric hindrance or other reasons.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is so conjugated that the enol form is not stabilized, making tautomerism not favorable. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps I can look for an alternative line of reasoning. Among the two, which one is more likely to be non-tautomerizing.

Wait, I remember that in cyclic ketones, especially those that are fully conjugated, tautomerism is not possible because the necessary hydrogen isn't available. Wait, but in 1,3,5-trione, the alpha positions have two H's, so they should be able to tautomerize.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone, being a conjugated diketone, doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no. Each carbonyl is adjacent to CH groups, which have one hydrogen each.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that if a compound can undergo tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha hydrogen. Both compounds have alpha hydrogens, so both can tautomerize. But the question is asking which doesn't.

Wait, perhaps another possibility: benzoquinone is an aromatic compound, and tautomerism would break the aromaticity, so it doesn't happen. So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize.

So, in that case, the answer to part A would be benzoquinone, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Putting it together:

A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. No, because B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Yes, that matches.

Wait, option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism. So in part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's correct according to our analysis.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the rearrangement of double bonds, typically requiring alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound is a six-membered aromatic ring with two ketone groups in para positions. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (alpha carbons) are CH groups, each with one hydrogen. However, benzoquinone is part of an aromatic system, and tautomerism would disrupt the aromaticity. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (alpha carbons) are CH2 groups, each with two hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerism, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry along the double bond. The carbons in the CH=CH group are not chiral centers, as they are bonded to identical groups. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
Combining the results from both parts:
- **A = benzoquinone**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about isomerism and tautomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and adjacent atom between two groups, like keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, there needs to be a structure where a hydrogen can move, causing a change in the arrangement of atoms, especially involving double bonds.

Benzoquinone... I remember that quinones have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone specifically is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups. Wait, are those in para positions? If a compound has two ketone groups in positions that allow them to be conjugated, maybe they can't tautomerize? Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no—tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen and a double bond change. Benzoquinone, being fully conjugated, perhaps doesn't have any enol form. Because in the enol form, you have a double bond and an -OH. But benzoquinone is already a diketone, so maybe it can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent hydrogen to shift. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Tautomerism requires the presence of both an acidic proton (like alpha to a carbonyl) and a hydrogen that can shift. For example, in a diketone, maybe the protons alpha to the carbonyl groups are in positions that don't allow tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Hmm. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, right? So positions 1,3,5 are all carbonyls. That's a completely conjugated structure. Because all the positions are alternating single and double bonds. Wait, but the ring would have alternating double bonds, making it a conjugated system. So, does this structure allow for tautomerism? Well, in a trione, the carbonyl groups are at every other position, so maybe each has alpha hydrogens. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have each ketone group next to CH2 groups. So each ketone has two alpha hydrogens attached to the adjacent carbons.

So for each ketone, like in position 1, the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6) have two hydrogen each. But wait, the ring is 1,3,5-trione, so positions 2,4,6 are CH2 groups. So each of these positions has two hydrogens. So, in such a structure, each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl. Because each CH2 is next to a carbonyl group. So, maybe these can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, wait—tautomerism usually requires at least two hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. So in this case, each CH2 has two H's. So can the structure undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but when you have multiple adjacent carbonyl groups, maybe the movement isn't possible. Because if you have a conjugated system, perhaps the movement of a hydrogen isn't feasible. Alternatively, in a fully conjugated system, maybe the necessary conditions for tautomerism are not met.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, benzoquinone is para-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Each ketone is at position 1 and 4 (or 2 and 5, depending on numbering). So the adjacent carbons to the carbonyl groups (like positions 2 and 6 for the 1-ketone) each have a hydrogen. So, the alpha positions are each CH. So each has one hydrogen. So, maybe not enough for tautomerism? Or maybe because there are two ketone groups, the possibility of conjugate tautomerism exists.

Wait, but tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen from one position to another, which changes the structure between keto and enol forms. But in benzoquinone, if there's only one hydrogen on each side, maybe they can't form enol because you need at least two hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group to form a double bond. Wait, no, enol formation requires the alpha carbon to have at least one hydrogen. So, perhaps benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about examples. For instance, cyclohexanone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it has alpha hydrogens. But what about 1,3-cyclohexanedione? That has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, but wait, actually, 1,3-cyclohexanedione would have two ketones separated by one carbon. So that carbon (position 2) would have two alpha hydrogens. So that should allow for enol formation. Similarly, in 1,3,5-cyclohexane-trione, each of the CH2 groups between the ketones has two alpha hydrogens. So perhaps they can tautomerize.

Wait, but wait. Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Benzoquinone is a six-membered ring of benzene with two ketone groups. So the structure would be O=C6H4=O, but how? No, wait, benzene has three double bonds, and quinone has two keto groups. So, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, making it para. So, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6 for the first ketone) have one hydrogen each. Because the benzene ring in para-benzoquinone is fully conjugated, with two double bonds. So each of these adjacent carbons (like position 2) is a CH group. Thus, they have only one hydrogen. So, in such a case, each alpha position has only one hydrogen.

In order for a compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha carbon must have at least one hydrogen. Because when the hydrogen moves, a double bond forms. So, in the case of each CH group, there's only one hydrogen, which would allow for tautomerism. So, for benzoquinone, each alpha carbon has one hydrogen, so perhaps tautomerism is possible. But wait, but in the enol form, you need a hydrogen to move, creating a double bond. But the ring is already conjugated with double bonds. So perhaps the tautomerism isn't possible because the movement would disrupt the conjugation. Or maybe it can.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, because the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So each of the carbons adjacent to a carbonyl has two hydrogens. So they have alpha hydrogens, so they can tautomerize. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is which one does NOT show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone can't, then A would be benzoquinone. Otherwise, if both can, then perhaps one of them can't.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the structure is such that the keto group is part of an aromatic system, making any enol form unstable or not feasible. Because if the enol form would disrupt the aromaticity, then tautomerism wouldn't occur. So benzoquinone, being an aromatic compound, doesn't undergo enolization because the enol would not be aromatic. Hmm, that makes sense. Because adding a hydrogen and a double bond might break the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait. In para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. The ring is not fully conjugated as a benzene ring. Oh wait, no, quinones are non-aromatic. Because in the para-benzoquinone, the structure has two ketone groups opposite each other, and the ring has two double bonds. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Quinone is similar but with two of the double bonds replaced by carbonyl groups. So the ring in benzoquinone would have two double bonds and two ketone groups, but the ring isn't fully conjugated as a benzene ring. So, perhaps the structure is non-aromatic, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism.

Hmm, getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Which of these two compounds is less likely to undergo tautomerism. Benzoquinone is more likely to be in a stable form, perhaps due to being a conjugated system. If it's a conjugated diketone, maybe the enol form isn't very stable, so tautomerism doesn't occur. Alternatively, maybe it can, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I've read before that quinones are known for their enol tautomerism. Wait, perhaps they do exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. So that would mean that benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, so the one that doesn't is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure of the three trione. 1,3,5-trione: each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. So each alpha carbon (the CH2) has two hydrogens. So each can lose a hydrogen to form an enol. So this would allow for tautomerism.

But wait, the 1,3,5-trione is a fully conjugated system. So when it undergoes tautomerism, perhaps it can form multiple enol forms. But wait, if the compound is symmetric, maybe the enol forms are the same, so tautomerism might not be possible because the structure doesn't change. Wait, but 1,3,5-trione is symmetric; the molecule is symmetric across the ring, so any tautomer would lead to a structure that's the same as another due to symmetry. So maybe it doesn't show tautomerism because any enol form is identical to another, so no distinguishable tautomer exists. Hmm, that's an interesting point.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: if the molecule is symmetric, each possible enol form would be the same as another due to symmetry, so perhaps the tautomerism isn't observed because the enol form isn't different from the keto form in a way that's noticeable. So, in such a case, the compound might not show tautomerism because the enol form is just an identical structure due to symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe not. Because even if the molecule is symmetric, the enol form would have a different structure from the keto form. So it could still undergo tautomerism, but perhaps only in specific conditions.

I'm getting a bit stuck on this, so perhaps I'll move on to part B and come back.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, compounds without chiral centers might still have other forms of chirality, like in allenes or certain other structures.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Let me see. The hydroxy group is on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the ester group. The structure would be something like O

So, the carbon chain is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have -CH(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Looking for chiral centers: the hydroxy is on the second carbon. The second carbon has four different groups: a CH3 (from the first carbon), a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl group (from the ester), and another CH2 (wait, no). Let me count the substituents.

Wait, the second carbon: attached groups are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon, which is a methyl group)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and a hydrogen? Or another group?

Wait, wait, the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the propanoate part is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the second carbon (from the left) is CH(OH), connected to CH3 on the left, and COOCH3 on the right. So the groups attached to the second carbon are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (ester)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Because the second carbon is CH(OH) connected to the first (CH2) and the third (COOCH3). So the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate has three carbons. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3 (since it's propanoate)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, numbering from the COOH group, it's:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOH

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on carbon 2, which is the middle CH2. So, structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOH. The ester would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Looking for chiral centers: the second carbon has CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- a hydrogen (since the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3)
- and another group? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon structure is:

Carbon 2: attached groups are:
- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- OH
- H

So four different substituents? Wait, CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So yes, the second carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. It has the structure HOOC-CHCH-COOH, but in fumarate, the two double bonds are in a trans configuration. The ester would be dimethyl fumarate: CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be (CH2COOCH3)CH=CH(CH2COOCH3). Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not possible. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. But wait, that's not correct. Let me get the structure right.

Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the second and third carbons, and the substituents on each end of the double bond are both COOH groups. So, the dimethyl ester would have both COOH converted to COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would have the two ester groups on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, no. Wait, fumarate is (Z) or (E)? No, wait: maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric is the trans. So, in the ester, the groups on either end of the double bond are COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides?

Wait, for fumarate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are trans. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's see. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3. The central CH=CH has substituents on each end. Wait, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 group and two other substituents. Wait, the four substituents around each CH in the double bond are: COOCH3, H, the other CH, and another H. So, each carbon in the CH=CH group has two H's, a COOCH3, and the other CH.

Wait, so each of these CH's has two H's. So, the two CH=CH carbons are each attached to two H's, one COOCH3, and the other CH. So, each of these carbons has two identical groups (the H's). So, they don't have four different substituents, so they are not chiral centers.

But wait, maybe the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the groups on either end of the double bond are mirror images, then the molecule may not be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry or a plane that makes it achiral.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans diastereomer of the ester, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral overall, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, wait. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3 with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, going back to part B. The question is, which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't. So, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, wait. I'm confused again. Because dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. Could it have a different kind of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism? But the question is about optical isomerism, which refers to chiral centers.

So, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, let's go back to part A. Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone can't and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can, then A is benzoquinone. Or the other way around.

Wait, perhaps in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is such that the enol form is not possible because the ring is already conjugated. Alternatively, I've read that 1,3,5-tricyclohexatriene-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system and can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. However, because it's a fully conjugated system, the enol form would have different stability, but the tautomerism would still happen.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think of specific examples. For instance, para-quinones might not have tautomerism because the positions of the carbonyl groups don't allow for hydrogen movement without disrupting the structure. Alternatively, perhaps both can undergo tautomerism, but the question is which doesn't.

Alternatively, another approach: compounds that do not have alpha hydrogens cannot undergo tautomerism. So, which of the two has no alpha hydrogens.

Benzoquinone has the structure O=C6H4=O. Each carbon adjacent to the carbonyl has one hydrogen (CH groups). So, each alpha position has one hydrogen. So, alpha hydrogens are present.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each alpha position (adjacent to carbonyl) has CH2 groups, which have two hydrogens each. So, it has alpha hydrogens.

So both have alpha hydrogens, so both can undergo tautomerism. Then why is the question asking which doesn't?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the compounds.

Wait, benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. Each alpha position (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) has one hydrogen.

But in the case of a cyclic diketone like 1,3-cyclohexanedione, tautomerism is possible. So, perhaps benzoquinone also can. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the enol form is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have tautomerism because the enol form is not possible due to steric hindrance or other reasons.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is so conjugated that the enol form is not stabilized, making tautomerism not favorable. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps I can look for an alternative line of reasoning. Among the two, which one is more likely to be non-tautomerizing.

Wait, I remember that in cyclic ketones, especially those that are fully conjugated, tautomerism is not possible because the necessary hydrogen isn't available. Wait, but in 1,3,5-trione, the alpha positions have two H's, so they should be able to tautomerize.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone, being a conjugated diketone, doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no. Each carbonyl is adjacent to CH groups, which have one hydrogen each.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that if a compound can undergo tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha hydrogen. Both compounds have alpha hydrogens, so both can tautomerize. But the question is asking which doesn't.

Wait, perhaps another possibility: benzoquinone is an aromatic compound, and tautomerism would break the aromaticity, so it doesn't happen. So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize.

So, in that case, the answer to part A would be benzoquinone, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Putting it together:

A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).

Looking at the options:

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. No, because B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Yes, that matches.

Wait, option B says A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism. So in part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is option B. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's correct according to our analysis.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the rearrangement of double bonds, typically requiring alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound is a six-membered aromatic ring with two ketone groups in para positions. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (alpha carbons) are CH groups, each with one hydrogen. However, benzoquinone is part of an aromatic system, and tautomerism would disrupt the aromaticity. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (alpha carbons) are CH2 groups, each with two hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerism, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry along the double bond. The carbons in the CH=CH group are not chiral centers, as they are bonded to identical groups. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
Combining the results from both parts:
- **A = benzoquinone**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
