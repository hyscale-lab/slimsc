Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this other operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two probabilities and an average value.

First, I'll break this down. I think the main steps are:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>.
2. Find the eigenstates of the operator with matrix A.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. Calculate the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate.
5. Calculate the average value of the operator using these probabilities.

Wait, but let's start with the given state. It's given as proportional, so I need to normalize it. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). To normalize, I'll compute the inner product of the state with itself and then divide each coefficient by the square root of that.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so the inner product is just the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Calculating each term: |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix is Aij. The matrix A is a 2x2 matrix, I think, because the state is in a two-level system (up and down). So A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So A looks like this:

[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2   0]

Wait, no, wait. The problem says Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the other elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]
Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

Wait no, that's correct. So the matrix A is:

A = [[0, ℏ/2],
     [ℏ/2, 0]]

But wait, the eigenstates of this operator are the same as the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction, I think. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here A is (ℏ/2) times that. So the eigenvalues would be plus and minus (ℏ/2).

Wait, let me check. The eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are ±1. So for a matrix proportional to that, the eigenvalues would be plus and minus the proportionality factor. So for A = (ℏ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues are (ℏ/2)(1) and (ℏ/2)(-1) → ℏ/2 and -ℏ/2.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the |right> and |left> eigenstates, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, just scaled by (ℏ/2).

So the two eigenstates are:

|φ+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|φ-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but I should make sure about the normalization. Each is 1/sqrt(2) times (|up> ± |down>). So yes, that's correct.

Now, the state |alpha> is given, and I need to express it in terms of |φ+> and |φ->. Because the operator A has these as its eigenstates, the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients when |alpha> is written as a linear combination of |φ+> and |φ->.

So, let's write |alpha> = a |φ+> + b |φ->, and find a and b.

Wait, but |alpha> is already written in terms of |up> and |down>. So perhaps I can express |alpha> in terms of |φ+> and |phi->.

Alternatively, I can compute the inner products of |alpha> with each |phi+> and |phi->.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ℏ/2 is |<phi+ | alpha>|^2, and similarly for -ℏ/2 with |<phi- | alpha>|^2.

So, let's compute these inner products.

But first, I should write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>. So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

And the eigenstates are |phi+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |phi-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the inner product <phi+ | alpha> is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ) ]

Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the inner product simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ]

Wait, no. Wait, <phi+| alpha> is [1/sqrt(2)] ( <up| + <down| ) acting on (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, all divided by sqrt(7).

So yes, when you compute the inner product:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> ) + (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ) ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the inner product as:

<phi+| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)*sqrt(7)^{-1} * 1 + (2 -i)*sqrt(7)^{-1} * 1 ]

Wait, no, because when you take inner product of |phi+> with |alpha>, you have:

= (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * <up|up> + (1/sqrt(2)) ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * <down|up> 

But <down|up> is zero, because they're orthogonal. Similarly, <up|up> is 1.

Wait, so let me correct that. So:

<phi+| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 0 ]

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, |phi+> is (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2). So when I take the inner product with |alpha>, which is a|up> + b|down>, the inner product is (a* + b*) times (1/sqrt(2)), where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So <phi+| alpha> = [ (1+i)* + (2 -i)* ] / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7).

Wait wait, because (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ) ]

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Another approach is to compute the inner product as (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Because <phi+| alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * <up|up> + (2-i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ] all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

But since <up|down> and <down|up> are zero, this simplifies to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

So, (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3. So (1/sqrt(2)) * 3 / sqrt(7) → 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) → 3/sqrt(14).

So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but wait, inner products should be complex numbers, but here I'm getting a real number. Let me check: (1+i) + (2 -i) is 1+2 +i -i → 3 + 0i → 3. So yes, it's real. So <phi+| alpha> = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

Wait, so the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the inner product <phi- | alpha> would be (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Because |phi-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So when you take inner product with |alpha>, you get (1+i) - (2 -i) all times 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

So (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i → (-1) + 2i → -1 + 2i.

So the inner product is ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14), because sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)=sqrt(14).

So the probability is |( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)|^2.

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, so that makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64286 and 5/14≈0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 (~0.64286) and 5/14 (~0.35714). So that's matching the first part of option A.

But wait, let me check the other part of the question. The average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute this directly.

Alternatively, because |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A, the expectation value would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

In this case, the eigenvalues are +ℏ/2 and -ℏ/2.

So the average value is (9/14)(ℏ/2) + (5/14)( -ℏ/2 ) → [9/(14) -5/(14)] (ℏ/2) → (4/14) (ℏ/2) → (2/7) (ℏ/2) → ℏ/7.

Wait, that's neat. So the average would be ℏ/7.

Looking back, option A says the average is ℏ/7, which matches what I just calculated.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ℏ/7. So option A matches both the probabilities and the average.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the average value.

Alternatively, I can compute <A> directly.

The operator A has matrix elements A12 = A21 = ℏ/2, and A11 = A22 =0.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but normalized by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me write this as:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, because A is a 2x2 matrix, so when you multiply A by the vector (a; b), you get a matrix product.

Actually, A is [[0, ℏ/2], [ℏ/2, 0]]. So A acting on the vector (a, b) is:

A (a, b) = ( (0*a) + (ℏ/2)*b, (ℏ/2)*a + 0*b ) = ( (ℏ/2)*b, (ℏ/2)*a )

So then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of ( (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ) with A |alpha>.

So A |alpha> is ( (ℏ/2)* (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ℏ/2)* (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

So the inner product is:

(1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ℏ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ℏ/2)*(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

= (ℏ/2) [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / (7)

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 → 2 -i -2i + (-1) → 2-3i -1 =1-3i.

Wait, wait, let me compute correctly:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)

= 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i + (-1) → 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i → 2 +2i +i +i² → 2+3i + (-1) →1 +3i.

So adding the two terms:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the inner product becomes (ℏ/2) * 2 /7 → (ℏ/2) * (2/7) )= ℏ * (1/7) )= ℏ/7.

Yes, that confirms the average value is ℏ/7. So option A is the correct choice, with probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average ℏ/7.

Wait, but the initial calculation of the probabilities using the eigenstates gave me 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.357143. So 0.64 and 0.36 are close enough, and option A is the only one with the average value of ℏ/7.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → matches.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3 hbar/sqrt7 → no.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt7 → no.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar/sqrt7 → no.

So the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the given state
The state is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle
\]

The normalization factor is determined by the inner product:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}[(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle]
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are:

\[
|\phi_+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |\phi_-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle)
\]

The corresponding eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |\phi_+\rangle \) and \( |\phi_-\rangle \)
The inner products of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |\phi_+\rangle \) and \( |\phi_-\rangle \) are:

\[
\langle \phi_+ | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

\[
\langle \phi_- | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |\phi_+\rangle \) and \( |\phi_-\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(|\phi_+\rangle) = \left| \langle \phi_+ | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad P(|\phi_-\rangle) = \left| \langle \phi_- | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \), the computation yields:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
From the above calculations, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
