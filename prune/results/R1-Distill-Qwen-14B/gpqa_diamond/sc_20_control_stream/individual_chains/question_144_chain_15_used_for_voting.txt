Alright, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, okay, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're bosons, I think. But wait, what's a resonance here? Oh right, in particle physics, a resonance refers to a particle with a very short lifetime, which makes its mass spread out in energy, which is what the width Γ represents.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of the meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

First, I think about the concept of mean decay distance. I recall that the mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for particles, the natural line width gives Γ = ΔE, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but actually, the exact relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Because Γ is the width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance (L) would be the product of the particle's velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

But wait, the velocity here, v, is the speed of the meson. How do I find that? I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Since the meson is moving, its total energy is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. But I don't have the momentum, so maybe I can find the velocity from the energy and mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocity using the relation between energy and momentum. Since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, but E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. Let me plug these numbers in. Let me compute the momentum p.

E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) in units where c=1 (like particle physics). So p c² = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV. Let me calculate that.

8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. Subtraction gives 62.56. So sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91 GeV. So p c ≈ 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c²? Wait, not sure about the units here. Maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1, but then units get a bit tricky when converting to meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocity v in terms of E and m. The velocity can be found from the relation v = pc² / E. Because in natural units, p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So p/(gamma m) = v. Let me think.

Wait, let's try to express v in terms of E and m. Since E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m v. So v = p c / (gamma m c²) * c²? Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Another approach: The velocity v can be expressed as v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Because from E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, and pc = sqrt(E² - m² c^4). So p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(c). Then, since E = gamma m c^2 and p = gamma m v, we have gamma m v = sqrt(E² - m^2 c^4)/c. So v = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(gamma m c^2). Hmm, but gamma is E/(m c²), so substituting that in, v = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) * c^2 / (E * m c^2) ) * (1/c) )? Wait, getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute beta, which is v/c. Beta is given by (pc)/(E). So beta = (sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)/c) ) / E. Let me compute that.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, this becomes beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

So, m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So m/E = 1.2 / 8 = 0.15. So (m/E)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is about 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, back to the lifetime. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but in natural units, ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm (femtometers). Let me recall that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

But to compute τ, which is ħ/(Gamma), but I need to make sure the units are consistent. Gamma is given in MeV, so let's convert that.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s, but in particle physics, using natural units (GeV, GeV⁻¹, etc.) can be tricky. Let me think in terms of units where ħ c is known in MeV·fm.

So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c. Wait, but in our case, when computing τ, the equation is τ = ħ / Γ. So let's compute that.

Γ is 320 MeV. So τ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / (320 MeV) ) * (1/c) ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c ? Because ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/(c). But I'm not sure about the exact units. Let me think of it as ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

Wait, no. If ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, then ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c. But I'm a bit confused on the exact unit conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute τ in seconds. Let me see. So, Γ is given in MeV, so to get τ in seconds, I can use the relation τ = ħ / Γ.

But ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 6.582e-25 GeV s is equal to 6.582e-25 * 1000 MeV s = 6.582e-22 MeV s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV s) / (320 MeV) ) = (6.582e-22 / 320) s ≈ 2.0568e-24 s.

Now, the decay distance is L = v τ. So v is approximately 0.9887c, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.0568e-24 s) ≈ 6.104e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. The options are 1e-15 or 1e-16 orders. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recheck that.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

So m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

(m/E)= 1.2/8 = 0.15.

(m/E)^2=0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 =0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= approximately how much? Let me compute that.

I know that sqrt(0.96)=0.98, sqrt(0.9801)=0.99, and 0.9775 is about 0.9887, so yes, beta is around 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, compute L again: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s = (2.966e8) * (2.0568e-24) = (2.966 *2.0568 )e-16.

2.966 * 2.0568 ≈ let's compute that.

2 *2 =4, 2.966 *2=5.932, 2.966 *0.0568≈0.1684, so total around 6.1004.

So L ≈6.1004e-16 m.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m and option D is 4.0655e-16 m. So 6e-16 isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me recompute beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

1.2^2 = 1.44, 8^2=64. So 1.44/64=0.0225.

1-0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is...

Let me calculate it precisely.

0.9775 is 9775/10000. Let me find the square root.

The square root of 0.9775: let me think in terms of known squares. 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.988^2 = (0.98 +0.008)^2= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 +0.008^2=0.9604 +0.01568 +0.000064=0.976144. Hmm, that's less than 0.9775.

0.988^2 =0.976144.

0.9885^2= let's compute:

(0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988² + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

0.988² is 0.976144.

2 *0.988 *0.0005 =0.000988.

0.0005^2=0.00000025.

So total is 0.976144 +0.000988 +0.00000025≈0.97713225.

Hmm, but we have 0.9775. So 0.9885^2=0.97713. Which is less than 0.9775.

Let's try 0.9887.

0.9887^2: let me compute this.

(0.988 +0.0007)^2=0.988² + 2*0.988*0.0007 +0.0007^2.

0.988²=0.976144.

2 *0.988 *0.0007=0.0013832.

0.0007^2=0.00000049.

So total is 0.976144 +0.0013832=0.9775272 + 0.00000049≈0.97752769.

That's very close to 0.97752769. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, so v ≈0.9887 c.

Wait, but wait—maybe the error is in the calculation of tau. Let me recheck.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

Earlier, I used ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's correct.

Then L = v * tau.

v = 0.9887 c = 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L= 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966e8) * (2.056875e-24) = (2.966 *2.056875) )e-16.

Compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me calculate:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = approximately 0.1684.

Total ≈ 6.1004. So 6.1004e-16 m.

But the options are 5e-16 or 4e-16. Hmm. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the velocity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps instead of using beta, I should calculate the decay length using the formula L = (c * tau) * beta.

Yes, because L = v * tau = beta c * tau.

So L = beta c tau.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it that way.

So beta is 0.9887, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.0568e-24 s.

So beta*c*tau = 0.9887 *3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Multiply 3e8 *2.0568e-24 = 6.1704e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.1704e-16 *0.9887 ≈6.105e-16 m.

Same result as before. So about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta?

Wait, maybe the energy is the total energy, but perhaps the production energy is not the same as the kinetic energy. Or, wait, perhaps E is the energy, which includes rest mass plus kinetic.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should compute the lifetime using the width, and then compute the speed using E and m.

Alternatively, perhaps a formula exists that directly relates the decay length with these parameters.

Wait, I remember a formula for the decay length: L = (c * ħ) / (Γ) * (E/m) * (sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) ) / c.

Wait, perhaps let me reorganize the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Maybe I should use exact expressions.

Let me try to compute beta more precisely.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

m =1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

m/E = 0.15.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887168.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, let me compute 0.9887^2 is about 0.977527, which is slightly above 0.9775. So maybe a more accurate beta is approximately 0.98869.

But maybe this level of precision isn't necessary. Let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use units more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity as (pc^2)/(E), because p c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4), and E = gamma m c².

Wait, let's compute p c:

p c = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(64 -1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈7.91 GeV.

So p c =7.91 GeV.

So v = (p c^2 ) / E.

Wait, because E = gamma m c², p = gamma m v. So p c = gamma m v c.

So v = (p c) / (gamma m).

But gamma = E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.666... So gamma = 6.6667.

So v = (p c) / (gamma m c²) * c².

Wait, maybe it's better to express v in terms of E and p.

v = (p c²) / E.

Because E = gamma m c², p = gamma m v.

So p = (gamma m v) → v = p/(gamma m) * c².

Wait, perhaps:

v = (p c^2) / E.

Because p c = sqrt(E² - m^2 c^4).

So v = [ sqrt(E² -m^2 c^4) * c^2 ] / E.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, this simplifies to beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2), which is what I had before.

So, perhaps my initial approach was correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps I should include the rest frame lifetime and then calculate the lab frame lifetime using time dilation.

Wait, the mean lifetime tau is the proper time, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma.

Wait, but the width Gamma is related to the lifetime as Gamma = ħ / tau.

Wait, no, actually, in the rest frame, the width is Γ. So the lifetime in rest frame is tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

But when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed is tau = gamma tau_0.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering the gamma factor earlier.

Ah! That's probably where I went wrong. Because if the particle is moving at a high speed, its lifetime is time-dilated. So tau = gamma tau_0.

So, let's recalculate this.

Tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Then, tau = gamma * tau_0.

Gamma is the width, which is the same in all frames. So, in the rest frame, tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

In the lab frame, tau = gamma * tau_0.

So that's the correction I was missing.

Now, gamma is E/(m c²) =8 GeV / (1.2 GeV c²) → wait, but in natural units, E is in GeV and m c² is GeV, so gamma = 8 /1.2 ≈6.6667.

So gamma ≈6.6667.

So, tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, tau = gamma * tau_0 =6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈1.371e-23 s.

Wait, that's a larger tau than before. So v is still about 0.9887 c, so L = v * tau.

So v =0.9887 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So L =2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = (2.966 *1.371 )e-15 m.

Compute 2.966 *1.371. Let's see:

3 *1.371 =4.113. But 2.966 is 3 less 0.034.

So 2.966 *1.371 =3 *1.371 - 0.034 *1.371.

3 *1.371=4.113.

0.034 *1.371≈0.0466.

So 4.113 -0.0466≈4.0664.

So L≈4.0664e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value. So option B is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by using the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} \). The decay distance \( L \) is related to the particle's velocity \( v \) and lifetime \( \tau \) by \( L = v \tau \).

### Step 1: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) can be expressed in terms of the energy and mass using the relation:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]
where \( \beta = v/c \). Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]
Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Therefore:
\[
v \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \). Converting \( \Gamma \) to GeV (\( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)):
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Account for time dilation
Since the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667.
\]
The lab-frame lifetime is:
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay distance \( L \)
The decay distance is:
\[
L = v \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}) \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
