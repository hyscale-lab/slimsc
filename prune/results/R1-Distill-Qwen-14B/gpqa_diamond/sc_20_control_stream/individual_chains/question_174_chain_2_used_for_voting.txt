Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. The question is about the kinetic energy of a fragment after fission, and the difference between the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations. 

Alright, first, the setup: an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. 

Wait, so the initial nucleus has mass M, which is at rest. So its initial energy is just its rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the two fragments have rest masses adding up to 0.99M. So that leaves 1% of M as the mass converted into kinetic energy, right? Or maybe not, because in reality, some energy is lost as binding energy or other forms, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so perhaps the other energy comes into play. 

Wait, the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is M c squared. Then the two fragments' rest masses sum to 0.99 M. So the total rest mass energy after is 0.99 M c squared. The initial was M c squared. So the difference is 0.01 M c squared, which would be the energy released, right? But that's probably the total kinetic energy of both fragments.

Wait, but they're asking about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So I need to find T1 relativistically and then subtract the non-relativistic T1 to find the difference.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial mass: M
- Initial rest energy: 300 GeV
- After fission: two fragments, m1 and m2
- m1 = 2 * m2 (rest masses)
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 M

So m1 = 2 m2
m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, no: 0.99 M divided by 3 is 0.33 M each? No: 3 m2 =0.99 M → m2= 0.33 M. So m1= 2 * 0.33 = 0.66 M. So yes, the more massive fragment is 0.66 M.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their velocities are opposite, but their kinetic energies would depend on their rest masses and velocities.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state, the total energy is M c² = 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

So,

Total energy after = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2)

But the initial total energy is M c².

So,

M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + T1 + T2.

We know m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so:

300 GeV = (0.99 M c²) + (T1 + T2)

The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so 0.99 M c² is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. 

So,

300 GeV = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2)

So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Now, conservation of momentum: since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after is zero. So,

p1 = -p2.

The magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite.

In terms of relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v. But since we can also express this in terms of energy, perhaps it's easier to use energy-momentum relation.

Energy of each fragment is E1 = sqrt( (p1 c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 ) 

Similarly, E2 = sqrt( (p2 c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

But since p2 = -p1, their magnitudes are the same. So let me denote p as the magnitude of p1, so p2 = p.

So,

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

But E1 = m1 c² + T1

E2 = m2 c² + T2

And from earlier, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2) ) = (m1 + m2) c² + (T1 + T2) ) = 297 GeV + 3 GeV = 300 GeV, which matches the initial energy.

But I think I need another equation to relate p for each fragment.

Let me write the energies:

E1 = sqrt( p² c² + m1² c^4 )

E2 = sqrt( p² c² + m2² c^4 )

But E1 = m1 c² + T1 and E2 = m2 c² + T2.

So,

sqrt( p² c² + m1² c^4 ) = m1 c² + T1

Similarly,

sqrt( p² c² + m2² c^4 ) = m2 c² + T2

Let me square both sides for E1:

p² c² + m1^2 c^4 = (m1 c² + T1 )^2

Expanding the right side: m1² c^4 + 2 m1 c² T1 + T1^2

So,

p² c² = 2 m1 c² T1 + T1^2

Similarly for E2:

p² c² + m2^2 c^4 = (m2 c^2 + T2 )^2

Which gives:

p² c^2 = 2 m2 c^2 T2 + T2^2

So, setting the two expressions for p² c^2 equal:

2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2 c² T2 + T2²

But from earlier, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can make some approximations first. Let me think about the non-relativistic case and then see how relativistic effects change things.

In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². Also, momentum p = m v.

So for non-relativistic, let me model that.

Conservation of momentum: m1 v1 = m2 v2

Because the initial momentum is zero, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v1 = -(m2/m1) v2.

Wait, no. Wait, the nucleus is split into two, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

So, v1 = -(m2/m1) v2.

In non-relativistic, the kinetic energy of each is (1/2) m v^2.

So,

T1 = 1/2 m1 v1^2

T2 = 1/2 m2 v2^2

Total kinetic energy T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

But since from momentum conservation,

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v1 = (m2/m1) v2.

So,

T1 = (1/2) m1 ( (m2/m1 )^2 v2^2 ) = (1/2) (m2^2/m1) v2^2.

Similarly, T2 = (1/2) m2 v2^2.

So,

T1 = (m2^2/(2 m1)) v2^2,

T2 = (m2 v2^2)/2.

So,

T1 + T2 = (m2^2 + m2 m1 )/(2 m1 ) ) * v2^2.

But since m1 = 2 m2,

m1 = 2 m2 → substitute:

= ( m2^2 + m2 * 2 m2 ) / (2 * 2 m2 ) ) v2^2

= ( m2^2 + 2 m2^2 ) / (4 m2 ) ) v2^2

= (3 m2^2) / (4 m2 ) ) v2^2 = (3 m2 /4 ) v2^2.

So,

T1 + T2 = (3 m2/4 ) v2^2 = 3 GeV.

But wait, T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

So,

v2^2 = (3 GeV *4 ) / (3 m2 )

= (12 GeV )/(3 m2 ) = 4 GeV / m2.

But m2 is 0.33 M. So m2 = 0.33 M.

But M c^2 is 300 GeV. So m2 c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV =99 GeV.

So m2 = 99 GeV / c².

Wait, but in non-relativistic terms, m2 is 99 GeV/c².

But wait, in non-relativistic, the mass is m, and kinetic energy is in terms of (GeV), so perhaps the units will work out. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should express v in terms of c. Let me think.

Wait, in non-relativistic terms, the mass is m, so when I have v in terms of c, I can compute the kinetic energy.

But perhaps it's better to compute v2.

From the non-relativistic approach:

v2^2 = (4 GeV ) / m2.

But m2 is 0.33 M, and M c² is 300 GeV → M = 300 GeV / c².

So m2 = 0.33 * (300 GeV / c² ) = 99 GeV / c².

So,

v2^2 =4 GeV / (99 GeV / c² ) ) → 4 c² /99.

So v2 = sqrt(4/99) c ≈ (2)/sqrt(99) c ≈ 2/(9.9499) ) c ≈ 0.201 c.

Hmm, so about 0.2 times the speed of light. So non-relativistic is perhaps not a great approximation, but maybe okay for a first approximation.

Now, using this v2, compute T1 and T2.

But wait, for non-relativistic, T1 is (1/2) m1 v1^2.

v1 = (m2/m1) v2 → since m1 = 2 m2, so m2/m1 = 0.5.

So v1 = 0.5 * v2 = 0.5 * 0.201 c ≈ 0.1005 c.

So,

T1 = 1/2 * m1 * v1^2.

m1 is 0.66 M → 0.66 * 300 GeV/c² = 198 GeV/c².

v1^2 is (0.1005 c)^2 = (0.0101) c².

So,

T1 = 0.5 * 198 GeV/c² * 0.0101 c² → 0.5 *198 *0.0101 GeV → approximately 0.5 * 198 *0.0101 ≈ 0.5 * 1.9998 ≈ 1 GeV.

Similarly, T2 is 0.5 * m2 * v2^2 → m2 is 99 GeV/c².

v2^2 is (0.201 c)^2 = 0.0404 c².

So,

T2 = 0.5 *99 * 0.0404 → 0.5 *99 *0.0404 ≈ 0.5 * 3.9996 ≈ 2 GeV.

So total T1 + T2 ≈ 3 GeV, which matches. So non-rel T1 is about 1 GeV.

But wait, the real (relativistic) T1 is going to be different. Let's compute the relativistic case.

In the relativistic case, we have two equations:

E1 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m1^2 c^4 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m2^2 c^4 )

And,

E1 = m1 c² + T1,

E2 = m2 c² + T2.

And T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Also, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2 ) = (m1 + m2 ) c² + (T1 + T2 ) ) = 0.99 M c² + 3 GeV = 297 GeV +3 GeV =300 GeV.

So that's correct.

But I need to find p. Let me express E1 and E2 in terms of p.

Let me denote:

E1 = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m1^2 c^4 ) / c² → Hmm, perhaps it's easier to let E1 = m1 c² γ1, where γ1 is the Lorentz factor for the first fragment.

Similarly, E2 = m2 c² γ2.

Then,

E1 = m1 c² γ1 = m1 c² + T1.

So,

γ1 = 1 + T1/( m1 c² )

Similarly,

γ2 = 1 + T2/( m2 c² )

But also, from momentum conservation.

The momentum p = gamma m v. Since the two fragments have opposite momenta, their momenta magnitudes are equal. So,

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = (gamma1 m1 v1 ) c → Wait, no, units are tricky. Maybe express momentum in terms of gamma and velocity.

Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and v = c * beta, then p = gamma m beta c.

So,

p = gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But since the velocities are in opposite directions, the beta terms have opposite signs but same magnitude, so beta1 = - beta2. But let's take magnitudes:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But beta1 = v1 / c, beta2 = v2 / c.

So,

gamma1 m1 (v1/c) = gamma2 m2 (v2/c)

→ gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, but from momentum conservation, the total momentum is zero: so m1 v1 = m2 v2, but here in relativistic terms, the momentum is gamma m v, so the equation is gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Wait, but in the initial nucleus, the system is at rest, so the total momentum after must be zero. So, p1 + p2 =0 → p1 = -p2. So, the magnitudes are equal: |p1| = |p2|.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But from the non-relativistic case, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but in relativity, it's more complicated.

I think I need to find T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an approximation that for lighter nuclei, the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, so that gamma is close to 1. But in this case, since the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is about 1% of 300 GeV. So, perhaps the velocities are small, making the non-relativistic approximation reasonably accurate. But wait, the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1.

Wait, the problem gives options on the order of a few MeV (2,5,10,20). So the difference is small, which suggests that the relativistic effect is small, perhaps in the order of MeV, which is much smaller than the GeV scale.

Hmm, so perhaps the non-relativistic calculation gives T1 as around 1 GeV, but the relativistic calculation gives a slightly higher or lower value, and the difference is about say 20 MeV.

But I need to compute the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the kinetic energies using the ratio of the masses.

Let me denote m1 = 2 m2.

So,

m1 = 2 m2.

So, m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = m1/2.

We also know that T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

But perhaps I can express everything in terms of T1.

Since m1 =2 m2,

m2 = m1/2.

So,

E1 = m1 c² + T1,

E2 = (m1/2) c² + T2.

But E2 = sqrt( p² c^4 + (m2 c² )^2 ) = sqrt( p² c^4 + ( (m1/2) c^2 )^2 )

Similarly,

E1 = sqrt(p² c^4 + (m1 c² )^2 )

But from E1 and E2,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

E1 = m1 c² + T1,

E2 = (m1/2) c² + T2.

So,

(m1 c² + T1 ) + ( (m1/2) c² + T2 ) ) = 300 GeV.

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M,

m1 + m2 = m1 + m1/2 = (3/2) m1 =0.99 M → m1 = (0.99 * 2/3) M =0.66 M.

So,

m1 c² =0.66 * 300 GeV =198 GeV,

m2 c² = 99 GeV.

So,

(198 GeV + T1 ) + (99 GeV + T2 ) =300 GeV.

So,

297 GeV + T1 + T2 =300 GeV → T1 + T2=3 GeV.

Which is what we had before.

So, back to the equations.

We have,

E1 = sqrt( p² c^4 + (198 GeV )^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p² c^4 + (99 GeV )^2 )

But,

E1 =198 GeV + T1,

E2 =99 GeV + T2.

And,

T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

Let me denote x= T1, so T2=3 GeV -x.

So,

E1 =198 + x,

E2=99 + (3 -x) )=102 -x.

Now,

E1 = sqrt( p² c^4 + (198 )^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p² c^4 + (99 )^2 )

But,

E1 =198 + x,

E2 =102 -x.

So,

sqrt( p² c^4 + 198^2 ) =198 +x,

and,

sqrt( p² c^4 + 99^2 ) =102 -x.

Let me square both equations.

First equation:

p² c^4 + 198^2 = (198 +x)^2 = 198² + 396 x + x².

Subtract 198²:

p² c^4 = 396 x +x².

Similarly, second equation:

p² c^4 + 99^2 = (102 -x)^2 = 102² - 204 x + x^2.

Subtract 99^2 (9801):

p² c^4 =10404 -204 x +x² -9801 = (10404 -9801) + (-204 x) + x^2 → 603 -204 x +x^2.

So,

From first equation: p² c^4 =396 x +x².

From second equation: p² c^4 =603 -204 x +x^2.

Set equal:

396 x +x² =603 -204 x +x^2.

Subtract x² from both sides:

396 x =603 -204 x.

396x +204x=603 → 600x=603 → x=603/600= 1.005 GeV.

Wait, that's interesting. So T1= x=1.005 GeV.

But wait, the non-relativistic case gave T1≈1 GeV, and relativistic gives 1.005 GeV.

But wait, that's a very small difference, but the options are in MeV. So 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV.

Wait, because 0.005 GeV =5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is about 1.005 GeV, and the non-relativistic approximation gives 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the correct answer would be option B) 5 MeV.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

From the equations:

396 x =603 -204x.

396x +204x =603.

600x=603 → x=603/600= 1.005 GeV.

So T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is 1005 MeV.

Non-relativistic had T1 as approximately 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

So the difference is 5 MeV. So the correct answer is B) 5 MeV.

Wait, but why is the relativistic T1 higher than the non-relativistic?

Because in the non-relativistic case, we took KE as (1/2) mv², but in reality, the kinetic energy depends on gamma. So for a given momentum, higher mass fragments have lower KE. Wait, wait, let's think about it.

Wait, when the nucleus splits, the more massive fragment would have less kinetic energy in the non-relativistic case because it's harder to accelerate a larger mass. But in the relativistic case, perhaps the situation is a bit different.

Wait, let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has lower KE. So T1=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is a bit higher. Wait, but that's a small increase. Hmm.

Wait, but let me think about the energy and momentum.

In the non-relativistic case, the KE is lower, but when you include relativity, the KE increases.

Wait, perhaps because in the relativistic case, the gamma factor is a bit higher, leading to higher KE.

But why did the calculation give T1 as 1.005 GeV in the relativistic case?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Let me recheck the steps.

We had,

E1 =198 +x,

E2=99 + (3 -x) =102 -x.

We wrote:

sqrt( p² c^4 + 198^2 )=198 +x → square gives p² c^4 = (198 +x)^2 -198^2 = 396 x +x².

Similarly,

sqrt(p² c^4 +99^2 )=102 -x → square gives p² c^4 = (102 -x)^2 -99^2.

Compute (102 -x)^2 -99^2:

(102 -x)^2 = 10404 -204x +x².

99^2 is 9801.

So,

p² c^4= (10404 -204x +x²) -9801 = 603 -204x +x^2.

So,

396 x +x² = 603 -204 x +x^2.

So, 396x =603 -204x → 396x +204x=603 → 600x=603 →x=603/600=1.005.

Yes, that's correct.

So the relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, non-relativistic is 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the correct answer is 5 MeV, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks to determine the difference in the kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The initial nucleus has rest mass \( M \) and rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).  
   - The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is \( 99\% \) of \( M \), i.e., \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).

2. **Rest Masses of Fragments**:  
   Using \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), we solve:  
   \[
   3m_2 = 0.99M \implies m_2 = 0.33M, \quad m_1 = 0.66M.
   \]  
   Converting to energy units, \( m_1c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_2c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after fission is conserved. Initially, the energy is \( Mc^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \). After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments:  
   \[
   Mc^2 = (m_1c^2 + T_1) + (m_2c^2 + T_2).
   \]  
   Substituting \( m_1c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_2c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( Mc^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:  
   \[
   300 = 198 + 99 + T_1 + T_2 \implies T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

4. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. This implies the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_1 = -p_2.
   \]

### Non-Relativistic Approximation:
In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), and momentum is \( p = mv \). Using conservation of momentum and energy, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment \( T_1 \) is calculated to be approximately **1 GeV**.

### Relativistic Calculation:
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment includes a Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):  
\[
E_1 = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_1^2c^4}, \quad E_2 = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_2^2c^4}.
\]  
The total energy is also expressed as:  
\[
E_1 = m_1c^2 + T_1, \quad E_2 = m_2c^2 + T_2.
\]  
Substituting \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \) and solving the system of equations, the relativistic \( T_1 \) is found to be **1.005 GeV**.

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \):
The difference between the relativistic \( T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \) and the non-relativistic \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) is:  
\[
\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is **5 MeV**.

Answer: B
