Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that pinacol is a diol, so it has two adjacent alcohol groups. The reaction happens under acidic conditions, right? The process involves protonation of one alcohol, then a hydride shift, leading to a ketone. 

The question has two parts. The first is about reaction A converting into 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one using H2SO4. The second is about another starting material (methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate) reacting to form product B.

Let me tackle the first part first. So, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. That means it's a cyclohexanone ring with two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon (carbon 2) and a ketone at position 1. Wait, no, position 2 is where the two substituents are. Oh wait, 2,2-di-p-tolyl means two p-tolyl groups on carbon 2. So the ring is cyclohexanone, and substituents are both p-tolyl at C2.

So, the starting material for the Pinacol rearrangement (A) must be a diol. In the pinacol structure, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons. So for this product, the diol must have been on a cyclohexane ring, adjacent, and each attached to a p-tolyl group.

Wait, the product has two p-tolyl groups on C2. So in the starting diol, each of those would be on adjacent OH-bearing carbons. Let's think about the structure of pinacol. The diol has two OHs on adjacent carbons. When it undergoes rearrangement, one OH gets protonated, then a hydride shift occurs. So the diol would have been something like (HO-R-OH) connected in a way that, after rearrangement, the hydroxyls are on adjacent carbons in a way that, after shift, you get a ketone.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2. So the starting diol must have had two OH groups on adjacent carbons in a cyclohexane ring. But wait, if the diol is adjacent, and after rearrangement, the structure changes. Maybe the diol is on a cyclohexane ring, but perhaps in a pinacol-like structure.

Wait, the starting material is A: 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the structure would have a cyclohexanol (OH on C1), and a CH2 group connected to C1, which has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. Wait, that might be the structure.

Wait, let me visualize. So, the molecule is cyclohexan-1-ol, meaning the OH is on carbon 1. Then, attached to carbon 1 is a CH2 group, which has two p-tolyl substituents and another OH. So the structure would be cyclohexanol with a CH2(OH)(C6H4-p-tolyl)2 group attached to C1.

When this undergoes acid-catalyzed rearrangement, what happens? So, first, one of the OHs gets protonated. Probably the one on the CH2 group, since the other is on the cyclohexane ring. Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon. Wait, the structure is a diol with two adjacent OHs? Oh wait, no, the starting diol has two OHs on adjacent carbons. Wait, in the molecule A, the structure is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the cyclohexanol has a CH2 group attached, which has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the CH2 has two p-tolyl groups and an OH attached. So the structure is probably like:

cyclohexanol (OH on C1) connected to a CH2 group, which has two p-tolyl substituents and another OH. So the CH2 would be between the two p-tolyl groups and the OH and the cyclohexanol.

Wait, perhaps the diol is on the same carbon as the cyclohexanol? No, because it's on the CH2. So the diol is on adjacent carbons: one on the CH2 (the OH attached to it) and the other on the cyclohexane's C1. Oh wait, no, that can't be right because they're not adjacent. Because the cyclohexane's C1 is attached to the CH2, which has another OH. So the two OHs are on C1 (cyclohexanol) and on the CH2 attached to it. Are these adjacent? Hmm. Adjacent in the overall structure but in different parts. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Pinacol structure.

Wait, in the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol is usually 1,2-diol. So, the diol should have adjacent OH groups. So, in the starting material A, the two OHs should be on adjacent carbons.

But the structure given in option A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So the cyclohexanol has a CH2 group attached, which is connected to two p-tolyl groups and an OH.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring has an OH on C1. The C1 is connected to a CH2 group. That CH2 has two p-tolyl substituents and another OH. So the structure is:

cyclohexanol-OH on C1, and the CH2 group attached to C1 has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So, the molecule is:

cyclohexan-1-ol connected to CH2(OH)(C6H4-p-tolyl)2.

Wait, but that would mean the diol is on C1 (cyclohexanol) and on the CH2. So the two OHs are on adjacent carbons (C1 and the CH2). So that's a 1,2-diol. So, that fits the Pinacol structure.

When acid is added, one of the OHs gets protonated. The protonation likely occurs on the more substituted or more accessible OH. Once protonated, a hydride shift occurs from an adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then forms the ketone.

In this case, the hydride shift would move from the cyclohexane ring. Wait, let's imagine the structure. After protonation of the CH2's OH, it becomes -O-H2+. Then, a hydride from the adjacent C (cyclohexane's C1) moves. Wait, but C1 is attached to the CH2. So if the CH2 has Hs, perhaps a hydride from the cyclohexane's adjacent carbon (like C2) shifts to the carbocation at the CH2.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formation of the ketone. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So after the rearrangement, the ketone is on C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

Wait, in the starting material, the CH2 group (with two p-tolyls and an OH) is attached to C1 of the cyclohexanol. So when the rearrangement happens, the CH2 becomes part of the cyclohexanone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what the product is. The product is cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2. So the ketone is on C1 of the cyclohexanone. So the starting material must have a diol where the two OHs are on C1 and C2. Wait, but in the starting material, the diol is on C1 and the CH2 group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a mesitylene diol, but connected to the cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol where the two OHs are on adjacent carbons of a chain attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexane with two substituents: a hydroxyl group and a CH2OH group, but both attached to adjacent carbons. Or maybe the diol is on the same carbon as the cyclohexanol. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,2-diol on the cyclohexane ring. Like, two adjacent hydroxyl groups on the cyclohexane. But the product is a cyclohexanone with substituents on C2. So, after the rearrangement, the carbonyl is at C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

So, the rearrangement for the first part would involve the diol on C1 and C2 of the cyclohexane. Then, after protonation of one OH, a hydride shift occurs, leading to the carbonyl at C1 and the substituents on C2.

Wait, but the starting material A is given as 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So that's a cyclohexanol that has a CH2 group attached to C1, which has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the structure is:

cyclohexanol (OH on C1) connected via CH2 to a C which has two p-tolyl groups and an OH. So the diol is the OH on C1 and the OH on the CH2. Are those on adjacent carbons? The OH on C1 and the OH on CH2 are attached to C1 and the CH2, which is connected to C1. So the diol is on adjacent carbons (C1 and the CH2), which are connected by a single bond. So that's a 1,2-diol in the overall structure.

When this undergoes the Pinacol rearrangement, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons. So, the acid will protonate one of them, say the OH on the CH2. Then, a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon (C1 of the cyclohexane) to the carbocation at the CH2. Wait, but if the CH2 is attached to C1, and the hydride comes from C1, that would form a carbocation on the CH2. Then, the adjacent OH (on C1 of the cyclohexane) leaves, and after rearrangement, the ketone forms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure after protonation. Let's imagine the structure after the protonation of the CH2 OH. That becomes CH2-O-H2+. Then, the hydride shift occurs from the adjacent cyclohexane C1. So, the C1 (cyclohexane) donates a hydride to the CH2-O(+), leading to a carbocation on the cyclohexane's C1.

Wait, but then the structure would have a carbocation on C1. Then, perhaps the adjacent CH2 (which was the diol part) would lose a water molecule, forming a double bond. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe another approach: the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is at C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

In the starting material, the two p-tolyl groups are on the CH2 group attached to C1. So, during the rearrangement, the CH2 group becomes part of the cyclohexane ring, moving to C2, and the ketone forms at C1.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group (with two p-tolyls and an OH) is acting like a substituent that, upon rearrangement, becomes attached to C2. So, the starting material's structure after rearrangement would push the p-tolyl groups to C2 and the ketone to C1.

So, when the Pinacol rearrangement occurs, the diol (with OHs on C1 and CH2) rearranges such that the p-tolyl groups end up on the same carbon (C2) and the ketone is on C1.

So for the first part, the starting material A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. Yes, that matches.

So, the first reaction's product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, option A's product is correct for part A.

Now, the second reaction: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 → B.

What would B be? Let's analyze the starting material. It's methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(CH2C6H4-p-tolyl)CH(OH)CH2OH ?

Wait, wait, but wait. The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So the structure is: the ester is at the end of a four-carbon chain. The chain is: CH2-C(O)OCH3 is the ester part. The 2 position has a p-tolyl group. So, the structure is:

CH2-C(O)OCH3 is the ester. Then, the 2nd carbon (adjacent to ester) has a p-tolyl group and two OH groups? Wait, no. Wait, 2,3-dihydroxy means the second and third carbons have OH groups.

Wait, but wait, the butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3? No, butanoate is four carbons: CH3CH2CH2COOCH3. But in this case, it's 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 is the butanoate group. Wait, butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3? No, butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, but the starting material is 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So the structure of the acid would be:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH(OH)–CH2(OH)–p-tolyl? No, wait, but the butanoate has four carbons. Let me number them:

1: COOCH3 (the ester group)

2: next carbon, which has a p-tolyl group and an OH

3: next carbon, which has an OH

4: CH3 (butanoate ends with CH3)

Wait, but butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COOCH3? No, butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3? No, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The structure is:

The butanoate is CH2CH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, butanoate is four carbons: COOCH3 is the first carbon, then three more. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 (C1)

C2: connected to C1, has a p-tolyl group and a hydroxyl.

C3: has a hydroxyl.

C4: connected to C3, perhaps a CH3 or another group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (C1)

C2: CH(p-tolyl)(OH)

C3: CH(OH)

C4: CH3

So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH(OH)(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the structure is:

p-tolyl group on C2, with two OH groups on C2 and C3. So, the starting material is a diol ester.

When this undergoes the Pinacol rearrangement, what happens? The diol is on C2 and C3. So, under acidic conditions, one OH is protonated, then a hydride shift occurs. The product would be a ketone.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol (1,2-diol) rearranges to a ketone. The adjacent diol's groups migrate. So, in this case, the diol is on C2 and C3, and the p-tolyl is on C2.

So, after protonation, the adjacent C3's hydrogen (a hydride) would shift to the carbocation on C2. Then, the structure would form a ketone on C2, and the adjacent groups would rearrange.

Wait, but the starting structure is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So the groups are:

C1: COOCH3

C2: CH(OH)(p-tolyl)

C3: CH(OH)

C4: CH3

So, when the diol is on C2 and C3, the Pinacol rearrangement would lead to the formation of a ketone on C2, with the p-tolyl group and the group from C3.

Wait, let's imagine the mechanism. Protonation of one of the OH groups, say on C2. Then, a hydride shift from C3 to C2. The C3's OH would lose a proton, and the adjacent CH(OH) would shift a hydride to C2. So, C2 becomes a carbocation, then the adjacent C3's group (OH) leaves, and the structure rearranges.

Wait, no. Let me correct. After protonation, the structure becomes a good leaving group at C2. Then, a hydride shifts from C3 to C2, forming a carbocation on C3. Then, perhaps the ester group or another group would form the ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the diol is 2 and 3. So, after protonation of C3's OH, the adjacent C2's H (hydride) shifts to C3, forming a carbocation on C2. Then, the adjacent group (C3's OH) would leave as water, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement leads to the formation of a ketone at C2, with the p-tolyl and the CH3 group attached.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is a diol (C2 and C3), with a p-tolyl on C2 and a methyl ester on C1. After rearrangement, the ketone forms at C2, and the substituents from C3 and C2 would form the new structure.

So, the product would be a ketone on C2, with substituents from C3. So the product B would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Because the ketone is on C2, but wait, maybe not.

Wait, let me think of the product structure. After rearrangement, the diol on C2 and C3 would lead to a ketone on C2. The substituents from C3 would move to C2. So the p-tolyl is on C2, and from C3, perhaps a CH2 group comes.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate? Or another structure.

Wait, the starting material is butanoate, which is four carbons. After rearrangement, would the chain length change? No, the chain length remains four carbons, but the functional groups rearrange.

Wait, but in the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol converts into a ketone, and the substituents shift. So, the product would have the ketone at the position where the diol was. For example, if the diol is on C2 and C3, the ketone would be on C2, and the substituent from C3 would move to C2, leading to a branching.

Wait, maybe the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain. The starting material is a four-carbon chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate? No, that wouldn't make sense because the starting material is butanoate, so the product should have four carbons.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. Let me see. Let's think of the starting material as:

COOCH3 (C1) - CH(OH)(p-tolyl) (C2) - CH(OH) (C3) - CH3 (C4)

When the Pinacol rearrangement occurs, the diol (C2 and C3) rearranges. The acid protonates one OH, say on C3. Then, a hydride shifts from C2 to C3, forming a carbocation on C2. Then, perhaps the adjacent groups (like the ester) would form the ketone.

Wait, maybe the Pinacol rearrangement leads to the formation of a ketone at C2, with the p-tolyl and the adjacent groups.

Wait, another approach: the Pinacol rearrangement of a diol leads to the formation of a ketone where the diol was, with the substituents moving. For the diol at C2 and C3, the product would have a ketone at C2, which is connected to the p-tolyl group and the group from C3.

Wait, the starting material's C3 is connected to CH(OH) and CH3. So when the rearrangement happens, the group from C3 (CH3) would move to C2 upon hydride shift. So the product would be a ketone at C2, attached to p-tolyl and CH(CH3). Or maybe a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. Let me think.

Wait, the product should lose a water molecule. The diol is on C2 and C3. After rearrangement, the ketone is on C2, and the rest of the structure would have the p-tolyl and the adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. But that would be a three-carbon chain, but the starting material is a four-carbon chain.

Alternatively, maybe the product retains the four carbons but now has a ketone on C3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options. Let's look at the options for B.

Option A: B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option C: B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Wait, what is the structure of the product?

If the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, after the Pinacol rearrangement, the product would have a ketone where the diol was.

So, the diol is on C2 and C3. The rearrangement would form a ketone on C2, with substituents from C3.

Wait, wait, perhaps the starting material is:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH(OH)(p-tolyl)–CH(OH)–CH3

After rearrangement, the ketone would form on C2, and the groups from the neighboring carbons would shift. So, perhaps the structure becomes:

CH2(COOCH3)–C(O)–(CH2CH3)–CH3 ?

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. That would imply that the ketone is on C3, which was adjacent to the diol. But the diol was on C2 and C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate, which is a three-carbon chain. But the starting material is four carbons, so that's not likely.

Wait, maybe the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which would have the ketone on C3. But that's a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

COOCH3 (C1) - CH2 (C2) - C(O) (C3) - CH3 (C4)

But where would the p-tolyl group be? It was on C2 in the starting material. After rearrangement, the p-tolyl would be on C2.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 2-(p-tolyl)-3-oxobutanoate. That is:

COOCH3 (C1) - CH(p-tolyl) (C2) - C(O) (C3) - CH3 (C4)

So, the structure would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which matches option A for B.

Alternatively, if the product is a ketone on C2, then it would be methyl 2-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate, but that's a three-carbon chain.

Wait, the product B, according to option A, is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So the ketone is on C3, which was C3 in the starting material. But the diol was on C2 and C3, so the ketone would form on C2 or C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the Pinacol rearrangement leads to the formation of a carbonyl group at the position where the diol was, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another way to think: in the Pinacol rearrangement, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons (C2 and C3). After rearrangement, the carbonyl group will form between C2 and C3.

Wait, no, the rearrangement causes the diol to become a ketone. So, for a 1,2-diol, the rearrangement leads to a ketone on the same carbon as one of the OH groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3 (C1) - CH2 (C2) - C(O) (C3) - CH3 (C4)

But where's the p-tolyl group? It would be on C2. So, the structure is:

COOCH3-C(H)(p-tolyl)-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, but that would make the ketone on C3, which was the position of the diol.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate, but that would require losing a carbon, which doesn't happen in the Pinacol rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the product is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. Let me imagine that structure:

The structure would be:

COOCH3–C(O)–CH(CH3)–p-tolyl ?

Wait, no, that's not matching. Alternatively, the structure would be:

COOCH3–C(O)–CH(CH2-p-tolyl) ?

Hmm, not sure. Let me cross-check the options. 

Option C says B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate. That would be a three-carbon chain, with a ketone on C3, a methyl on C2, and a p-tolyl on C2.

Wait, but how would that form from the starting material with four carbons? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Pinacol rearrangement mechanism for the second reaction. The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)–CH(OH)(p-tolyl)–CH(OH)–CH3.

When acid is added, one of the OHs (say, on C3) gets protonated. Then, a hydride shift occurs from C2 to C3, forming a carbocation on C3. Then, the adjacent group (p-tolyl on C2) would form the ketone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the hydride shift occurs from C2 to C3, leading to a carbocation on C3. Then, the adjacent group (C3's substituent) could form a double bond, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement leads to the formation of a ketone on C2, with the p-tolyl group and a methyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate, but that would require losing a carbon, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which is option A.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option A for B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, putting it together, for the first reaction, option A's A is correct, and for the second reaction, B is option A's B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, in the first reaction, A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, and in the second reaction, B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, the correct option would be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option A: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Yes, that's option A.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate. So, the product after rearrangement is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, does that make sense?

The starting material is a four-carbon diol ester. After rearrangement, the product is a four-carbon ketone ester. So, the product would have the ketone at C3, with the p-tolyl at C2.

Wait, perhaps the structure after rearrangement is:

COOCH3 (C1) - CH2 (C2) - C(O) (C3) - CH3 (C4)

But with a p-tolyl group on C2. So, the product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, for the second reaction, the product is option A's B.

Therefore, the correct option is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves the conversion of a 1,2-diol into a ketone under acidic conditions, proceeding through protonation of one hydroxyl group and a subsequent 1,2-hydride shift. The problem consists of two reactions, and the goal is to determine the starting materials and products.

### Reaction 1: A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one  
The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, a cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on carbon 2 and a ketone at carbon 1. The starting material must be a 1,2-diol with two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. Based on the structure of the product, the starting material is **1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol**. This molecule has a cyclohexanol ring with a CH₂ group attached to carbon 1, which carries two p-tolyl groups and an additional hydroxyl group. Under acidic conditions, one hydroxyl group is protonated, followed by a hydride shift, leading to the formation of the ketone at carbon 1 and the two p-tolyl groups on carbon 2.

### Reaction 2: Methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B  
The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, a four-carbon ester with hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2. Under acidic conditions, one hydroxyl group is protonated, followed by a 1,2-hydride shift. This rearrangement leads to the formation of a ketone at carbon 2, with the p-tolyl group and other substituents rearranged. The product is **methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate**, a four-carbon ester with a ketone at carbon 3 and a p-tolyl group at carbon 2.

### Evaluation of Options  
- **Option A**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.  
  This matches the analysis for both reactions.  
- **Option B**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.  
  Incorrect because the starting material A is not a cyclopentanol derivative.  
- **Option C**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.  
  Incorrect because both A and B are wrong.  
- **Option D**: A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.  
  Incorrect because B is wrong.

### Final Answer  
The correct option is **A**, as it accurately identifies the starting materials and products for both reactions.  

**Answer: A**
