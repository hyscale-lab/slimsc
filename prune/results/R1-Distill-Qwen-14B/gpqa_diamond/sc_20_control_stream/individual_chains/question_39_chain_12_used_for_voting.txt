Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. They're asking for the numerical value of "a".

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a certain region is the integral of |ψ|^2 dx over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, that means the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must be 1 (since the total probability is 1).

Wait, but wait. The given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So this is a complex function. To find the probability density, I need to compute the square of its modulus.

The modulus squared of a complex number z = p + qi is p² + q². So in this case, p is a/sqrt(1+x), and q is -0.5. So |ψ|² would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)².

Wait, let me write that down:

ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i

So, ψ* is the complex conjugate, which is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Then, |ψ|² = ψ * ψ* = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5i)(-0.5i) ?

Wait, no, no. Wait, the product is:

(a / sqrt(1+x)) * (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (a / sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i - 0.5i * (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (-0.5i)(0.5i)

Wait, maybe it's easier to just compute [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms (the ones with i) would be imaginary and cancel out when multiplied as (p + qi)(p - qi) = p² + q².

So yes, |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25). 

But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me double-check: the modulus squared of a complex number is the product of the number and its conjugate. So ψ = A + B i, where A is a real part and B is the imaginary part.

So ψ* is A - B i. So ψ ψ* = A² + B². So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So A² is a²/(1+x), and B² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So yes, |ψ|² = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the wave function must be normalized, such that the integral of |ψ|² over all space is 1.

But in this problem, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|² dx must be 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when you square the modulus, you get (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. That would be (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

So I can set up the equation:

∫ from 1 to 3 [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Breaking it into two terms:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so the first term is a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second term: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the steps again because sometimes I might have missed something.

Wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|², it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: the problem says that all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must have zero probability outside of this interval. But in the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i; so when x approaches infinity, the first term tends to zero, but the imaginary part is a constant. That can't be right because the probability density would be 0.25 for x approaching infinity, which would imply a non-zero probability there. But the problem states that all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is only defined in that interval, and zero elsewhere?

Wait, the question states: each system's particle can exist in a part of space where this wave function applies. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. But the given wave function doesn't look like that; it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is for the part where it can exist. So perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem says that none of the particles were found outside x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside that region. But the given expression is only valid where it can exist, which is between 1 and 3.

But in that case, the wave function would be ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. So when we calculate the normalization integral, it's from 1 to 3.

So my previous calculation was correct.

So proceeding, we have a^2 ln(2) +0.5 =1. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213, so a≈0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me verify the calculation again.

Wait, let me compute a^2 ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Square root of 0.7213 is about 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So option B is 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where \( i \) is the imaginary unit. The probability density is proportional to the modulus squared of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). For a complex number \( \psi(x) = A + Bi \), the modulus squared is \( |\psi(x)|^2 = A^2 + B^2 \). Here, \( A = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and \( B = -0.5 \), so:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The total probability of finding the particle between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) must equal 1. Therefore, we set up the normalization condition:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right].
   \]

   Using \( \ln(4) = 2\ln(2) \), this simplifies to:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is closest to option **B) 0.85**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so the first term is a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second term: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.
