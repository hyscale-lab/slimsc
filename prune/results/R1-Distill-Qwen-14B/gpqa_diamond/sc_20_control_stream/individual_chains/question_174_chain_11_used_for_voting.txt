Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Oh wait, wait. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So the original mass was M, and after fission, the two fragments add up to 0.99M? That's interesting because the total mass is less than before, which I think is due to the energy released in the form of kinetic energy and maybe binding energy or something else. But since the problem says "nothing else" is produced, perhaps the mass deficit is converted into kinetic energy.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. They want the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in MeV, so I need to calculate the energies and find the difference.

First, let's figure out the masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So, m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the second equation: 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. Then, m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, wait. Because M is the initial mass. Wait, wait, no: the initial mass is M, and the sum of the fragments is 0.99 M. So the rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. So the mass of the two fragments is 0.99 M, and the original was M. So the mass defect is 0.01 M, which is converted into kinetic energy.

But in reality, the rest mass of the products is less than the parent, so the released energy is (0.01 M c²), but wait, the parent's rest energy is 300 GeV. Hmm. Let's see. Wait, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. The sum of the rest energies of the two fragments is 0.99 M c². So the initial rest energy is M c² = 300 GeV. So the sum of the fragments' rest energies is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV. Because 300 - 297 = 3 GeV.

But wait, that's the total energy available to be converted into kinetic energy and other forms. Since the problem states that the fragments are the only products, that energy (3 GeV) must be the kinetic energy of the two fragments. Because in fission, the energy comes from the mass defect, which is converted into kinetic energy and other things like neutrinos or gamma rays, but the problem says nothing else, so I think we can assume all the 3 GeV is their kinetic energy.

Wait, but in reality, some energy is carried away by other particles, but the problem says "nothing else," so all the energy goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. So total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But wait, wait again. Because in the rest frame of the nucleus, when it splits into two fragments, they must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the total momentum is zero, as before.

So the kinetic energy of the two fragments should add up to 3 GeV.

So, let me model this. Let me denote:

m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. Wait, wait, no: M is the initial mass. The sum m1 + m2 is 0.99 M. So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. But the initial rest mass is M. So m1 and m2 are fractions of M.

But since the problem says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M," so yes, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So m1 is (2/3) * 0.99 M ≈ 0.66 M, as I thought. So the more massive fragment is m1, and the lighter is m2.

Now, the two fragments are moving with velocities such that their momenta cancel each other. Let me denote their velocities as v1 and v2. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. So:

m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, because momentum is a vector. So if m1 is moving to the right with velocity v1 and m2 to the left with velocity v2, their momenta magnitudes are |p1| = m1 v1, |p2| = m2 v2. So for momentum conservation, because the initial momentum was zero, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, but actually, the direction matters. Let me denote v1 to the right, so v2 is to the left, so the momentum of m2 would be negative. So m1 v1 - m2 v2 = 0 → m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So, v2 = (m1 / m2) v1.

But since m1 = 2 m2, v2 = (2 m2/m2) v1 → v2 = 2 v1.

Wait, but that would mean that the lighter fragment is moving faster. That makes sense because for the same momentum, lighter mass needs higher velocity.

So, now, we can compute the kinetic energies. The kinetic energy of each fragment will be (1/2) m v² for non-relativistic case, but relativistic case is different.

But the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So T1 (more massive) + T2 (less massive) = 3 GeV.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation of T1.

So first, I need to compute the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical T1, and find T1_correct - T1_classical.

Alternatively, the question says, "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" So, it's T1_correct - T1_classical.

But perhaps it's the other way around? No, the question is correct minus the approximated.

So, let's proceed.

First, the classical (non-relativistic) approach.

In the classical case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v² for each fragment.

In the classical case, since the momentum is conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments are equal and opposite.

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

As before, m1 = 2 m2 → v2 = 2 v1.

So, the kinetic energy of m1 is (1/2) m1 v1², and kinetic energy of m2 is (1/2) m2 v2².

So, substituting v2 = 2 v1:

T_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 (2 v1)²

= (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 * 4 v1²

= (1/2) m1 v1² + 2 m2 v1²

But since m1 = 2 m2,

= (1/2)(2 m2) v1² + 2 m2 v1²

= (m2 v1²) + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1².

And the total kinetic energy is T_nonrel = 3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

I need to find the velocity v1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of variables.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find the velocities using the non-relativistic approach. Let's proceed.

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, the mass is m, and velocity is v.

But perhaps it's better to express the kinetic energies in terms of the mass and the velocity. Alternatively, maybe I can find the velocity from the momentum.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote the momentum p = m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So,

p = m1 v1 = m2 v2.

From m1 = 2 m2,

p = 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

So, v2 = 2 v1.

The kinetic energy for each fragment is (p²)/(2 m), because KE = (p²)/(2m).

So, T1 (for m1) is p²/(2 m1) = p²/(2*(2 m2)) ) = p²/(4 m2).

Similarly, T2 (for m2) is p²/(2 m2).

So, total KE is T1 + T2 = (p²/(4 m2)) + (p²/(2 m2)) ) = ( (1/4) + (1/2) ) p²/(m2) ) = (3/4) p²/m2.

And this equals 3 GeV.

So,

(3/4) (p²/m2) ) = 3 GeV → p²/m2 = 4 GeV.

So,

p² = 4 GeV * m2.

But p = m1 v1 = 2 m2 v1 → p = 2 m2 v1.

So, p² = 4 m2² v1².

Substitute into p² = 4 GeV m2:

4 m2² v1² =4 GeV m2 → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

Which is the same as before.

So, m2 v1² =1 GeV.

But I need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1_nonrel.

T1_nonrel = p²/(4 m2) = (4 m2² v1²) / (4 m2) )= m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

Wait, that's interesting. So in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV, and T2 is 2 GeV. Because T1 + T2 =3 GeV. So yeah, 1 +2=3.

So, T1_nonrel is 1 GeV.

Now, let's compute T1 in the relativistic case.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by T = (γ -1) m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, for each fragment, T1 = (γ1 -1) m1 c², and T2 = (γ2 -1) m2 c².

And since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum is zero, so the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. So,

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But also, from the velocity relation, v2 = 2 v1 (from earlier, in non-relativistic case, but wait does that hold in relativistic case? Probably not, because velocities don't add linearly. Hmm. That complicates things.)

Wait, maybe it's better to model using energy and momentum conservation.

The initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV.

The final energy is the sum of the two fragments' rest energies plus their kinetic energies. So,

E1 + E2 = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2) ) = (m1 + m2) c² + (T1 + T2) ) = 0.99 M c² + 3 GeV.

Which equals (0.99 M c² + 3 GeV) → which should equal the initial energy: M c².

So,

0.99 M c² +3 GeV = M c² → 3 GeV = 0.01 M c² → M c² = 300 GeV as given. So that's consistent.

So, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

But to find the individual kinetic energies, we need to use relativistic equations.

Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. Since they move in opposite directions, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so:

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2,

γ1 (2 m2) v1 = γ2 m2 v2 → 2 γ1 v1 = γ2 v2.

Also, from the velocity in the center of momentum frame, but wait, no, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the fragments are moving in opposite directions.

Moreover, the total energy is conserved, so:

E1 + E2 = M c² → (γ1 m1 c²) + (γ2 m2 c²) ) = M c².

So,

γ1 (2 m2) c² + γ2 (m2) c² = 300 GeV.

But m2 = (0.99 M)/(3) = 0.33 M. Wait, no. Wait, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so m2 = (0.99 M - m1). But I think it's better to express everything in terms of M.

Wait, initial mass is M, so m1 = (2/3)(0.99 M) = 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

So,

γ1 (0.66 M) c² + γ2 (0.33 M) c² = 300 GeV.

Divide both sides by M c²:

0.66 γ1 + 0.33 γ2 = 300 GeV / (M c²) → but M c² is 300 GeV, so 300 GeV/(300 GeV) =1.

So,

0.66 γ1 + 0.33 γ2 = 1.

Dividing both sides by 0.33,

2 γ1 + γ2 = 3.0303... → equation (1).

And from momentum:

2 γ1 v1 = γ2 v2 → equation (2).

Wait, but we need another equation relating v1 and v2. Perhaps using the fact that in the rest frame of the nucleus, the fragments have velocities v1 and v2 in opposite directions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe using the relation between velocities. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the velocities in terms of the gamma factors.

Wait, the velocity v is related to gamma via:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But perhaps it's easier to express v in terms of beta, where beta = v/c.

So, beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

Then,

γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta1²).

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta2²).

So, the momentum equation becomes:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So,

2 (gamma1 beta1) = gamma2 beta2 → equation (2a).

But the gamma beta terms are the terms in the momentum expressions.

So, equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Equation (2a): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

And the energy equation is equation (1).

Wait, but I think this might get complicated. Perhaps I can make an assumption that v1 is much smaller than c, but that's the non-relativistic case. But we've already done that.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the velocities might not be that small, so the non-relativistic approach might not hold, so the kinetic energy would be higher than the classical calculation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the energies. The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is much less than 300 GeV, so perhaps the velocities are non-relativistic. Hmm, because 3 GeV compared to 300 GeV is 1% of the rest energy. So, each fragment's KE is small, so maybe their speeds are non-relativistic, making the classical approximation a good one. But the problem is asking about the difference between the correct (relativistic) and the classical T1.

So, perhaps the velocities are non-relativistic, but perhaps the mass ratio affects it. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energies are small, so T1 << m1 c², so the gamma factor is approximately 1 + T1/(m1 c²), using the approximation that for small T, gamma ≈ 1 + T/(m c²).

So, let's try that.

In the non-relativistic case, T1_nonrel =1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, T1_rel = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

But m1 c² is 0.66 M c² = 0.66 *300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So, T1_rel = (gamma1 -1)*198 GeV.

From the energy equation,

gamma1 *0.66 M c² + gamma2 *0.33 M c² = M c².

Divide both sides by M c²,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1 → equation (1).

And from the momentum,

gamma1 *0.66 M v1 = gamma2 *0.33 M v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But v2 = 2 v1 in the non-relativistic case, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, we found that T1 is 1 GeV, but in the relativistic case, gamma is slightly larger than 1, leading to a slightly larger kinetic energy. So, the difference would be small, perhaps a few MeV.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I can make an approximation.

Let me assume that the kinetic energies are much smaller than the rest masses, so gamma is approximately 1 + T/(m c²).

So, gamma1 ≈1 + T1/(m1 c²).

Similarly, gamma2 ≈ 1 + T2/(m2 c²).

But T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

So,

gamma1 ≈1 + T1/(198 GeV) → since m1 c²=198 GeV.

gamma2≈1 + T2/(99 GeV) → since m2 c²=99 GeV (because m2=0.33 M, M c²=300 GeV, so 0.33 *300=99 GeV.

So, substituting into equation (1):

0.66 (1 + T1/(198 GeV)) + 0.33 (1 + T2/(99 GeV)) ) =1.

Simplify,

0.66 + 0.66 T1/(198) + 0.33 + 0.33 T2/(99) =1.

Adding 0.66 and 0.33, we get 0.99.

So,

0.99 + [0.66 T1/(198)] + [0.33 T2/(99)] =1.

Subtract 0.99:

[0.66 T1/(198)] + [0.33 T2/(99)] =0.01.

Simplify the terms:

0.66/198 = (66/198)= (1/3) → 0.033333...

Wait, 66 /198 =1/3 → 0.333... So,

0.66 T1/198 → T1 * (0.66)/(198) = T1 * (1/300).

Similarly, 0.33 T2/(99) → 0.33/99 = (1/300).

So,

(T1 + T2)/300 =0.01.

But T1 + T2=3 GeV.

So,

3 GeV /300 = 0.01 GeV.

Which is 0.01 GeV = 10 MeV. But 3/300 is 0.01, but that's 10 MeV? Wait, 3 GeV is 3000 MeV. 3000 MeV /300=10 MeV. So,

10 MeV =0.01 GeV=10 MeV=0.01 *1000 MeV=10 MeV.

Wait, but 0.01 GeV is 10 MeV.

But according to the equation, (T1 + T2)/300 =0.01 GeV → 3 GeV /300 =0.01 GeV, which is correct.

So, this brings us back. So, this approximation doesn't help us find T1 and T2. Because it's just the same equation.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are small, so we can use the non-relativistic approach but correct for the relativistic terms.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, we have T1=1 GeV, and T2=2 GeV.

But in reality, the masses are moving, so their kinetic energies are a bit higher because of relativistic effects.

Wait, but how much higher?

Wait, perhaps we can model this with a better approximation. Let's consider that for small velocities, gamma is approx 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, gamma ≈1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, kinetic energy is T = (gamma -1) m c² = (v²)/(2 c²) * m c² = (1/2) m v², which is the classical result.

But in reality, the velocities might be such that (v/c)² is not negligible, so the correction is needed.

But how to find it.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the kinetic energy. The non-relativistic approximation gives T1=1 GeV, but the actual T1 is higher because of relativistic effects.

But how much higher?

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem using the exact relativistic approach, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the kinetic energies are small compared to the rest mass, so that the gamma factor is approximately 1 + T/(m c²).

Wait, but I think that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the two fragments' velocities are such that their momenta are equal and opposite, and use the relativistic relation for momentum and energy.

But perhaps it's better to write the equations in terms of beta (v/c) and gamma.

Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

So, the momentum equation is:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

And the energy equation is:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c² =300 GeV.

And the sum of kinetic energies: (gamma1-1) m1 c² + (gamma2-1) m2 c² =3 GeV.

So,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 =300 GeV / c² → 300 GeV/c² is M.

So,

gamma1 * 0.66 M + gamma2 *0.33 M = M → 0.66 gamma1 +0.33 gamma2 =1 → equation (1).

Momentum equation: gamma1 *0.66 M * beta1 = gamma2 *0.33 M * beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2 → equation (2).

Kinetic energy sum: (gamma1 -1)*0.66 M c² + (gamma2 -1)*0.33 M c² =3 GeV.

But 0.66 M c² =0.66 *300 GeV =198 GeV.

0.33 M c² =99 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1)*198 + (gamma2 -1)*99 =3 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 -198 -99 =3 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =300.

But from equation (1),

0.66 gamma1 +0.33 gamma2 =1 → multiply by 99 * 3 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 = 300.

Which is the same as the equation above. So, I can't get any new information. Hmm, so it's consistent.

I need another equation to solve for gamma1 and gamma2.

Wait, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1 using equation (2).

Equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2 → beta2 = (2 gamma1 beta1)/gamma2.

But I also have the energy equation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma1 and beta1.

Wait, but it's getting complicated. Maybe I can make an assumption that beta2 = 2 beta1, similar to the non-relativistic case. Let's see if that holds.

In non-relativistic case, v2=2 v1 → beta2=2 beta1.

If this holds in the relativistic case, then beta2=2 beta1.

But perhaps that's not the case because velocities don't add linearly.

But let's test this assumption.

Assume beta2=2 beta1.

Then, equation (2): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 (2 beta1) → 2 gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta1 → gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma1=gamma2=gamma.

So, equation (1): 0.66 gamma + 0.33 gamma =1 → (0.99 gamma) =1 → gamma=100/99 ≈1.0101.

So, gamma≈1.0101.

So, beta= v/c ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2= (100/99)^2≈1.0204.

So, 1/gamma^2=0.9803 → 1 - 0.9803=0.0197.

So, beta ≈ sqrt(0.0197)≈0.1404.

So, beta≈0.14.

So, v≈0.14 c.

But wait, if beta2=2 beta1, then beta2=0.28 c.

Now, check if this holds.

So, with gamma1=gamma2=1.0101,

gamma1=1.0101,

beta1≈0.1404,

beta2≈0.2808.

But from equation (2), 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2 → 2 *1.0101 *0.1404 ≈ 0.283 ≈1.0101 *0.2808 ≈0.283. So, yes, holds.

So, this assumption works.

So, with beta2=2 beta1, we have gamma1=gamma2=100/99.

Now, compute T1.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c² = (100/99 -1) *198 GeV = (1/99)*198 GeV = 2 GeV.

Wait, that's interesting. Because in the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV, but with this assumption, T1 is 2 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the kinetic energies would be 2 GeV + (gamma2-1)*99 GeV.

But gamma2=1.0101, so (gamma2-1)=0.0101.

(0.0101)*99 GeV≈1 GeV.

So, T1=2 GeV, T2≈1 GeV. Sum is 3 GeV, which matches.

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV, but according to this, the correct T1 is 2 GeV. So the difference would be 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV.

So, this approach must be wrong.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in assuming beta2=2 beta1. Because in reality, the velocities can't be that straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption beta2=2 beta1 is incorrect in the relativistic case.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, yes, but in relativistic, the relationship between velocities is not linear.

So, perhaps I should not make that assumption.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that in the relativistic case, the velocities are such that the momentum equation holds, but without assuming beta2=2 beta1.

But without that assumption, it's hard to solve the equations.

So, perhaps I can write everything in terms of gamma1 and beta1.

From equation (2):

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But I can express beta2 in terms of beta1 and gamma ratio.

Alternatively, express beta2 = (2 gamma1 beta1) / gamma2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express equation (2) as:

gamma2 = (2 gamma1 beta1) / beta2.

And substitute into equation (1).

But then equation (1):

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 * [ (2 gamma1 beta1)/ beta2 ) ] =1.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps express beta in terms of gamma.

We know that beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So, beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

But equation (2) is:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Substituting beta1 and beta2,

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) = gamma2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe square both sides.

(2 gamma1)^2 (1 - 1/gamma1²) = gamma2² (1 - 1/gamma2²).

→ 4 gamma1² (1 -1/gamma1² ) = gamma2² (1 -1/gamma2² )

Simplify left side:

4 gamma1² -4.

Right side: gamma2² -1.

So,

4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1 → gamma2² =4 gamma1² -3.

Now, from equation (1):

0.66 gamma1 +0.33 gamma2 = 1.

So,

0.66 gamma1 +0.33 sqrt(4 gamma1² -3 ) =1.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in gamma1. It's tricky to solve without approximation.

Let me make an assumption that gamma1 is just a bit larger than 1. Let's let gamma1 = 1 + x, where x is small.

Then, gamma1² ≈1 + 2x.

So, 4 gamma1² ≈4(1+2x) =4 +8x.

So, gamma2²=4 gamma1² -3 ≈ (4 +8x) -3=1 +8x → gamma2≈sqrt(1+8x) ≈1 +4x.

So, equation (1):

0.66 (1 +x) +0.33 (1 +4x ) =1.

Expand:

0.66 +0.66 x +0.33 +1.32 x =1.

Add:

(0.66 +0.33 )=0.99,

(0.66x +1.32 x)=1.98 x.

So,

0.99 +1.98 x =1 → 1.98 x=0.01 → x=0.01/(1.98)≈0.00505.

So, gamma1=1 +0.00505≈1.00505.

So, gamma2≈1 +4 *0.00505=1.0202.

Now, let's compute gamma2 using the actual equation.

gamma2²=4 gamma1² -3.

gamma1≈1.00505 → gamma1²≈1.01015.

4 gamma1²=4.0406 → minus 3 →1.0406 → gamma2≈sqrt(1.0406)=1.0201.

Which matches our approximation.

Now, compute T1 and T2.

T1= (gamma1 -1) * m1 c² = (0.00505) *198 GeV≈1.00 GeV.

Wait, that's about 1 GeV, which is the same as the non-relativistic case.

But wait, the actual gamma is 1.00505, so T1= (0.00505) *198 GeV ≈1 GeV.

Similarly, T2=(gamma2 -1)*99 GeV= (0.0201)*99 GeV≈2 GeV.

So, T1≈1 GeV, T2≈2 GeV, sum 3 GeV.

Wait, but that's the same as the non-relativistic case.

So, the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1 is zero? But that's not possible because in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy should be higher than the non-relativistic case.

Hmm.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV, and in this approximation, T1 is also 1 GeV. So the difference would be zero, but that's not among the options.

But perhaps the approximation is not accurate enough.

Wait, let's compute more precisely.

Compute gamma1=1.00505.

So, gamma1²= (1.00505)^2= 1 + 2*0.00505 + (0.00505)^2 ≈1.01015 +0.0000255≈1.0101755.

So, 4 gamma1²=4.0407 → minus3 →1.0407.

So, gamma2²=1.0407 → gamma2= sqrt(1.0407)=1.02015.

So, T1= (1.00505 -1) *198 GeV=0.00505 *198=1.00 GeV.

T2= (1.02015-1) *99 GeV=0.02015 *99=2 GeV, approx.

So, T1 is the same.

But that's only with this approximation. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the velocities are such that the kinetic energies are not so close to the non-relativistic case. Maybe because the mass ratio is 2:1, the more massive fragment has a lower speed, so its gamma factor is closer to 1, making its KE more relativistic, but the lighter fragment's KE is more relativistic.

Wait, but in this case, the approximation suggests that the more massive fragment's T1 is about the same as non-relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual T1 is slightly larger than 1 GeV, and the difference is a few MeV.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

Compute T1= (gamma1 -1)*198 GeV.

gamma1=1.00505 → (gamma1 -1)=0.00505.

So, 0.00505 *198 GeV=1.00 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the approximation is correct up to 3 significant figures. But the options are in the MeV range, which is 10^-3 GeV.

So, perhaps the difference is about 5 MeV or so.

Wait, maybe I need a better approach.

Alternative approach: Let's consider the relativistic work done.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Maybe I can look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the rest masses and energies, and use the fact that in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero.

Wait, but the nucleus is initially at rest, so the center of mass frame is the same as the lab frame.

So, the fragments move in opposite directions with momenta p and p, where p is the magnitude.

So, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments.

E1 + E2 = M c².

E1 = gamma1 m1 c²,

E2=gamma2 m2 c².

So,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

But M = m1 + m2 + (mass defect) → which is 0.99 M + 0.01 M = M.

So,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

But m1 +m2=0.99 M.

So,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M → (gamma1 -1) m1 + (gamma2 -1) m2 = M - (m1 + m2) )=0.01 M.

But M is 300 GeV/c².

So,

(gamma1 -1) m1 + (gamma2 -1) m2 =0.01 M =3 GeV.

Which is the same as the sum of the kinetic energies.

So,

(gamma1 -1) *198 GeV + (gamma2 -1)*99 GeV =3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 3 GeV,

( (gamma1 -1) *66 + (gamma2 -1) *33 ) =1.

So,

66 (gamma1 -1) +33 (gamma2 -1) =1 → 66 gamma1 +33 gamma2 =1 +66 +33 =100 → equation (A).

From the momentum equation,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

We can write v in terms of beta.

v1 = beta1 c,

v2 = beta2 c.

So,

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

So,

gamma1 (0.66 M) beta1 = gamma2 (0.33 M) beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2 → equation (B).

So, equation (A): 66 gamma1 +33 gamma2 =100 → divide by 33: 2 gamma1 + gamma2=100/33≈3.0303.

Equation (B): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So, we have two equations, but four variables (gamma1, gamma2, beta1, beta2).

But we can express beta in terms of gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)),

beta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

Substituting into equation (B):

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)) = gamma2 sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2)).

Square both sides:

4 gamma1² (1 -1/gamma1^2) = gamma2² (1 -1/gamma2^2).

Simplify:

4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1 → 4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3 → equation (C).

From equation (A): 2 gamma1 + gamma2=100/33 → let me write it as gamma2= (100/33) -2 gamma1 → equation (D).

Substitute equation (D) into equation (C):

4 gamma1² - [ (100/33 - 2 gamma1 ) ]^2 =3.

Expand the square:

=4 gamma1² - [ (100/33)^2 - 2*(100/33)*(2 gamma1) + (2 gamma1)^2 ) ]=3.

Simplify term by term:

=4 gamma1² - [ (10000/1089) - (400 gamma1/33) +4 gamma1² ] =3.

So,

4 gamma1² -10000/1089 +400 gamma1/33 -4 gamma1² =3.

The 4 gamma1² and -4 gamma1² cancel.

So,

-10000/1089 +400 gamma1/33 =3.

Multiply both sides by 1089 to eliminate denominators:

-10000 +400 gamma1 *33 =3*1089.

Compute 400 *33=13,200.

3*1089=3,267.

So,

-10000 +13200 gamma1 =3267.

Rearrange,

13200 gamma1 = 3267 +10000=13267 → gamma1=13267/13200 ≈1.005075758.

So, gamma1≈1.0050758.

Now, compute gamma2 from equation (D): gamma2=100/33 -2 gamma1.

100/33≈3.030303.

2 gamma1≈2.0101517.

So,

gamma2≈3.030303 -2.0101517=1.0201513.

Now, compute beta1 and beta2.

beta1= sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²)=sqrt(1 -1/(1.0050758)^2 ).

Compute 1.0050758 squared: ≈1.010175.

So, 1/1.010175≈0.990088.

So, 1 -0.990088=0.009912.

sqrt(0.009912)≈0.09956.

So, beta1≈0.09956 c.

Similarly, beta2= sqrt(1 -1/gamma2²).

gamma2=1.0201513 → gamma2²=≈1.04076.

1/gamma2²≈0.9610.

1 -0.9610=0.039.

sqrt(0.039)=≈0.1975.

So, beta2≈0.1975 c.

Now, compute the kinetic energies.

T1= (gamma1 -1)*198 GeV.

gamma1=1.0050758 → (gamma1-1)=0.0050758.

So, T1=0.0050758 *198 ≈1.00 GeV.

Wait, that's exactly the same as the non-relativistic case.

But wait, let's compute it more precisely.

198 *0.0050758=198 *0.005 is 0.99 GeV, and 198 *0.0000758= approx 0.015 GeV.

So, T1≈0.99 +0.015=1.005 GeV.

T1≈1.005 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 was exactly 1 GeV.

So, the difference is T1_rel - T1_nonrel =0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

Ah, so the difference is 5 MeV. So the correct answer is B)5 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in both the relativistic and non-relativistic cases, then find the difference between the two.

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV.
- After fission, the two fragments have rest masses such that:
  - The more massive fragment has mass \( m_1 = 0.66M \).
  - The lighter fragment has mass \( m_2 = 0.33M \).
  - The total rest mass of the fragments is \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).
- The total energy released in the fission is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Non-Relativistic Case
In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Using momentum conservation (\( m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 \)) and energy conservation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:

\[
T_{1,\text{non-rel}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \, \text{GeV} = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Case
In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by \( T = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Using energy and momentum conservation, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is slightly higher than the non-relativistic value. Detailed calculations show:

\[
T_{1,\text{rel}} \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Kinetic Energies
The difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies is:

\[
\Delta T = T_{1,\text{rel}} - T_{1,\text{non-rel}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the non-relativistic approximation is **5 MeV**.
