Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, that peak is probably a carbonyl group. For IR, 1720 is a strong indication of a ketone or maybe an ester or something similar. But considering the starting material is dibromide, and KOH is a strong base, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Oh wait, since it's KOH, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane...E2 would typically remove two adjacent leaving groups, but in this case, the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Adamantane's structure is quite rigid. So perhaps each Br is on a different bridgehead. I'm trying to visualize adamantane. I think in adamantane, each bridge is a CH2 group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons.

Wait, when KOH is used with vicinal dihalides (two adjacent X groups), it can lead to elimination to form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone via a neighboring group effect? Or perhaps it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's in the range for an ether's CH2 or maybe an alcohol's -OH, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Wait, 4.79 could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide. But the IR at 1720 is more likely a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. So each Br is removed, each with a base, to form a double bond. But 1,3 positions aren't adjacent, so elimination would form a diene? Or perhaps it's a geminal dihalide, but no, the starting material is 1,3.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a bridgehead. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from a bridgehead adjacent to each Br, then elimination would occur to form a ketone. Because when you eliminate from a bridgehead, sometimes you can form a carbonyl group. For example, in norbornene systems, similar eliminations happen.

Wait, another thought. When a dihalide is treated with KOH, sometimes it can undergo a double elimination to form an epoxide. But that requires a cyclic structure. Alternatively, since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone.

Wait, another angle: looking at the NMR. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Let me think about the NMR. A triplet at 4.79 could be a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Or perhaps a triplet arising from coupling with two neighboring protons.

Wait, but the IR is more telling. 1720 is definitely a carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone. So what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? If each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, perhaps elimination of two HBr molecules would form a ketone. Because when you have two halogens on adjacent bridgeheads, eliminating each HBr could bridge the carbonyl.

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, maybe each Br leaves and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, each bridgehead Br is removed, and that leads to a structure where a carbonyl is formed between those two bridgeheads.

So product 1 would be adamantanedione or something similar. But in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm peak is 2H. That doesn't fit with a ketone's carbonyl, which typically has no protons nearby. Wait, maybe I'm confused about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Let me think about the structure. If each bridgehead loses Br and forms a ketone, then perhaps the bridge becomes a carbonyl. So, maybe it's 1,3-adamantanedione. But then, what would the NMR look like?

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows 4.79 (2H). That seems like a CH2 group that's not part of the adamantane structure. Maybe it's part of a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with some adjacent substituents.

Wait, another approach: the initial product 1 is formed via an E2 elimination. If the two Br atoms are on bridgeheads, perhaps elimination forms a bridge with a double bond. But then, where's the carbonyl in the IR?

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double nucleophilic substitution, but that seems less likely.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a new ring. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, but that would probably require a strong base and high temperature.

Wait, considering that the product is a solid and has IR carbonyl, perhaps it's a diketone. If each bridgehead Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require each Br being on adjacent carbons, which they are not. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a single ketone group. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a ketone because each Br is eliminated, and the two adjacent bridgehead carbons form a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three other carbons. If two bridgeheads have Br, perhaps upon elimination, the two adjacent bridgeheads lose HBr each and form a carbonyl group.

Wait, if each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps removing each Br and a hydrogen from adjacent bridgehead carbons leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each bridgehead would lose HBr, but that would require a four-membered transition state, which might be possible in adamantane's rigid structure. The result would be a carbonyl group between those two bridgeheads, making a ketone.

So product 1 would be a ketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, the NMR would show a peak for the carbonyl. But wait, carbonyl carbons don't have protons, so the NMR would show the surrounding protons. So the peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H is likely a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in 1,3-adamantanedione, the structure is such that each bridgehead has a carbonyl. So, perhaps the two carbonyl groups are connected in a way that the adjacent CH2 groups are equivalent. So maybe the 4.79 ppm peak is for two equivalent CH2 groups next to the carbonyl.

So product 1 is likely an adamantane with two ketone groups, but perhaps it's not a dione. Alternatively, maybe each Br is removed, and the adjacent bridgeheads form a single ketone, but that would require the two bridgeheads to be connected in a way that allows a single carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone where the two bridgeheads have lost their Br and formed a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is such that two bridgeheads each lose HBr, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: considering the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let me think of possible structures. Maybe the product is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a meta-diketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Let me think about the reaction mechanism. KOH (a strong base) abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, with two Br atoms, perhaps two E2 eliminations occur, each abstracting a β-hydrogen, leading to two double bonds. But that would require a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't show a peak that matches a diene.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diene, but the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, not a diene. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide, so I don't think that's possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the heating with KOH leads to a nucleophilic substitution, but with two Br atoms, maybe each substitution occurs on adjacent carbons, leading to a carbonyl. For example, each Br is replaced by a hydroxide, which then loses water to form a ketone. But that would require two substitution steps, which may not be feasible at high temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone, and the 4.79 ppm peak is from the adjacent CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is an adamantane with a ketone group, and the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl are showing up as a triplet.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of product 1. 4.79 ppm is a triplet (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 2.41-2.23 region is probably from the adamantane ring protons, since they are typically around 1.5-2.5 ppm. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

So putting this together, product 1 is likely a monoketone. Let me imagine the structure: after elimination of two HBr molecules, a carbonyl group is formed. So, perhaps the two bridgehead Brs are replaced by a carbonyl group, making a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ketone? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridgehead ketone, such as in norbornene systems. For example, in norbornene, elimination can form a ketone.

Wait, norbornene systems: when norbornene is treated with a strong base, it can form a ketone via elimination. So perhaps in adamantane, the same process forms a ketone. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione? Or maybe a single ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridged ketone, where the two bridgehead Brs are removed, and a single ketone is formed between them.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the next step.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but no, the IR indicates a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement or another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but the IR at 1720 is a ketone, not an epoxide (which would have an absorbance around 1250-1300 cm-¹ for the C-O stretch). So product 1 is a ketone.

So what reaction occurs when a ketone is treated with Al(OiPr)3? Hmm. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires aromatic rings, but if product 1 is a ketone without an aromatic ring, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it or for some ring-expansion.

Wait, another idea: perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a Claisen or aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which forms a ketone oxide (lactone if cyclic), but I'm not certain.

Wait, the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation typically requires a ketone and a peracid, but Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's part of some Friedel-Crafts acylation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is formed via some cycloaddition. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the third step, which is ozonolysis. Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, and when ozonolysis is done, it breaks into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But wait, the starting material for ozonolysis is product 2, which came from product 1 treated with Al(OiPr)3. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, let me think: product 1 is a ketone. If product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes ring-opening to form an enol ether or some alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used in some elimination to form an alkene. But product 1 is already a ketone; perhaps product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone without a double bond, treatment with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 might induce a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, and treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes a cyclization to form a ring with a double bond. For example, if product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione, perhaps heating with Al(OiPr)3 could cause it to lose CO2 and form a cyclic structure with a double bond.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond.

Wait, another thought. If product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps treatment with Al(OiPr)3 leads to the formation of an enol, but without a base, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, not an acyl chloride.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Product 1's NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a peak at 1720. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone with a neighboring CH2 group. Let's say the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl, leading to a triplet in the NMR due to coupling with two other protons.

Wait, but what about the splitting pattern? If the 4.79 ppm peak is a triplet, that means each of those 2H is coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

So perhaps product 1 is a structure where the CH2 group is next to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons. So the triplet arises because each proton in the CH2 is coupling with two protons on adjacent groups.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, because ozonolysis is used on it to form product 3. So product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded protons are typically near electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyl groups. So in product 3, these protons would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl.

In ozonolysis, a double bond is cleaved to form two carbonyl groups. So if the double bond in product 2 was between carbons A and B, product 3 would have carbonyl groups on A and B.

The NMR of product 3 would then show protons adjacent to these carbonyl groups. The most deshielded would be the ones closest to the carbonyls.

Now, regarding the coupling pattern. The splitting depends on the neighboring protons. So if a proton is next to a CH2 group, it might couple with two protons, leading to a triplet. Or if it's next to a CH group with more protons, it might have a more complex splitting.

Wait, in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl group is attached to a chain. Let's say the double bond in product 2 was between two methylene groups. Then, after ozonolysis, each carbonyl would be attached to a CH2 group. So the protons on those CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyl.

Each of these CH2 groups would have two protons. Each proton on a CH2 next to a carbonyl would be split by neighboring protons. Let's say the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2. So each proton on the CH2 would couple with two protons from adjacent groups.

Wait, but how would the splitting work? Let's say we have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would each have two protons. Each of these protons would be split by the neighboring CH2 group.

Each CH2 would have two neighboring Hs. For example, the H on the first CH2 would be next to the Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent), and perhaps another set from another group.

Wait, let me think of a more concrete example. Suppose product 2 is an alkene like CH2=CH-... but in this case, product 2 comes from product 1, which is a ketone. So maybe product 2 is a cyclic alkene or a substituted alkene derived from product 1.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone), which upon ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an α,β-unsaturated ketone would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyls. For example, something like CH2=CH-C(=O)-R would become two fragments, each with a carbonyl.

But let me think about the structure of product 3. If the double bond was between two carbonyl groups, then ozonolysis would break it, but that's not possible because that would mean the double bond is between two carbonyls. Alternatively, product 2 might have a double bond in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyls, but I'm not sure how that would affect the NMR.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone, and the most deshielded H is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So the coupling would depend on the neighboring Hs.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded H in product 3 is likely to be part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So the Hs on that CH2 would be split by neighboring Hs.

If the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be split into a triplet. Because each H is next to two Hs (on the same CH2) and perhaps another set. Wait, but in a typical CH2-CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are other couplings, like with another group, the splitting could become more complex.

Wait, but if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is part of a chain, then each H on the first CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is something like (CH2)2(C=O) and (C=O)(CH2)2. So each end would have a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Each CH2 group would have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent) and perhaps another set from the next CH2 group.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps another two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, but each H on a CH2 is adjacent to the two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, but that's usually negligible in 1H NMR as geminal protons are equivalent and splitting isn't observed), and also to the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (vicinal coupling).

So each H on a CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So in the NMR, each H on the CH2 would show as a triplet. But wait, in this specific case, each CH2 is flanked by two carbonyls, so the CH2 group is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So each CH2 is between two carbonyls. The Hs on each CH2 would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in reality, each H on a CH2 is coupled with two Hs (on the adjacent CH2), so the splitting would be a triplet.

But wait, each H on the central CH2 (if any) would have more neighbors. Wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each of the CH2 groups has two Hs. The Hs on the first CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs on the second CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, each CH2 group is connected to another CH2 group. So the Hs on the first CH2 (let's say positions 1 and 2) are adjacent to Hs on the second CH2 (positions 3 and 4). Each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the second CH2. So each H would have a coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So in the NMR, each CH2 would appear as a triplet. But wait, this is a symmetric structure, so both CH2 groups would have the same chemical shift, and each would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the ones nearest to the carbonyl group. So those would be the Hs on the CH2 closest to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in this structure, all four Hs on the CH2 groups are equivalent, so they'd all give the same triplet.

But wait, in the problem, the options are about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, which would be those adjacent to the carbonyl. So assuming each of these Hs is coupled to two Hs from the adjacent CH2, their splitting would be a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think again.

If product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, perhaps product 3 is a dialdehyde or something similar. But ozonolysis of an internal double bond typically gives two carbonyl groups. So if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, the product would be two aldehyde or ketone groups, depending on substitution.

Wait, but product 3's NMR would have the most deshielded Hs as those adjacent to the carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is O=CH-CH2-C=O, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps O=C-CH2-CHO. No, that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: if product 2 is a cyclic alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two ketones or aldehydes. For example, a cyclopropane ring with a double bond would open up upon ozonolysis.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into a diketone. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would ozonolyze to two aldehydes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to product 1: after the first reaction, it's a ketone. Then, reaction with Al(OiPr)3 gives product 2, which is an alkene. Then ozonolysis of the alkene gives product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an α,β-unsaturated ketone would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-C(=O)-R, ozonolysis would break the double bond, giving two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me make a structure. Suppose product 2 is CH2=CH-Ad (where Ad is adamantane or a substituent). Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two CH2 groups with carbonyls.

So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. The Hs on these CH2 groups would be adjacent to the carbonyl, making them deshielded.

Each of these CH2 groups would have two Hs, each coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO, then the Hs on the CH2 would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (if any) and the aldehyde Hs. No, wait, the aldehyde Hs are on a carbonyl, so they don't have adjacent Hs for coupling in the same way.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So each CH2 is flanked by carbonyls. Each H on the central CH2 would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2, but in reality, each CH2 is only connected to one other CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So each CH2 is between two carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2, but those are geminal and don't split each other. They would also be adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2, leading to coupling.

So each H on the CH2 is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Thus, in the NMR, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls (on the CH2 groups) would be triplets.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded Hs, which would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups. So their coupling would be a triplet, making the answer A) triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but let me think again. If the CH2 group is between two carbonyls, each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (but geminal, no splitting) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

So yes, the coupling would be a triplet. Therefore, the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C leads to the elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, triplet for 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the product is a ketone with a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl, likely 1,3-adamantanedione.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Treating the ketone with aluminum isopropoxide likely forms an α,β-unsaturated ketone (an enone). This is a common reaction where the Lewis acid facilitates the removal of a proton β to the carbonyl group, forming a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of the α,β-unsaturated ketone cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) would have CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyls. The most deshielded protons in the NMR are those on these CH₂ groups, as they are near electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern**:  
   Each proton on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is coupled with the two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group. This results in a triplet splitting pattern for the most deshielded protons.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, that peak is probably a carbonyl group. For IR, 1720 is a strong indication of a ketone or maybe an ester or something similar. But considering the starting material is dibromide, and KOH is a strong base, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Oh wait, since it's KOH, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane...E2 would typically remove two adjacent leaving groups, but in this case, the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Adamantane's structure is quite rigid. So perhaps each Br is on a different bridgehead. I'm trying to visualize adamantane. I think in adamantane, each bridge is a CH2 group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons.

Wait, when KOH is used with vicinal dihalides (two adjacent X groups), it can lead to elimination to form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone via a neighboring group effect? Or perhaps it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's in the range for an ether's CH2 or maybe an alcohol's -OH, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Wait, 4.79 could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide. But the IR at 1720 is more likely a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. So each Br is removed, each with a base, to form a double bond. But 1,3 positions aren't adjacent, so elimination would form a diene? Or perhaps it's a geminal dihalide, but no, the starting material is 1,3.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a bridgehead. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from a bridgehead adjacent to each Br, then elimination would occur to form a ketone. Because when you eliminate from a bridgehead, sometimes you can form a carbonyl group. For example, in norbornene systems, similar eliminations happen.

Wait, another thought. When a dihalide is treated with KOH, sometimes it can undergo a double elimination to form an epoxide. But that requires a cyclic structure. Alternatively, since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone.

Wait, another angle: looking at the NMR. The product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an epoxide, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Let me think about the NMR. A triplet at 4.79 could be a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Or perhaps a triplet arising from coupling with two neighboring protons.

Wait, but the IR is more telling. 1720 is definitely a carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone. So what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? If each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, perhaps elimination of two HBr molecules would form a ketone. Because when you have two halogens on adjacent bridgeheads, eliminating each HBr could bridge the carbonyl.

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, maybe each Br leaves and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, each bridgehead Br is removed, and that leads to a structure where a carbonyl is formed between those two bridgeheads.

So product 1 would be adamantanedione or something similar. But in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm peak is 2H. That doesn't fit with a ketone's carbonyl, which typically has no protons nearby. Wait, maybe I'm confused about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Let me think about the structure. If each bridgehead loses Br and forms a ketone, then perhaps the bridge becomes a carbonyl. So, maybe it's 1,3-adamantanedione. But then, what would the NMR look like?

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows 4.79 (2H). That seems like a CH2 group that's not part of the adamantane structure. Maybe it's part of a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with some adjacent substituents.

Wait, another approach: the initial product 1 is formed via an E2 elimination. If the two Br atoms are on bridgeheads, perhaps elimination forms a bridge with a double bond. But then, where's the carbonyl in the IR?

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double nucleophilic substitution, but that seems less likely.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a new ring. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, but that would probably require a strong base and high temperature.

Wait, considering that the product is a solid and has IR carbonyl, perhaps it's a diketone. If each bridgehead Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require each Br being on adjacent carbons, which they are not. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a single ketone group. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a ketone because each Br is eliminated, and the two adjacent bridgehead carbons form a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three other carbons. If two bridgeheads have Br, perhaps upon elimination, the two adjacent bridgeheads lose HBr each and form a carbonyl group.

Wait, if each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps removing each Br and a hydrogen from adjacent bridgehead carbons leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each bridgehead would lose HBr, but that would require a four-membered transition state, which might be possible in adamantane's rigid structure. The result would be a carbonyl group between those two bridgeheads, making a ketone.

So product 1 would be a ketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, the NMR would show a peak for the carbonyl. But wait, carbonyl carbons don't have protons, so the NMR would show the surrounding protons. So the peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H is likely a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in 1,3-adamantanedione, the structure is such that each bridgehead has a carbonyl. So, perhaps the two carbonyl groups are connected in a way that the adjacent CH2 groups are equivalent. So maybe the 4.79 ppm peak is for two equivalent CH2 groups next to the carbonyl.

So product 1 is likely an adamantane with two ketone groups, but perhaps it's not a dione. Alternatively, maybe each Br is removed, and the adjacent bridgeheads form a single ketone, but that would require the two bridgeheads to be connected in a way that allows a single carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone where the two bridgeheads have lost their Br and formed a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is such that two bridgeheads each lose HBr, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: considering the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let me think of possible structures. Maybe the product is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a meta-diketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Let me think about the reaction mechanism. KOH (a strong base) abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, with two Br atoms, perhaps two E2 eliminations occur, each abstracting a β-hydrogen, leading to two double bonds. But that would require a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't show a peak that matches a diene.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diene, but the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, not a diene. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide, so I don't think that's possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the heating with KOH leads to a nucleophilic substitution, but with two Br atoms, maybe each substitution occurs on adjacent carbons, leading to a carbonyl. For example, each Br is replaced by a hydroxide, which then loses water to form a ketone. But that would require two substitution steps, which may not be feasible at high temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single ketone, and the 4.79 ppm peak is from the adjacent CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is an adamantane with a ketone group, and the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl are showing up as a triplet.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of product 1. 4.79 ppm is a triplet (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 2.41-2.23 region is probably from the adamantane ring protons, since they are typically around 1.5-2.5 ppm. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

So putting this together, product 1 is likely a monoketone. Let me imagine the structure: after elimination of two HBr molecules, a carbonyl group is formed. So, perhaps the two bridgehead Brs are replaced by a carbonyl group, making a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ketone? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridgehead ketone, such as in norbornene systems. For example, in norbornene, elimination can form a ketone.

Wait, norbornene systems: when norbornene is treated with a strong base, it can form a ketone via elimination. So perhaps in adamantane, the same process forms a ketone. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione? Or maybe a single ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridged ketone, where the two bridgehead Brs are removed, and a single ketone is formed between them.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the next step.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but no, the IR indicates a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement or another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but the IR at 1720 is a ketone, not an epoxide (which would have an absorbance around 1250-1300 cm-¹ for the C-O stretch). So product 1 is a ketone.

So what reaction occurs when a ketone is treated with Al(OiPr)3? Hmm. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires aromatic rings, but if product 1 is a ketone without an aromatic ring, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it or for some ring-expansion.

Wait, another idea: perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a Claisen or aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which forms a ketone oxide (lactone if cyclic), but I'm not certain.

Wait, the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation typically requires a ketone and a peracid, but Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's part of some Friedel-Crafts acylation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, and product 2 is formed via some cycloaddition. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the third step, which is ozonolysis. Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, and when ozonolysis is done, it breaks into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But wait, the starting material for ozonolysis is product 2, which came from product 1 treated with Al(OiPr)3. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, let me think: product 1 is a ketone. If product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes ring-opening to form an enol ether or some alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used in some elimination to form an alkene. But product 1 is already a ketone; perhaps product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone without a double bond, treatment with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 might induce a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, and treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes a cyclization to form a ring with a double bond. For example, if product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione, perhaps heating with Al(OiPr)3 could cause it to lose CO2 and form a cyclic structure with a double bond.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond.

Wait, another thought. If product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps treatment with Al(OiPr)3 leads to the formation of an enol, but without a base, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, not an acyl chloride.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Product 1's NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a peak at 1720. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone with a neighboring CH2 group. Let's say the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl, leading to a triplet in the NMR due to coupling with two other protons.

Wait, but what about the splitting pattern? If the 4.79 ppm peak is a triplet, that means each of those 2H is coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

So perhaps product 1 is a structure where the CH2 group is next to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons. So the triplet arises because each proton in the CH2 is coupling with two protons on adjacent groups.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, because ozonolysis is used on it to form product 3. So product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded protons are typically near electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyl groups. So in product 3, these protons would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl.

In ozonolysis, a double bond is cleaved to form two carbonyl groups. So if the double bond in product 2 was between carbons A and B, product 3 would have carbonyl groups on A and B.

The NMR of product 3 would then show protons adjacent to these carbonyl groups. The most deshielded would be the ones closest to the carbonyls.

Now, regarding the coupling pattern. The splitting depends on the neighboring protons. So if a proton is next to a CH2 group, it might couple with two protons, leading to a triplet. Or if it's next to a CH group with more protons, it might have a more complex splitting.

Wait, in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl group is attached to a chain. Let's say the double bond in product 2 was between two methylene groups. Then, after ozonolysis, each carbonyl would be attached to a CH2 group. So the protons on those CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyl.

Each of these CH2 groups would have two protons. Each proton on a CH2 next to a carbonyl would be split by neighboring protons. Let's say the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2. So each proton on the CH2 would couple with two protons from adjacent groups.

Wait, but how would the splitting work? Let's say we have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would each have two protons. Each of these protons would be split by the neighboring CH2 group.

Each CH2 would have two neighboring Hs. For example, the H on the first CH2 would be next to the Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent), and perhaps another set from another group.

Wait, let me think of a more concrete example. Suppose product 2 is an alkene like CH2=CH-... but in this case, product 2 comes from product 1, which is a ketone. So maybe product 2 is a cyclic alkene or a substituted alkene derived from product 1.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone), which upon ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an α,β-unsaturated ketone would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyls. For example, something like CH2=CH-C(=O)-R would become two fragments, each with a carbonyl.

But let me think about the structure of product 3. If the double bond was between two carbonyl groups, then ozonolysis would break it, but that's not possible because that would mean the double bond is between two carbonyls. Alternatively, product 2 might have a double bond in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyls, but I'm not sure how that would affect the NMR.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone, and the most deshielded H is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So the coupling would depend on the neighboring Hs.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded H in product 3 is likely to be part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So the Hs on that CH2 would be split by neighboring Hs.

If the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be split into a triplet. Because each H is next to two Hs (on the same CH2) and perhaps another set. Wait, but in a typical CH2-CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are other couplings, like with another group, the splitting could become more complex.

Wait, but if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is part of a chain, then each H on the first CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is something like (CH2)2(C=O) and (C=O)(CH2)2. So each end would have a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Each CH2 group would have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent) and perhaps another set from the next CH2 group.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps another two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, but each H on a CH2 is adjacent to the two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, but that's usually negligible in 1H NMR as geminal protons are equivalent and splitting isn't observed), and also to the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (vicinal coupling).

So each H on a CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So in the NMR, each H on the CH2 would show as a triplet. But wait, in this specific case, each CH2 is flanked by two carbonyls, so the CH2 group is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So each CH2 is between two carbonyls. The Hs on each CH2 would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in reality, each H on a CH2 is coupled with two Hs (on the adjacent CH2), so the splitting would be a triplet.

But wait, each H on the central CH2 (if any) would have more neighbors. Wait, in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each of the CH2 groups has two Hs. The Hs on the first CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs on the second CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, each CH2 group is connected to another CH2 group. So the Hs on the first CH2 (let's say positions 1 and 2) are adjacent to Hs on the second CH2 (positions 3 and 4). Each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the second CH2. So each H would have a coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So in the NMR, each CH2 would appear as a triplet. But wait, this is a symmetric structure, so both CH2 groups would have the same chemical shift, and each would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the ones nearest to the carbonyl group. So those would be the Hs on the CH2 closest to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in this structure, all four Hs on the CH2 groups are equivalent, so they'd all give the same triplet.

But wait, in the problem, the options are about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, which would be those adjacent to the carbonyl. So assuming each of these Hs is coupled to two Hs from the adjacent CH2, their splitting would be a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think again.

If product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, perhaps product 3 is a dialdehyde or something similar. But ozonolysis of an internal double bond typically gives two carbonyl groups. So if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, the product would be two aldehyde or ketone groups, depending on substitution.

Wait, but product 3's NMR would have the most deshielded Hs as those adjacent to the carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is O=CH-CH2-C=O, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps O=C-CH2-CHO. No, that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: if product 2 is a cyclic alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two ketones or aldehydes. For example, a cyclopropane ring with a double bond would open up upon ozonolysis.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into a diketone. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would ozonolyze to two aldehydes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to product 1: after the first reaction, it's a ketone. Then, reaction with Al(OiPr)3 gives product 2, which is an alkene. Then ozonolysis of the alkene gives product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an α,β-unsaturated ketone would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-C(=O)-R, ozonolysis would break the double bond, giving two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me make a structure. Suppose product 2 is CH2=CH-Ad (where Ad is adamantane or a substituent). Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two CH2 groups with carbonyls.

So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. The Hs on these CH2 groups would be adjacent to the carbonyl, making them deshielded.

Each of these CH2 groups would have two Hs, each coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO, then the Hs on the CH2 would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (if any) and the aldehyde Hs. No, wait, the aldehyde Hs are on a carbonyl, so they don't have adjacent Hs for coupling in the same way.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So each CH2 is flanked by carbonyls. Each H on the central CH2 would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2, but in reality, each CH2 is only connected to one other CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So each CH2 is between two carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2, but those are geminal and don't split each other. They would also be adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2, leading to coupling.

So each H on the CH2 is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Thus, in the NMR, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls (on the CH2 groups) would be triplets.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded Hs, which would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups. So their coupling would be a triplet, making the answer A) triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but let me think again. If the CH2 group is between two carbonyls, each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (but geminal, no splitting) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet.

So yes, the coupling would be a triplet. Therefore, the answer is A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C leads to the elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, triplet for 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the product is a ketone with a CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl, likely 1,3-adamantanedione.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Treating the ketone with aluminum isopropoxide likely forms an α,β-unsaturated ketone (an enone). This is a common reaction where the Lewis acid facilitates the removal of a proton β to the carbonyl group, forming a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of the α,β-unsaturated ketone cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) would have CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyls. The most deshielded protons in the NMR are those on these CH₂ groups, as they are near electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern**:  
   Each proton on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is coupled with the two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group. This results in a triplet splitting pattern for the most deshielded protons.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
