Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity relates to whether a compound has chiral centers, meaning they're not superimposable on their mirror images. But wait, there are some exceptions too, like if the compound has a plane of symmetry or if the chiral centers are in a way that they cancel each other out. 

Let me look at each compound one by one. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many are optically active. 

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**. Wait, so the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, wait, no. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon are Cl on C1, and on C2, there's a methyl group and the other substituents. Wait, but for a double bond, each carbon can have two substituents. So for C1, it's Cl and CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Let me count the substituents: C1 has Cl and the double bond. So on C1, the substituents are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2). Wait, maybe it's (Z) configuration, but the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, but C1 has Cl, a double bond, and two other substituents? No, wait, in an alkene, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2CH3 group. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, no, butene is four carbons. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl and the double bond (which counts as a substituent?), and on C2, a methyl and another CH2CH3. Wait, but for a double bond, each carbon is attached to two other carbons. So for C1, it's Cl and the double bond. Wait, but in this case, the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh, wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, that's not possible because but-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So the molecule would be Cl on C1, which is connected to C2 via a double bond. C2 has a methyl and a CH2CH3 group. So the substituents on C1 are Cl, and the double bond. On C2, substituents are CH(CH3) and CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 via double bond, and then to C3 and C4. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether any of the carbons in the molecule have four different substituents, making them chiral centers.

Looking at C1: it's connected to Cl, C2 (double bond), and two Hs? No, wait, because in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So C1 is bonded to Cl, C2 (double bond), and two other substituents? Wait, no. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents. So for C1, substituents are Cl and the double bond (which is a substituent?), but perhaps that's not a chiral center because it's sp2 hybridized. So C1 is sp2, so it's planar, no chiral center. C2 is also sp2. The other carbons are CH2 or CH3, which are not chiral. So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, Z configuration refers to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. So would this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think: if the molecule is symmetric, then perhaps it's not chiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because all the substituents on the double bond are not different enough.

Wait, another approach: for a molecule to be optically active, it must have at least one chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. Since this molecule has a double bond, but neither of the double-bonded carbons are chiral centers (sp2), the molecule must be symmetric. So if the substituents on either side are same, it's not chiral. For but-1-ene derivatives, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then it's not chiral. Let me think: the substituents on C1 are Cl and the other substituent (like maybe a CH2CH2CH3 or something), and on C2, perhaps a methyl and another group. Wait, but (Z) configuration refers to the arrangement. Let me think. For (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the substituents on each double bond carbon are Cl and CH2CH2CH3 on C1, and on C2, CH(CH3) and perhaps a CH2 group? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the groups on either side of the double bond are the same, then it's not chiral. For example, if both ends have Cl and some group, but in this case, one end has Cl and the other a CH(CH3). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps this compound isn't chiral because it's a double bond, but I'm not confident. Maybe I'll come back to this one.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down. The name suggests a fused ring structure. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-), attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is specified with E configuration. Now, the key is whether this molecule has a chiral center. The substituents at each stereogenic center are R and S. Wait, but wait, the molecule has a bridge or some kind of ring structure. Methanoisobenzofuran would have a benzene ring fused with a furan, but with a bridge. The substituent is at position 8, and the E configuration refers to the double bond. But, the molecule might have multiple stereocenters. Wait, the (3aR,7aS) part suggests that the 3a and 7a positions are stereocenters with R and S configurations, respectively. So if those are chiral centers, then the molecule has stereogenic centers. So this molecule would be chiral unless there's a plane of symmetry that makes it achiral. But considering the complexity of the structure, it's likely that the molecule is not symmetric. Therefore, it should exhibit optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If there are methyl groups on C2 and C3, then the structure would be HOOC-C(CH3)(something)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, the carbons are 2 and 3, so the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is four carbons in a row, with two carboxylic acid groups. So it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If 2 and 3 are each substituted with a methyl group, then they become CH(CH3) groups. So the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of these centers (C2 and C3) have the following substituents: for C2, the substituents are COOH, CH(CH3) (from C3), H, and methyl. Wait, wait: C2 is connected to COOH (from C1), two CH(CH3) groups (from C3?), and a methyl. Hmm, maybe I should draw it. C2: attached to COOH (C1), C3, and two methyl groups? No, wait, no. Wait, each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group.

Wait, no, let's think: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Replacing each CH2 with CH(CH3) would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of C2 and C3 would have the following substituents: C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3, a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, actually, each of C2 and C3 would have four substituents: for C2, the substituents are COOH (from C1), two CH(CH3) groups (no, wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (as CH(CH3)), C3 (as CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? Or wait, no: each CH2 in succinic acid is CH2, so when you add a methyl group on each CH2, you get CH(CH3) on C2 and C3.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So each CH2 group is on C2 and C3. When you have 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, that means each CH2 is substituted with a methyl group. So the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, looking at each CH(CH3) group:

For C2: substituents are COOH, CH(CH3) (C3), two CH3 groups? Wait, no. C2 is attached to COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (on C3), a methyl group, and another CH3? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list the substituents on C2:

- One substituent is the carboxylic acid group (from C1: so a single bond, so perhaps it's a -CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (which is a COOH group) and C3 (another CH(CH3)).

Wait, each CH(CH3) has four bonds. So for C2: bonds to C1 (CH(CH3)), C3 (CH(CH3)), a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, no, perhaps in the molecule, C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3, a methyl group, and another H? No, wait, because if it's CH(CH3), then it has three substituents: two CH3 and a CH2 group? Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about whether C2 and C3 are chiral centers.

If C2 has four different groups, it's chiral. Let's see: for C2, the groups are:

- The group from C1: which is a COOH group attached via a CH2 group (since the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-...). Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (which is -CH(CH3)-), but that's part of the chain. So C2's substituents are:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen (if any)
- The two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3).

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider each substituent. Let's describe it as:

C1: HOOC-CH(CH3)- 
C2: CH(CH3)- 
C3: CH(CH3)- 
C4: -COOH

So for C2, the substituents are:

- The group from C1: which is a -CH(CH3)-, but that's part of the chain.
Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the substituents as:

At C2, the substituents are:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- The adjacent C1 (which is connected to a COOH group)
- The adjacent C3 (which is also CH(CH3))
- And another substituent, which would be a hydrogen if it's CH(CH3) with three substituents. Wait, no. Wait, if the structure is CH(CH3) on C2, then it has three bonds: to C1, C3, and a methyl. Then, the fourth bond would be a hydrogen. So substituents on C2: C1 (which is a CH(CH3) connected to COOH), a methyl, a hydrogen, and C3 (CH(CH3)). So that would be four different substituents? No, because C3 is also CH(CH3), so C2 has substituents of:

- CH(CH3) (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- CH3 (methyl)
- H (hydrogen)

Wait, that's four different groups? No, because the C1 and C3 substituents are both CH(CH3) groups. So the substituents are: CH(CH3) (C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, H. So two substituents are the same (CH(CH3)), so C2 would have two identical groups. Therefore, C2 is not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has substituents: CH(CH3) (C2), another CH(CH3) (C4?), wait no, C4 is another COOH group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the configuration is R on C2 and S on C3. Now, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule. The two chiral centers are on C2 and C3. If the substituents on C2 and C3 are arranged such that there's a mirror plane between them, then the molecule could be achiral. But in this case, the substituents are both methyl groups and the same on both, but the configurations are R and S, which are mirror images. Wait, no, R and S are enantiomeric configurations. So, perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Wait, but wait, if you have two adjacent chiral centers with opposite configurations, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might be achiral. For example, meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but are achiral due to a plane of symmetry. So in this case, is the molecule a meso compound?

The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with R configuration on C2 and S on C3. Let me imagine the structure. Because the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, and the configurations are R and S, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the mirror plane could be along the middle of the molecule, making the left and right halves mirror images. If that's the case, then the molecule would be achiral (meso), so it wouldn't exhibit optical activity. But if the configurations are such that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Wait, for a meso compound, the stereocenters must be arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Let's take tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry through the center. So in this case, if the two stereocenters (C2 and C3) have opposite configurations (R and S), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and thus achiral.

So in this case, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be a meso compound, making it achiral. Therefore, it won't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. The configuration is R on C2 and S on C3. Now, if looking from the center of the molecule, the substituents on each chiral center might be arranged symmetrically. For example, on C2, the substituents could be methyl, two H's, and the adjacent COOH group, but the configurations are R and S. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Alternatively, considering that the two substituents on each chiral center are the same (both have a methyl group and are attached to similar environments), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So if the configurations are R and S, the molecule could be meso. So in this case, it's achiral.

So this compound wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**. Now, the configurations are both R on C2 and C3. Let's see if this molecule is chiral. Again, considering whether it's a meso compound. If both stereocenters are R, then perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but let's think. If both C2 and C3 are R configuration, then the arrangement around each center is the same. Without a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral. So in this case, the molecule would have two chiral centers with the same configuration, leading to no plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**. So this is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The configuration is R. Now, whether the molecule is chiral depends on whether the OH group is on a chiral center.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1. The substituents around C1 are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (assuming the ring is chair-like)
Wait, but wait, the ring is cyclohexene, so the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents on C1 would be OH, two adjacent ring carbons, and another substituent. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and possibly some substituents. So, C1 has OH, and is connected to C2 and C6 (in the ring), and the other two substituents would be hydrogens if it's a chair conformation. Alternatively, if the ring is in a certain configuration, maybe C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

Wait, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- Two ring carbons (C2 and C6)
- Another substituent, which could be a hydrogen or another group.

If the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a hydrogen, then C1 would have four different groups: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and H. Wait, but if the ring is symmetric, perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are the same, making C1 not a chiral center. Alternatively, if the ring is asymmetric, C1 could be chiral.

Wait, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the ring has a double bond, which affects the substituents. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so the ring is not fully saturated. But for the configuration at C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- The ring (with a double bond), which would have two different substituents on either side of the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of chair conformations. If the cyclohexene ring is in a chair conformation with the double bond in a certain position, C1 could have four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps C1 is not a chiral center because the substituents are not all different.

Alternatively, for a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (but if the ring is symmetric, these would be identical)
- A hydrogen

If the two CH2 groups are identical, then C1 has three substituents: OH, identical CH2 groups, and H. Thus, no chiral center. But wait, the double bond might break the symmetry. Let me think. In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituents on C3 and C4 are each connected to two CH2 groups on either side. So perhaps the substituents on C1 are all different, making it a chiral center. Wait, but if the substituents from the ring are identical, then C1 wouldn't be chiral. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the OH group is on C1 and the ring is symmetric with respect to a plane passing through C1 and the double bond, then the molecule could be achiral. But if the substituents around C1 are all different, then it's chiral.

Wait, but the configuration is given as R. So it must be a chiral center. Because if it's R configuration, then the molecule must have a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**. So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration. Now, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Let me imagine the positions: 1,3,5 are every other carbon. So the substituents are on alternate positions. Would this arrangement lead to a plane of symmetry?

If the three hydroxyl groups are on C1, C3, and C5, and all are in the same configuration (s), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if looking down the center of the ring, the substituents on opposite sides could mirror each other. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric because the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait, in a cyclohexane ring, substituents at 1,3,5 positions would be in a symmetrical arrangement. Let me think in terms of chair conformations. If the ring is in a chair, and the OH groups are axial or equatorial, perhaps the arrangement leads to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a threefold axis of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, in the case where all three OH groups are in the same configuration, the molecule might be symmetric. So, for example, if C1, C3, and C5 each have an OH group in the same configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, another approach: the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents mirror each other on either side. For example, if the substituents on C1, C3, and C5 are arranged such that each has a mirror image on the opposite side of the ring, the molecule would be achiral. But in this case, with all three OH groups in the same configuration (s), perhaps the arrangement is such that each OH has a mirror image. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents aren't symmetrically arranged.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think. For a cyclohexane with three substituents on 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration, the molecule is likely to be symmetric. Because rotating the ring 120 degrees would bring each substituent into the others' place. So perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but if all three substituents are the same and on every other carbon, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So perhaps this molecule is achiral, thus not optically active.

Wait, but another thought: if the substituents are on 1,3,5 positions and are all in the same configuration, their arrangement could lead to a non-superimposable mirror image, making the molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents are in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. But wait, meso compounds usually have multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. In this case, perhaps the molecule is a meso form, making it achiral. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral. For example, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all OH groups in the same configuration might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: if a molecule has an even number of stereocenters, it could be a meso compound. But in this case, there are three stereocenters, which is odd, so it can't be a meso compound. Therefore, the molecule must be chiral, making it optically active.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule has three stereocenters, all s configuration. So each of C1, C3, and C5 is a stereocenter. Now, to determine if the molecule is chiral, I have to see if there's a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the mirror image non-superimposable, then it's chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral.

In a cyclohexane ring with substituents on 1,3,5, the arrangement could be such that each substituent has a mirror image across a plane. For example, if the substituents on C1, C3, and C5 are all oriented in the same way, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps they are arranged in a way that no plane of symmetry exists. 

Wait, perhaps if the OH groups are all axial, then the molecule would have a center of symmetry (since each axial substituent would have a mirror image in the opposite direction). But if they are equatorial, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetric. For example, the arrangement of the OH groups could lead to no plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

I'm a bit uncertain here, but I'll go with the idea that the molecule is chiral because the three stereocenters don't allow for a plane of symmetry. So this compound would exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**. So the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone. The structure would be (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCO-. No, wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO-. No, butan-1-one is CH2=CHCH2CO? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO; that can't be right. Let me think: butanone can be either 2-butanone or butan-1-one. But butan-1-one is (CH3)CH2CH2CO, but wait, the structure would be:

O
||
C-R, where R is (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is the carbonyl group. So the molecule is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3). Wait, but it's butan-1-one, which has four carbons in total. So the carbonyl is on the first carbon, followed by three more. So the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, butan-1-one has four carbons with the carbonyl on C1. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a cyclopentyl group on C1. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituents would be cyclopentyl on C1, methyl on C3, and the rest are CH2 groups.

Now, the question is whether any of the carbons in this structure are chiral centers.

Looking at each carbon:

C1: carbonyl group, double-bonded to O. So it's sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.

C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), two CH2 groups, and perhaps a methyl. Wait, no. Let's look at the structure:

O=C(C5H9)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? That can't be right, because that would be pentan-1-one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO. No, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. No, wait, butanone is 2-butanone, which is (CH3)2CO. But butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, but that's not possible because the carbonyl needs to be between two carbons. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would be pentan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, making it a five-carbon chain? Or perhaps it's O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-... Wait, perhaps the actual structure isn't crucial here. The key is whether any carbon is a chiral center.

Looking at the molecule, the only possible chiral center would be C3, which has a methyl group. Let's see: C3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH2-)
- C4 (CH2-)
- A methyl group
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, in the structure, C3 is CH(CH3). So substituents are:

- C2 (CH2-)
- C4 (CH2-)
- Methyl
- And a hydrogen. Wait, if it's CH(CH3), then it has four substituents: two CH2 groups, a methyl, and a hydrogen. Are all four substituents different? Let's see: CH2- (from C2), CH2- (from C4), CH3, and H. Are the two CH2 groups identical? Yes, because they're both connected to C3. So substituents are:

- Two identical CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)
- CH3
- H

Since two substituents are the same, C3 is not a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't optically active.

Now, let me compile the results for each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: I'm still unsure, but earlier I thought it's not chiral because double bonds don't contribute to chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so not chiral. So no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: has stereocenters, so yes, chiral. Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso compound, so achiral. No optical activity.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: not meso, so chiral. Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: has a chiral center (R configuration), so yes. Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters, no plane of symmetry, so chiral. Optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: no chiral centers. No optical activity.

So counting the optically active compounds:

Compound 2: yes
Compound 4: yes
Compound 5: yes
Compound 6: yes

Wait, that's four. But wait, earlier I thought compound 6 might be achiral, but I decided it was chiral. Let me recount.

Wait, I thought 2,4,5,6 are active. So that's four.

But let me double-check each:

1. (Z) compound: not chiral. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. Yes.

7. No.

So that's four compounds with optical activity.

Wait, but the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the answer would be D)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or an element of asymmetry, and it is not achiral due to symmetry or other factors.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Neither C1 nor C2 is a chiral center because they are sp² hybridized. Additionally, the molecule lacks any other chiral centers. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This complex molecule contains stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) configurations, respectively. The molecule lacks symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the molecule is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry that makes the two chiral centers mirror images of each other. As a result, the molecule is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. Unlike the meso compound in (3), there is no plane of symmetry, so the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is attached to four different substituents: a hydrogen atom, the cyclohexene ring, and two other groups. This makes C1 a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the (s) configuration. While the molecule has three stereocenters, it lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl group at C1 is sp² hybridized and not a chiral center. The other carbons in the molecule are either sp³ hybridized but lack four different substituents (e.g., C3 has two identical CH₂ groups). Therefore, the molecule is **not optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(2), (4), (5), and (6)**. This gives a total of **4 optically active compounds**.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity relates to whether a compound has chiral centers, meaning they're not superimposable on their mirror images. But wait, there are some exceptions too, like if the compound has a plane of symmetry or if the chiral centers are in a way that they cancel each other out. 

Let me look at each compound one by one. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many are optically active. 

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**. Wait, so the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, wait, no. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon are Cl on C1, and on C2, there's a methyl group and the other substituents. Wait, but for a double bond, each carbon can have two substituents. So for C1, it's Cl and CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Let me count the substituents: C1 has Cl and the double bond. So on C1, the substituents are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (since but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2). Wait, maybe it's (Z) configuration, but the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, but C1 has Cl, a double bond, and two other substituents? No, wait, in an alkene, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2CH3 group. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, no, butene is four carbons. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl and the double bond (which counts as a substituent?), and on C2, a methyl and another CH2CH3. Wait, but for a double bond, each carbon is attached to two other carbons. So for C1, it's Cl and the double bond. Wait, but in this case, the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh, wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, that's not possible because but-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So the molecule would be Cl on C1, which is connected to C2 via a double bond. C2 has a methyl and a CH2CH3 group. So the substituents on C1 are Cl, and the double bond. On C2, substituents are CH(CH3) and CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 via double bond, and then to C3 and C4. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether any of the carbons in the molecule have four different substituents, making them chiral centers.

Looking at C1: it's connected to Cl, C2 (double bond), and two Hs? No, wait, because in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So C1 is bonded to Cl, C2 (double bond), and two other substituents? Wait, no. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents. So for C1, substituents are Cl and the double bond (which is a substituent?), but perhaps that's not a chiral center because it's sp2 hybridized. So C1 is sp2, so it's planar, no chiral center. C2 is also sp2. The other carbons are CH2 or CH3, which are not chiral. So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, Z configuration refers to the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. So would this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think: if the molecule is symmetric, then perhaps it's not chiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because all the substituents on the double bond are not different enough.

Wait, another approach: for a molecule to be optically active, it must have at least one chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. Since this molecule has a double bond, but neither of the double-bonded carbons are chiral centers (sp2), the molecule must be symmetric. So if the substituents on either side are same, it's not chiral. For but-1-ene derivatives, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then it's not chiral. Let me think: the substituents on C1 are Cl and the other substituent (like maybe a CH2CH2CH3 or something), and on C2, perhaps a methyl and another group. Wait, but (Z) configuration refers to the arrangement. Let me think. For (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the substituents on each double bond carbon are Cl and CH2CH2CH3 on C1, and on C2, CH(CH3) and perhaps a CH2 group? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the groups on either side of the double bond are the same, then it's not chiral. For example, if both ends have Cl and some group, but in this case, one end has Cl and the other a CH(CH3). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps this compound isn't chiral because it's a double bond, but I'm not confident. Maybe I'll come back to this one.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down. The name suggests a fused ring structure. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-), attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is specified with E configuration. Now, the key is whether this molecule has a chiral center. The substituents at each stereogenic center are R and S. Wait, but wait, the molecule has a bridge or some kind of ring structure. Methanoisobenzofuran would have a benzene ring fused with a furan, but with a bridge. The substituent is at position 8, and the E configuration refers to the double bond. But, the molecule might have multiple stereocenters. Wait, the (3aR,7aS) part suggests that the 3a and 7a positions are stereocenters with R and S configurations, respectively. So if those are chiral centers, then the molecule has stereogenic centers. So this molecule would be chiral unless there's a plane of symmetry that makes it achiral. But considering the complexity of the structure, it's likely that the molecule is not symmetric. Therefore, it should exhibit optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If there are methyl groups on C2 and C3, then the structure would be HOOC-C(CH3)(something)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, the carbons are 2 and 3, so the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is four carbons in a row, with two carboxylic acid groups. So it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If 2 and 3 are each substituted with a methyl group, then they become CH(CH3) groups. So the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of these centers (C2 and C3) have the following substituents: for C2, the substituents are COOH, CH(CH3) (from C3), H, and methyl. Wait, wait: C2 is connected to COOH (from C1), two CH(CH3) groups (from C3?), and a methyl. Hmm, maybe I should draw it. C2: attached to COOH (C1), C3, and two methyl groups? No, wait, no. Wait, each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group.

Wait, no, let's think: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Replacing each CH2 with CH(CH3) would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of C2 and C3 would have the following substituents: C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3, a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, actually, each of C2 and C3 would have four substituents: for C2, the substituents are COOH (from C1), two CH(CH3) groups (no, wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (as CH(CH3)), C3 (as CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? Or wait, no: each CH2 in succinic acid is CH2, so when you add a methyl group on each CH2, you get CH(CH3) on C2 and C3.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So each CH2 group is on C2 and C3. When you have 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, that means each CH2 is substituted with a methyl group. So the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, looking at each CH(CH3) group:

For C2: substituents are COOH, CH(CH3) (C3), two CH3 groups? Wait, no. C2 is attached to COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (on C3), a methyl group, and another CH3? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list the substituents on C2:

- One substituent is the carboxylic acid group (from C1: so a single bond, so perhaps it's a -CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (which is a COOH group) and C3 (another CH(CH3)).

Wait, each CH(CH3) has four bonds. So for C2: bonds to C1 (CH(CH3)), C3 (CH(CH3)), a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, no, perhaps in the molecule, C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3, a methyl group, and another H? No, wait, because if it's CH(CH3), then it has three substituents: two CH3 and a CH2 group? Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about whether C2 and C3 are chiral centers.

If C2 has four different groups, it's chiral. Let's see: for C2, the groups are:

- The group from C1: which is a COOH group attached via a CH2 group (since the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-...). Wait, no. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (which is -CH(CH3)-), but that's part of the chain. So C2's substituents are:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen (if any)
- The two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3).

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider each substituent. Let's describe it as:

C1: HOOC-CH(CH3)- 
C2: CH(CH3)- 
C3: CH(CH3)- 
C4: -COOH

So for C2, the substituents are:

- The group from C1: which is a -CH(CH3)-, but that's part of the chain.
Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the substituents as:

At C2, the substituents are:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- The adjacent C1 (which is connected to a COOH group)
- The adjacent C3 (which is also CH(CH3))
- And another substituent, which would be a hydrogen if it's CH(CH3) with three substituents. Wait, no. Wait, if the structure is CH(CH3) on C2, then it has three bonds: to C1, C3, and a methyl. Then, the fourth bond would be a hydrogen. So substituents on C2: C1 (which is a CH(CH3) connected to COOH), a methyl, a hydrogen, and C3 (CH(CH3)). So that would be four different substituents? No, because C3 is also CH(CH3), so C2 has substituents of:

- CH(CH3) (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- CH3 (methyl)
- H (hydrogen)

Wait, that's four different groups? No, because the C1 and C3 substituents are both CH(CH3) groups. So the substituents are: CH(CH3) (C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, H. So two substituents are the same (CH(CH3)), so C2 would have two identical groups. Therefore, C2 is not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has substituents: CH(CH3) (C2), another CH(CH3) (C4?), wait no, C4 is another COOH group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the configuration is R on C2 and S on C3. Now, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule. The two chiral centers are on C2 and C3. If the substituents on C2 and C3 are arranged such that there's a mirror plane between them, then the molecule could be achiral. But in this case, the substituents are both methyl groups and the same on both, but the configurations are R and S, which are mirror images. Wait, no, R and S are enantiomeric configurations. So, perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Wait, but wait, if you have two adjacent chiral centers with opposite configurations, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might be achiral. For example, meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but are achiral due to a plane of symmetry. So in this case, is the molecule a meso compound?

The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with R configuration on C2 and S on C3. Let me imagine the structure. Because the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, and the configurations are R and S, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the mirror plane could be along the middle of the molecule, making the left and right halves mirror images. If that's the case, then the molecule would be achiral (meso), so it wouldn't exhibit optical activity. But if the configurations are such that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Wait, for a meso compound, the stereocenters must be arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Let's take tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry through the center. So in this case, if the two stereocenters (C2 and C3) have opposite configurations (R and S), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and thus achiral.

So in this case, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be a meso compound, making it achiral. Therefore, it won't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule is succinic acid with methyl groups on C2 and C3. The configuration is R on C2 and S on C3. Now, if looking from the center of the molecule, the substituents on each chiral center might be arranged symmetrically. For example, on C2, the substituents could be methyl, two H's, and the adjacent COOH group, but the configurations are R and S. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Alternatively, considering that the two substituents on each chiral center are the same (both have a methyl group and are attached to similar environments), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So if the configurations are R and S, the molecule could be meso. So in this case, it's achiral.

So this compound wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**. Now, the configurations are both R on C2 and C3. Let's see if this molecule is chiral. Again, considering whether it's a meso compound. If both stereocenters are R, then perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but let's think. If both C2 and C3 are R configuration, then the arrangement around each center is the same. Without a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral. So in this case, the molecule would have two chiral centers with the same configuration, leading to no plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**. So this is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The configuration is R. Now, whether the molecule is chiral depends on whether the OH group is on a chiral center.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1. The substituents around C1 are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (assuming the ring is chair-like)
Wait, but wait, the ring is cyclohexene, so the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents on C1 would be OH, two adjacent ring carbons, and another substituent. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and possibly some substituents. So, C1 has OH, and is connected to C2 and C6 (in the ring), and the other two substituents would be hydrogens if it's a chair conformation. Alternatively, if the ring is in a certain configuration, maybe C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

Wait, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- Two ring carbons (C2 and C6)
- Another substituent, which could be a hydrogen or another group.

If the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a hydrogen, then C1 would have four different groups: OH, CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), and H. Wait, but if the ring is symmetric, perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are the same, making C1 not a chiral center. Alternatively, if the ring is asymmetric, C1 could be chiral.

Wait, but in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the ring has a double bond, which affects the substituents. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so the ring is not fully saturated. But for the configuration at C1, the substituents would be:

- OH
- The ring (with a double bond), which would have two different substituents on either side of the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of chair conformations. If the cyclohexene ring is in a chair conformation with the double bond in a certain position, C1 could have four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps C1 is not a chiral center because the substituents are not all different.

Alternatively, for a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (but if the ring is symmetric, these would be identical)
- A hydrogen

If the two CH2 groups are identical, then C1 has three substituents: OH, identical CH2 groups, and H. Thus, no chiral center. But wait, the double bond might break the symmetry. Let me think. In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituents on C3 and C4 are each connected to two CH2 groups on either side. So perhaps the substituents on C1 are all different, making it a chiral center. Wait, but if the substituents from the ring are identical, then C1 wouldn't be chiral. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the OH group is on C1 and the ring is symmetric with respect to a plane passing through C1 and the double bond, then the molecule could be achiral. But if the substituents around C1 are all different, then it's chiral.

Wait, but the configuration is given as R. So it must be a chiral center. Because if it's R configuration, then the molecule must have a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**. So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration. Now, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Let me imagine the positions: 1,3,5 are every other carbon. So the substituents are on alternate positions. Would this arrangement lead to a plane of symmetry?

If the three hydroxyl groups are on C1, C3, and C5, and all are in the same configuration (s), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if looking down the center of the ring, the substituents on opposite sides could mirror each other. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric because the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but wait, in a cyclohexane ring, substituents at 1,3,5 positions would be in a symmetrical arrangement. Let me think in terms of chair conformations. If the ring is in a chair, and the OH groups are axial or equatorial, perhaps the arrangement leads to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a threefold axis of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, in the case where all three OH groups are in the same configuration, the molecule might be symmetric. So, for example, if C1, C3, and C5 each have an OH group in the same configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, another approach: the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents mirror each other on either side. For example, if the substituents on C1, C3, and C5 are arranged such that each has a mirror image on the opposite side of the ring, the molecule would be achiral. But in this case, with all three OH groups in the same configuration (s), perhaps the arrangement is such that each OH has a mirror image. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents aren't symmetrically arranged.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think. For a cyclohexane with three substituents on 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration, the molecule is likely to be symmetric. Because rotating the ring 120 degrees would bring each substituent into the others' place. So perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but if all three substituents are the same and on every other carbon, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So perhaps this molecule is achiral, thus not optically active.

Wait, but another thought: if the substituents are on 1,3,5 positions and are all in the same configuration, their arrangement could lead to a non-superimposable mirror image, making the molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents are in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. But wait, meso compounds usually have multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. In this case, perhaps the molecule is a meso form, making it achiral. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral. For example, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all OH groups in the same configuration might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: if a molecule has an even number of stereocenters, it could be a meso compound. But in this case, there are three stereocenters, which is odd, so it can't be a meso compound. Therefore, the molecule must be chiral, making it optically active.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The molecule has three stereocenters, all s configuration. So each of C1, C3, and C5 is a stereocenter. Now, to determine if the molecule is chiral, I have to see if there's a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the mirror image non-superimposable, then it's chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral.

In a cyclohexane ring with substituents on 1,3,5, the arrangement could be such that each substituent has a mirror image across a plane. For example, if the substituents on C1, C3, and C5 are all oriented in the same way, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps they are arranged in a way that no plane of symmetry exists. 

Wait, perhaps if the OH groups are all axial, then the molecule would have a center of symmetry (since each axial substituent would have a mirror image in the opposite direction). But if they are equatorial, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetric. For example, the arrangement of the OH groups could lead to no plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

I'm a bit uncertain here, but I'll go with the idea that the molecule is chiral because the three stereocenters don't allow for a plane of symmetry. So this compound would exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**. So the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone. The structure would be (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCO-. No, wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO-. No, butan-1-one is CH2=CHCH2CO? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO; that can't be right. Let me think: butanone can be either 2-butanone or butan-1-one. But butan-1-one is (CH3)CH2CH2CO, but wait, the structure would be:

O
||
C-R, where R is (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is the carbonyl group. So the molecule is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3). Wait, but it's butan-1-one, which has four carbons in total. So the carbonyl is on the first carbon, followed by three more. So the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, butan-1-one has four carbons with the carbonyl on C1. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a cyclopentyl group on C1. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituents would be cyclopentyl on C1, methyl on C3, and the rest are CH2 groups.

Now, the question is whether any of the carbons in this structure are chiral centers.

Looking at each carbon:

C1: carbonyl group, double-bonded to O. So it's sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.

C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), two CH2 groups, and perhaps a methyl. Wait, no. Let's look at the structure:

O=C(C5H9)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? That can't be right, because that would be pentan-1-one. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO. No, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. No, wait, butanone is 2-butanone, which is (CH3)2CO. But butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, but that's not possible because the carbonyl needs to be between two carbons. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would be pentan-1-one. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, making it a five-carbon chain? Or perhaps it's O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-... Wait, perhaps the actual structure isn't crucial here. The key is whether any carbon is a chiral center.

Looking at the molecule, the only possible chiral center would be C3, which has a methyl group. Let's see: C3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH2-)
- C4 (CH2-)
- A methyl group
- And perhaps another substituent.

Wait, in the structure, C3 is CH(CH3). So substituents are:

- C2 (CH2-)
- C4 (CH2-)
- Methyl
- And a hydrogen. Wait, if it's CH(CH3), then it has four substituents: two CH2 groups, a methyl, and a hydrogen. Are all four substituents different? Let's see: CH2- (from C2), CH2- (from C4), CH3, and H. Are the two CH2 groups identical? Yes, because they're both connected to C3. So substituents are:

- Two identical CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)
- CH3
- H

Since two substituents are the same, C3 is not a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't optically active.

Now, let me compile the results for each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: I'm still unsure, but earlier I thought it's not chiral because double bonds don't contribute to chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so not chiral. So no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: has stereocenters, so yes, chiral. Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso compound, so achiral. No optical activity.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: not meso, so chiral. Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: has a chiral center (R configuration), so yes. Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three stereocenters, no plane of symmetry, so chiral. Optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: no chiral centers. No optical activity.

So counting the optically active compounds:

Compound 2: yes
Compound 4: yes
Compound 5: yes
Compound 6: yes

Wait, that's four. But wait, earlier I thought compound 6 might be achiral, but I decided it was chiral. Let me recount.

Wait, I thought 2,4,5,6 are active. So that's four.

But let me double-check each:

1. (Z) compound: not chiral. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. Yes.

7. No.

So that's four compounds with optical activity.

Wait, but the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the answer would be D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or an element of asymmetry, and it is not achiral due to symmetry or other factors.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Neither C1 nor C2 is a chiral center because they are sp² hybridized. Additionally, the molecule lacks any other chiral centers. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This complex molecule contains stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (R) and (S) configurations, respectively. The molecule lacks symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, the molecule is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry that makes the two chiral centers mirror images of each other. As a result, the molecule is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. Unlike the meso compound in (3), there is no plane of symmetry, so the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is attached to four different substituents: a hydrogen atom, the cyclohexene ring, and two other groups. This makes C1 a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the (s) configuration. While the molecule has three stereocenters, it lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl group at C1 is sp² hybridized and not a chiral center. The other carbons in the molecule are either sp³ hybridized but lack four different substituents (e.g., C3 has two identical CH₂ groups). Therefore, the molecule is **not optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(2), (4), (5), and (6)**. This gives a total of **4 optically active compounds**.
