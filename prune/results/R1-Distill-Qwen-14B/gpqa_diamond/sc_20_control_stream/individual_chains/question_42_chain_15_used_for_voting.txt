Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not exactly sure how that affects this problem, maybe it's just about their orbital periods and stuff.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, and Planet2's is 2.3 times Planet3's. That probably means Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, which in turn is hotter than Planet3.

Mass ratios are also given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is a bit more massive than Planet3. So, Planet3 is the least massive of the three.

The question is about finding the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

All three have the same albedo, which is 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because it determines how much light is reflected. But since all are same, maybe that's a constant factor and cancels out in the equations.

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula is something like T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4). But wait, that's the formula for equilibrium temperature, right? So, T is proportional to sqrt(L) / D^(1/2) if a is the same. Because sqrt(L) would be from L^(1/4) times D^(-1/2), let me think again.

Wait, let me write the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by:

T = [( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D² )]^(1/4 )

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity.
- a is the planet's albedo.
- D is the distance from the star.
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since the albedo (a) is the same for all three planets, and assuming the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all (they're orbiting the same star?), the ratio of their temperatures depends on the inverse square root of their distances.

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Wait, because if you rearrange the formula, D = sqrt( L (1-a) / (16 π σ T^4) )^0.5, but perhaps it's easier to consider the ratio.

Let me think in terms of ratios. Let's define each planet's equilibrium temperature as T_i, and their distances as D_i.

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Similarly, T2 / T3 = sqrt( D3 / D2 )

But the problem gives me T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3.

So, let's write that out:

1.4 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

=> (1.4)^2 = D2/D1 → 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3 → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → (2.3)^2 = D3/D2 → 5.29 = D3/D2 → D3 = 5.29 * D2.

So, substituting D2 from the first equation, D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1 ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 is what?

Let me calculate that. 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is around 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the problem is about the orbital periods. The orbital period is determined by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star) divided by the mass of the star. But wait, when dealing with exoplanets, if the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, which it is, then the formula simplifies. So, Kepler's law in this context is:

P² ∝ D³ / (M_star)

Wait, but wait, actually, the formula is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) ) * D³. But since M >> m, it's approximately P² = (4π²/(G M)) * D³. So P² is proportional to D³ / M. But in this problem, the star's mass is the same for all three planets, right? Because they're part of the same system. So M is same for all, so P² is proportional to D^3.

So, the ratio of the periods squared is the cube of the ratio of the distances.

We want to find P3 / P1.

Since P² ∝ D³, so (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3.

We already found that D3/D1 ≈ 10.37.

So, (P3/P1)^2 = (10.37)^3.

Let me compute 10.37 cubed. 10^3 is 1000; 0.37^3 is about 0.0506. But wait, 10.37 is 10 + 0.37.

10.37^3 = (10 + 0.37)^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.37 + 3*(10)*(0.37)^2 + (0.37)^3.

Calculating each term:
10^3 = 1000
3 * 100 * 0.37 = 3 * 37 = 111 → 111
3 * 10 * (0.1369) = 3 * 1.369 = 4.107
0.37^3 ≈ 0.050653 → 0.050653.

Adding them all together: 1000 + 111 = 1111; 1111 +4.107 = 1115.107; +0.050653 → ≈ 1115.1576.

So, (P3/P1)^2 ≈ 1115.1576 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1115.1576).

What's the sqrt of 1115?

Hmm, 33^2 is 1089. 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.4^2: 33^2=1089, 0.4^2=0.16, 2*33*0.4=26.4. So 1089 +26.4 +0.16 = 1115.56. Oh, that's very close to 1115.16.

Wait, 33.4^2 is 33.4 * 33.4 = ?

Let me compute it step by step:

33 * 33 = 1089.
33 * 0.4 = 13.2
0.4 * 33 = 13.2
0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16
So (33 + 0.4)^2 = 33^2 + 2 *33 *0.4 +0.4^2 = 1089 + 26.4 + 0.16 = 1115.56.

Oh, so 33.4^2 is 1115.56, which is just a bit higher than 1115.16.

The actual value of (P3/P1)^2 is 1115.1576. So sqrt(1115.1576) is a little less than 33.4.

Wait, because 33.4^2 is 1115.56, which is 0.4 higher than our target of 1115.1576.

So let's find the difference: 1115.56 - 1115.1576 = 0.4024.

So, 33.4^2 = 1115.56 → our value is 1115.1576, which is about 0.4024 less than that of 33.4.

We can approximate how much less than 33.4 is needed. Let me think of x as the difference. So, (33.4 - x)^2 = 1115.1576.

Expanding that, 33.4² - 2*33.4*x +x² = 1115.1576.

We know 33.4^2 is 1115.56. So,

1115.56 - 66.8 x + x² = 1115.1576.

Ignoring x² for small x, we get:

-66.8 x ≈ 1115.1576 - 1115.56 → -0.4024.

So,

x ≈ (0.4024) / 66.8 → approximately 0.006.

So, 33.4 - 0.006 = 33.394. So, approximately 33.394. So, P3/P1 ≈ 33.4, but a little less. But looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

Wait, so option D is about 33.4. But wait, our calculation suggests that P3 is about 33.4 times larger than P1. So the ratio is ~33.4, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check. Because maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me retrace. The equilibrium temperature ratios were given as T1/T2=1.4 and T2/T3=2.3. So T1 is hotter than T2, which is hotter than T3.

We used the equilibrium temperature formula to find the distances. So T1 = [L(1-a)/(16 pi sigma D1^2)]^0.25.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( (D2)/(D1) )

Which gave D2 = (T1/T2)^2 * D1 = (1.96) D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3 = (T2/T3)^2 * D2 = (5.29) * D2 =5.29 * 1.96 D1.

5.29 *1.96 is about 10.3684. So D3=10.37 D1.

Kepler's law: P² ∝ D³ → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Wait, wait a second. I think I messed up something here. Because if P² is proportional to D^3, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2), not (D3/D1)^3 under a square root.

Wait, no. No, because ratio-wise, (P3/P1)^2 = (D3^3 / D1^3) → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

Which is the same as sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ).

So D3/D1 is 10.37. So cube is 10.37^3 ≈1115.1576. Then sqrt(1115.1576) is about 33.4.

So P3/P1 is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

But wait, the options are A ~10.4, which is the distance ratio, not the period. So the period is much larger.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Ratios
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is given by:

\[
T = \left[ \frac{L (1 - a)}{16 \pi \sigma D^2} \right]^{1/4}
\]

where \( L \) is the star's luminosity, \( a \) is the albedo, \( D \) is the distance from the star, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the albedo \( a \) and the star's luminosity \( L \) are constant for all three planets, the ratio of their temperatures depends on the inverse square root of their distances:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}}
\]

From the problem, we are given:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3
\]

Using the first ratio:
\[
1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \implies \left(1.4\right)^2 = \frac{D_2}{D_1} \implies D_2 = 1.96 \, D_1
\]

Using the second ratio:
\[
2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \implies \left(2.3\right)^2 = \frac{D_3}{D_2} \implies D_3 = 5.29 \, D_2
\]

Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 \, D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 \, D_2 \):
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, D_1 \approx 10.37 \, D_1
\]

Thus, the distance of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.37 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio
Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star):

\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]

Taking the ratio of the periods:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 = 10.37 \):
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(10.37\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( 10.37^3 \):
\[
10.37^3 = 10^3 + 3 \cdot 10^2 \cdot 0.37 + 3 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.37^2 + 0.37^3
\]
\[
10.37^3 \approx 1000 + 111 + 4.107 + 0.050653 \approx 1115.1576
\]

Thus:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 \approx 1115.1576
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1115.1576} \approx 33.4
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( 33.4 \) times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result with the options provided:

- **A)** ~10.4 (incorrect, corresponds to the distance ratio, not the period ratio)
- **B)** ~3.2 (incorrect)
- **C)** ~4.4 (incorrect)
- **D)** ~33.4 (correct)

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not exactly sure how that affects this problem, maybe it's just about their orbital periods and stuff.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, and Planet2's is 2.3 times Planet3's. That probably means Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, which in turn is hotter than Planet3.

Mass ratios are also given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is a bit more massive than Planet3. So, Planet3 is the least massive of the three.

The question is about finding the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

All three have the same albedo, which is 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because it determines how much light is reflected. But since all are same, maybe that's a constant factor and cancels out in the equations.

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula is something like T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4). But wait, that's the formula for equilibrium temperature, right? So, T is proportional to sqrt(L) / D^(1/2) if a is the same. Because sqrt(L) would be from L^(1/4) times D^(-1/2), let me think again.

Wait, let me write the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by:

T = [( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D² )]^(1/4 )

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity.
- a is the planet's albedo.
- D is the distance from the star.
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since the albedo (a) is the same for all three planets, and assuming the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all (they're orbiting the same star?), the ratio of their temperatures depends on the inverse square root of their distances.

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Wait, because if you rearrange the formula, D = sqrt( L (1-a) / (16 π σ T^4) )^0.5, but perhaps it's easier to consider the ratio.

Let me think in terms of ratios. Let's define each planet's equilibrium temperature as T_i, and their distances as D_i.

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Similarly, T2 / T3 = sqrt( D3 / D2 )

But the problem gives me T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3.

So, let's write that out:

1.4 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

=> (1.4)^2 = D2/D1 → 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3 → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → (2.3)^2 = D3/D2 → 5.29 = D3/D2 → D3 = 5.29 * D2.

So, substituting D2 from the first equation, D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1 ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 is what?

Let me calculate that. 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is around 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the problem is about the orbital periods. The orbital period is determined by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star) divided by the mass of the star. But wait, when dealing with exoplanets, if the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, which it is, then the formula simplifies. So, Kepler's law in this context is:

P² ∝ D³ / (M_star)

Wait, but wait, actually, the formula is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) ) * D³. But since M >> m, it's approximately P² = (4π²/(G M)) * D³. So P² is proportional to D³ / M. But in this problem, the star's mass is the same for all three planets, right? Because they're part of the same system. So M is same for all, so P² is proportional to D^3.

So, the ratio of the periods squared is the cube of the ratio of the distances.

We want to find P3 / P1.

Since P² ∝ D³, so (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3.

We already found that D3/D1 ≈ 10.37.

So, (P3/P1)^2 = (10.37)^3.

Let me compute 10.37 cubed. 10^3 is 1000; 0.37^3 is about 0.0506. But wait, 10.37 is 10 + 0.37.

10.37^3 = (10 + 0.37)^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.37 + 3*(10)*(0.37)^2 + (0.37)^3.

Calculating each term:
10^3 = 1000
3 * 100 * 0.37 = 3 * 37 = 111 → 111
3 * 10 * (0.1369) = 3 * 1.369 = 4.107
0.37^3 ≈ 0.050653 → 0.050653.

Adding them all together: 1000 + 111 = 1111; 1111 +4.107 = 1115.107; +0.050653 → ≈ 1115.1576.

So, (P3/P1)^2 ≈ 1115.1576 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1115.1576).

What's the sqrt of 1115?

Hmm, 33^2 is 1089. 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34.

Compute 33.4^2: 33^2=1089, 0.4^2=0.16, 2*33*0.4=26.4. So 1089 +26.4 +0.16 = 1115.56. Oh, that's very close to 1115.16.

Wait, 33.4^2 is 33.4 * 33.4 = ?

Let me compute it step by step:

33 * 33 = 1089.
33 * 0.4 = 13.2
0.4 * 33 = 13.2
0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16
So (33 + 0.4)^2 = 33^2 + 2 *33 *0.4 +0.4^2 = 1089 + 26.4 + 0.16 = 1115.56.

Oh, so 33.4^2 is 1115.56, which is just a bit higher than 1115.16.

The actual value of (P3/P1)^2 is 1115.1576. So sqrt(1115.1576) is a little less than 33.4.

Wait, because 33.4^2 is 1115.56, which is 0.4 higher than our target of 1115.1576.

So let's find the difference: 1115.56 - 1115.1576 = 0.4024.

So, 33.4^2 = 1115.56 → our value is 1115.1576, which is about 0.4024 less than that of 33.4.

We can approximate how much less than 33.4 is needed. Let me think of x as the difference. So, (33.4 - x)^2 = 1115.1576.

Expanding that, 33.4² - 2*33.4*x +x² = 1115.1576.

We know 33.4^2 is 1115.56. So,

1115.56 - 66.8 x + x² = 1115.1576.

Ignoring x² for small x, we get:

-66.8 x ≈ 1115.1576 - 1115.56 → -0.4024.

So,

x ≈ (0.4024) / 66.8 → approximately 0.006.

So, 33.4 - 0.006 = 33.394. So, approximately 33.394. So, P3/P1 ≈ 33.4, but a little less. But looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

Wait, so option D is about 33.4. But wait, our calculation suggests that P3 is about 33.4 times larger than P1. So the ratio is ~33.4, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check. Because maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me retrace. The equilibrium temperature ratios were given as T1/T2=1.4 and T2/T3=2.3. So T1 is hotter than T2, which is hotter than T3.

We used the equilibrium temperature formula to find the distances. So T1 = [L(1-a)/(16 pi sigma D1^2)]^0.25.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( (D2)/(D1) )

Which gave D2 = (T1/T2)^2 * D1 = (1.96) D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3 = (T2/T3)^2 * D2 = (5.29) * D2 =5.29 * 1.96 D1.

5.29 *1.96 is about 10.3684. So D3=10.37 D1.

Kepler's law: P² ∝ D³ → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Wait, wait a second. I think I messed up something here. Because if P² is proportional to D^3, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2), not (D3/D1)^3 under a square root.

Wait, no. No, because ratio-wise, (P3/P1)^2 = (D3^3 / D1^3) → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

Which is the same as sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ).

So D3/D1 is 10.37. So cube is 10.37^3 ≈1115.1576. Then sqrt(1115.1576) is about 33.4.

So P3/P1 is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

But wait, the options are A ~10.4, which is the distance ratio, not the period. So the period is much larger.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Ratios
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is given by:

\[
T = \left[ \frac{L (1 - a)}{16 \pi \sigma D^2} \right]^{1/4}
\]

where \( L \) is the star's luminosity, \( a \) is the albedo, \( D \) is the distance from the star, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the albedo \( a \) and the star's luminosity \( L \) are constant for all three planets, the ratio of their temperatures depends on the inverse square root of their distances:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}}
\]

From the problem, we are given:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3
\]

Using the first ratio:
\[
1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \implies \left(1.4\right)^2 = \frac{D_2}{D_1} \implies D_2 = 1.96 \, D_1
\]

Using the second ratio:
\[
2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \implies \left(2.3\right)^2 = \frac{D_3}{D_2} \implies D_3 = 5.29 \, D_2
\]

Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 \, D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 \, D_2 \):
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, D_1 \approx 10.37 \, D_1
\]

Thus, the distance of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.37 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio
Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star):

\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]

Taking the ratio of the periods:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 = 10.37 \):
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(10.37\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( 10.37^3 \):
\[
10.37^3 = 10^3 + 3 \cdot 10^2 \cdot 0.37 + 3 \cdot 10 \cdot 0.37^2 + 0.37^3
\]
\[
10.37^3 \approx 1000 + 111 + 4.107 + 0.050653 \approx 1115.1576
\]

Thus:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 \approx 1115.1576
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1115.1576} \approx 33.4
\]
