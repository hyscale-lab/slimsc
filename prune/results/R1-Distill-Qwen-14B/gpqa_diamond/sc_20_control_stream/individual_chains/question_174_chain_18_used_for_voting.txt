Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

Wait, so the initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. But after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99M. So the initial energy isn't all converted into the rest masses; some must have been released as binding energy or something else. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in the MeV range, which is much smaller than GeV, so maybe relativistic effects are minor here.

Let me think about the setup. The nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because of conservation of momentum. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the masses. Let's say the smaller fragment has mass m, so the larger one is 2m. Wait, the problem says the more massive is twice as massive, so m and 2m for the two fragments. The sum is m + 2m = 3m. But according to the problem, this sum is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 ≈ 0.33 M. So the smaller fragment is 0.33 M, and the larger is 0.66 M.

But wait, the initial nucleus's rest mass is M. The total rest mass after is 0.99 M, so there's a mass deficit of 0.01 M. That's probably where the energy for kinetic comes from.

Wait, but in a nuclear reaction, the kinetic energy comes from the rest mass difference. So the initial rest energy is Mc², and the final rest energy is 0.99 M c². The energy released would be (0.01 M c²) = (300 GeV) * 0.01 = 3 GeV. So that's 3,000 MeV. But the kinetic energy of the fragments can't be more than that.

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So in reality, both fragments will have kinetic energy, but since the more massive one is heavier, perhaps it has less kinetic energy? Or maybe it's the opposite. Wait, in explosions, the heavier piece tends to move slower because of conservation of momentum. So the lighter piece has more speed and thus more kinetic energy.

Wait, let's think about it. The heavier fragment (2m) will have a lower speed than the lighter one (m) because their momenta are equal and opposite. So the lighter fragment might have a higher kinetic energy.

But the problem is specifically about the more massive fragment's kinetic energy, T1.

So I need to calculate T1 using relativistic equations and then subtract the non-relativistic approximation to find the difference.

Hmm, but how to approach this? I remember that in inelastic collisions and explosions, the kinetic energy can be found using conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, the process is fission, so it's like an explosion. So initial momentum is zero. Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v and V, in opposite directions.

In the rest frame, the total momentum after fission is zero, so m v = 2m V. Because momentum is mass times velocity, and their directions are opposite. So m v = 2m V → v = 2 V. So the lighter fragment moves twice as fast as the heavier one in opposite direction.

Wait, no: the masses are m and 2m. So momentum is m v1 = 2m v2. So v1 = 2 v2. Because momentum vectors are opposite, but in magnitude, m v1 = 2m v2 → v1 = 2 v2.

So the lighter fragment moves faster. So its kinetic energy would be higher. But the question is about the more massive fragment's kinetic energy, T1.

So the more massive fragment is 2m. Its kinetic energy is (using relativistic formula) T1 = (gamma -1) m c², but wait, no. Because for the more massive fragment, it's 2m. So T1 is (gamma -1) (2m) c².

Wait, but actually, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times rest mass energy, yes. So gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But from the problem, the initial nucleus is at rest. The rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total rest mass energy is 0.99 M c², which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So the energy released is 3 GeV, which becomes the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, but the rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So the initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV, and the final rest energy is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is all the kinetic energy.

So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

But wait, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So that part is correct.

So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, the final rest energy is 297 GeV, so kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

So the two fragments have a combined kinetic energy of 3 GeV, which is 3000 MeV.

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So I need to find T1, the relativistic one, and compare it with the classical approximation.

Wait, but maybe it's better to approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is 300 GeV (rest mass). The final energy is the sum of rest masses plus kinetic energies.

So:

Initial energy: E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV.

Final energy: E_final = (m + 2m) c² + (K1 + K2) = 3m c² + (K1 + K2).

But 3m = 0.99 M.

So E_final = 0.99 M c² + (K1 + K2) = 297 GeV + (K1 + K2).

From the problem, we know that E_initial = E_final.

So 300 GeV = 297 GeV + (K1 + K2) → K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So that's correct.

But how to find K1 and K2.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must cancel each other.

So for the more massive fragment (mass 2m), its momentum is (2m) v1, and the lighter fragment (mass m) has momentum m v2. Since they're in opposite directions, their magnitudes are equal: 2m v1 = m v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

Wait no, the directions are opposite, so the vectors are in opposite directions. So (2m) v1 = -(m) v2 → 2 v1 = -v2. So v2 = -2 v1. So the lighter fragment moves twice as fast as the more massive one, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but I'm using classical velocities here. But in reality, in relativistic terms, velocities don't add like that. Hmm, but maybe for the initial approximation, I can proceed with the classical case and then adjust.

But perhaps it's better to use relativistic momentum expressions.

The relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v, where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So for each fragment, the momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So:

gamma1 (2m) v1 = gamma2 (m) v2.

But from momentum conservation: 2m gamma1 v1 = m gamma2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

And since the velocities are opposite, v2 = -k v1, where k is a positive number. Let's say v2 = -k v1, so the direction is opposite.

So substituting into the momentum equation: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (k v1) → 2 gamma1 = gamma2 k.

Hmm, but also, the kinetic energies are K1 = (gamma1 -1) (2m c²), and K2 = (gamma2 -1) (m c²).

We also know that K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find the ratio of velocities and then proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the classical approach is an approximation where gamma is taken as 1, so K = ½ m v².

But the problem is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. So I need to compute T1 relativistically and then compute T1_classically, then find the difference, which is T1 - T1_classical.

Wait, but maybe the velocities are such that relativistic effects aren't too significant. Let's see. Since the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is much smaller than the rest mass energies.

The rest mass of each fragment:

The more massive fragment is 2m = (2/3)(0.99 M) ≈ 0.66 M.

M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV / c². So 0.66 M c² is 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV. So the rest mass energy is 198 GeV. The kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is about 1.5% of the rest mass.

So the gamma factor for each fragment would be (K + m c²)/m c². For the more massive fragment, K1 is part of the 3 GeV. So if K1 is, say, 2 GeV, then (2 + 198) / 198 = 200/198 ≈ 1.01, so gamma is about 1.01. So the velocity is small, but not negligible. So relativistic effects will be small but non-zero.

So the difference between relativistic and classical T1 might be a few MeV.

So let me attempt to model this.

We have:

Fragment 1: mass 2m, velocity v.

Fragment 2: mass m, velocity u.

From conservation of momentum:

2m gamma1 v = m gamma2 u.

But because they move in opposite directions, let's say u = -k v, where k is positive.

So:

2 gamma1 v = gamma2 k v → 2 gamma1 = gamma2 k.

From conservation of energy:

E_initial = E_final

300 GeV = (2m c² + m c²) + (K1 + K2) → 300 = 3m c² + (K1 + K2).

But 3m = 0.99 M → 3m c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So K1 = (gamma1 - 1) 2m c²,

K2 = (gamma2 - 1) m c².

So, 2m c² (gamma1 -1) + m c² (gamma2 - 1) = 3 GeV.

But 3m c² = 297 GeV → m c² = 99 GeV.

So substituting:

2*(gamma1 -1)*99 GeV + (gamma2 -1)*99 GeV = 3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV:

2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) = 3/99 → approx 0.0303.

So 2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 = 0.0303 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Earlier, from momentum: 2 gamma1 = gamma2 k.

And from velocity: u = -k v → u = -k v.

But in terms of direction, let's think of their speeds. Let's denote v as the speed of the more massive fragment, and u as the speed of the lighter one. Since momentum is conserved, 2m gamma1 v = m gamma2 u → 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

But if they move in opposite directions, u = -k v → 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 (-k v) → 2 gamma1 = - gamma2 k. But since k and gamma are positive, perhaps I should take magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express u in terms of v. Let's say the more massive fragment moves to the right with speed v, so the lighter one moves to the left with speed u. Then, the momentum is:

2m gamma1 v = m gamma2 u.

So 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

But since u > 0 (to the left, but direction is accounted for in signs), the equation is 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u → u = (2 gamma1 / gamma2) v.

So u is proportional to v, scaled by 2 gamma1 / gamma2.

But this feels a bit stuck. Maybe I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that in the non-relativistic case, the velocities are small, so gamma is approximately 1. Then, the equation becomes:

2m v = m u → u = 2 v.

And the kinetic energies would be (1/2) 2m v² and (1/2) m (2v)^2 = (1/2) m 4 v² = 2 m v².

So K1 = m v²,

K2 = 2 m v².

Total K = 3 m v².

We know that K1 + K2 =3 GeV → 3 m v² =3 GeV → m v² =1 GeV.

So m v² =1 GeV.

But m is 0.33 M, and M c² is 300 GeV. So m c² = (0.33)(300) GeV =99 GeV. So m =99 GeV / c².

So v² = (1 GeV)/(m) = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) * c² → v² = (1/99) c² → v = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c /9.9499 ≈ 0.1005 c.

So v is about 0.1c.

So in this non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is K1 = m v² = (99 GeV/c²) * ( (0.1 c)^2 ) / c^2 → (99 GeV) * (0.01) → 0.99 GeV, or 990 MeV.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck.

Wait, K1 = (1/2) * 2m * v² = m v². So with m =99 GeV/c², v² = (0.1 c)^2 = 0.01 c².

So K1 = (99 GeV/c²) * 0.01 c² = 0.99 GeV → 990 MeV.

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, their kinetic energies add up to 3 GeV, which matches. So that's correct.

But this is the non-relativistic approximation. Now, the correct relativistic calculation would have a different result because gamma is not 1.

So in the relativistic case, to find T1, we need to account for gamma.

But how?

We have the equations:

Equation 1: 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

Equation 2: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303 (from earlier).

And K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

But with K1 = (gamma1 -1) * 2m c²,

K2 = (gamma2 -1) * m c².

Which is:

2m c² (gamma1 -1) + m c² (gamma2 -1) =3 GeV.

We know m c² =99 GeV,

So,

2 *99 (gamma1 -1) +99 (gamma2 -1) =3.

Divide both sides by 99:

2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) = 3/99 → 2 gamma1 -2 + gamma2 -1 = 0.0303.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303. (Equation A)

From Equation 1: 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

But u = (2 gamma1 / gamma2) v (from earlier, non-relativistic case would have u=2v, but relativistic may have a different proportionality). So perhaps we can find another relation between gamma1 and gamma2.

But I think I'm getting stuck on the exact relation. Maybe I can proceed by using a substitution.

Let me denote gamma2 as x gamma1, where x is a factor.

So gamma2 = x gamma1.

Substituting into Equation A:

2 gamma1 + x gamma1 =3.0303 → gamma1 (2 +x )=3.0303 → gamma1 =3.0303/(2 +x).

Now, from Equation 1:

2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

But u = (2 gamma1 / gamma2) v → u = (2/(x)) v.

Wait, but from Equation 1, 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u → u = (2 gamma1 v) / gamma2.

But gamma2 =x gamma1 → u = (2 gamma1 v) / (x gamma1) )= (2 v)/x.

So u = (2 v)/x.

But in terms of velocities, since the two particles are moving in opposite directions, we can write u = (2 v)/x.

But velocity is a vector. Let me think in terms of their speeds.

Wait, probably the speeds are related by u = (2 v)/x. But in reality, their speeds are related by the momentum equation.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the relation between velocities using the relativistic velocity addition?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the kinetic energy is a significant fraction of the rest mass, so I can't ignore it, but maybe I can find another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between gamma1 and gamma2.

Wait, let me think: gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma increases as v approaches c.

But perhaps I can express u in terms of v.

Wait, in Equation 1: 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

So, u = (2 gamma1 v)/gamma2.

But from the earlier substitution, gamma2 =x gamma1.

So u = (2 gamma1 v)/(x gamma1) )= (2v)/(x).

So u = (2/x) v.

But the velocities are related. So, the ratio of u to v is 2/x.

But since the two are moving in opposite directions, their speeds are positive, so the ratio is just a scalar.

So, u = (2/x) v.

Now, let's think about the kinetic energies.

K1 = (gamma1 -1) (2m c²) = (gamma1 -1) (198 GeV).

K2 = (gamma2 -1) (m c²) )= (x gamma1 -1) (99 GeV).

So, K1 + K2 = 198 (gamma1 -1) +99 (x gamma1 -1) =3 GeV.

Divide by 99:

2 (gamma1 -1) + (x gamma1 -1 )= 3/99 → 2 gamma1 -2 +x gamma1 -1 = 0.0303.

So,

(2 +x) gamma1 =3.0303.

Which is the same as equation A.

So, from equation A: gamma1 =3.0303/(2 +x).

But we need another equation to find x.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relation between gamma1 and gamma2 via the velocities.

Wait, let's consider the velocity of fragment 1 (more massive) is v, and fragment 2 is u.

We have:

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

gamma2 =1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

And from Equation 1:

2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

But u= (2v)/x.

So,

2 gamma1 v = gamma2 * (2v)/x.

Cancel v (assuming v is non-zero):

2 gamma1 = gamma2 (2)/x → gamma1 = (gamma2 (2))/(2x) )= gamma2 /x.

So gamma1 = gamma2 /x.

But earlier, we set gamma2 =x gamma1.

So substituting gamma2 =x gamma1 into gamma1 = gamma2/x → gamma1 = (x gamma1)/x → gamma1=gamma1 → which is a tautology, so no new information.

Hmm, perhaps I can write the velocities in terms of each other.

Let me consider that:

u = (2v)/x.

But gamma2 = x gamma1.

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

gamma2 =1/sqrt(1 -u²/c²) =x gamma1.

So,

1/sqrt(1 -u²/c²) =x / sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

Square both sides:

1/(1 -u²/c²) =x²/(1 -v²/c²).

Rearranged:

(1 -v²/c²) =x² (1 -u²/c²).

But u =2v/(x). So u²=4v²/(x²).

Substitute into equation:

1 - v²/c² =x² [1 - (4 v²)/(x² c²) ) ].

Simplify the right side:

x² [1 - (4 v²)/(x² c²) ) ] = x² - (4 v²)/(c²).

So,

1 - (v²/c²) = x² - (4 v²)/(c²).

Rearranging:

1 = x² + (v²/c²) - (4 v^2)/(c^2).

→ 1 = x² - (3 v²)/(c²).

Hmm, that's one equation.

But we still have variables x and v.

Wait, but perhaps we can find another equation involving x and v.

Earlier, from equation A, gamma1 =3.0303/(2+x).

And we have:

gamma1 =1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) =3.0303/(2 +x).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 -v²/c²) = (3.0303)^2/( (2 +x)^2 ).

We'll call this equation B.

So,

(2 +x)^2 = (3.0303)^2 (1 -v²/c²).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can make some substitutions.

Wait, from the other equation:

1 = x² - (3 v²)/(c²) → x² =1 + (3 v²)/(c²).

We can write that as x² =1 + (3 v^2)/(c^2).

But also, from equation B:

(2 +x)^2 = (3.0303)^2 (1 -v²/c^2).

Let me compute (3.0303)^2. 3.0303 is approximately 3.03, so (3.03)^2 is about 9.18.

So,

(2 +x)^2 ≈9.18 (1 -v²/c^2).

But from earlier, x² =1 + 3 v²/c² → v²/c² = (x² -1)/3.

Substituting into equation B:

(2 +x)^2 =9.18 (1 - (x² -1)/3 ) → 9.18 [ (3 -x² +1 ) /3 ] → 9.18 * (4 -x²)/3.

Compute 9.18 /3 ≈3.06.

So,

(2 +x)^2 =3.06 (4 -x²).

Expand left side: 4 +4x +x².

Right side: 3.06 *4 =12.24 → 12.24 -3.06 x².

So equation becomes:

4 +4x +x² =12.24 -3.06 x².

Bring all terms to left:

4 +4x +x² -12.24 +3.06 x² =0 → (1+3.06) x² +4x + (4-12.24)=0 →4.06 x² +4x -8.24=0.

This is a quadratic equation: a=4.06, b=4, c= -8.24.

Using quadratic formula, x= [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a).

Compute discriminant:

b²-4ac=16 -4*4.06*(-8.24).

4 *4.06=16.24.

16.24 *8.24= let's compute 16*8=128, 16*0.24=3.84, 0.24*8=1.92, 0.24*0.24=0.0576 → total is (16+0.24)(8.24)= (16.24)(8.24)= let me compute 16 *8=128, 16 *0.24=3.84, 0.24 *8=1.92, 0.24 *0.24=0.0576.

So 16.24 *8.24=16*8 +16*0.24 +0.24*8 +0.24² → 128 + 3.84 +1.92 +0.0576 → 128 +5.76 +0.0576 =133.76 +0.0576= 133.8176.

So discriminant is 16 +4*4.06*8.24 → 16 +16.24*8.24.

Wait, no, the discriminant is b² -4ac. So:

4ac=4 *4.06 *8.24 →4 *4.06 is 16.24 →16.24 *8.24=16.24 *8 +16.24 *0.24 →129.92 +3.8976=133.8176.

So, discriminant is 16 +133.8176 →149.8176.

sqrt(149.8176) ≈12.24.

So,

x= [ -4 ±12.24 ]/(2*4.06 )= [8.24 or -16.24 ]/(8.12).

Only positive solution makes sense since gamma is always positive.

So x=(8.24)/(8.12)≈1.0148.

So x≈1.0148.

So gamma2 =x gamma1=1.0148 gamma1.

Now, from equation A:

2 gamma1 + gamma2=3.0303 →2 gamma1 +1.0148 gamma1=3.0303 → (3.0148) gamma1=3.0303 → gamma1=3.0303/3.0148≈1.0051.

So gamma1≈1.0051.

So gamma2=1.0148 *1.0051≈1.0199.

Now, gamma1=1.0051 → v is small.

v= sqrt(1 -1/(gamma1²)) c.

gamma1²≈1.0102 →1/gamma1²≈0.9900.

So 1 -0.9900=0.01 → v= sqrt(0.01 ) c=0.1 c.

Which matches the non-relativistic case. So v=0.1 c.

Now, compute the kinetic energy T1.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) * (2m c²).

2m c² =2 *99 GeV=198 GeV.

gamma1=1.0051 → gamma1 -1=0.0051.

So T1=0.0051 *198 GeV =1.01 GeV →1010 MeV.

Wait, but what about the non-relativistic case? In the non-relativistic case, T1 was 990 MeV. So the relativistic value is 1010 MeV.

So the difference is 1010 MeV -990 MeV=20 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check:

In the non-relativistic case, T1 was m v² =99 GeV/c² * (0.1 c)^2 →99 GeV *0.01=0.99 GeV=990 MeV.

In the relativistic case, T1 is 1.01 GeV=1010 MeV. The difference is 20 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 1010 MeV, classical is 990 MeV. The difference is 20 MeV.

So the answer should be 20 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 20 MeV.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations.

Wait: gamma1=1.0051, so gamma1-1=0.0051.

2m= 198 GeV.

So T1=0.0051 *198 =1.01 GeV → 1010 MeV.

Non-relativistic T1=990 MeV.

Difference is 1010 -990=20 MeV.

So the correct answer is D) 20 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy and momentum conservation during the nuclear fission. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV and splits into two fragments with rest masses in a 2:1 ratio. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, meaning the energy released in the fission is 3 GeV, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses of fragments**:  
   - Let the lighter fragment have mass \( m \), so the heavier fragment has mass \( 2m \).  
   - The total rest mass of the fragments is \( 3m = 0.99M \), so \( m = \frac{0.99M}{3} \).  
   - The rest mass energy of the lighter fragment is \( m c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \), and the heavier fragment is \( 2m c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Energy conservation**:  
   - The total energy released is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments:  
     \[
     K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

3. **Momentum conservation**:  
   - The initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
     \[
     2m \gamma_1 v_1 = m \gamma_2 v_2.
     \]
   - This simplifies to \( 2\gamma_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 v_2 \). Since the lighter fragment moves faster, \( v_2 = 2v_1 \).

4. **Relativistic kinetic energy**:  
   - The kinetic energy of each fragment is given by:  
     \[
     K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) \cdot 2m c^2, \quad K_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) \cdot m c^2.
     \]
   - Substituting \( m c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \), we have:  
     \[
     K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) \cdot 198, \quad K_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) \cdot 99.
     \]

5. **Relating \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \)**:  
   - Using momentum conservation and the relationship between \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \), we find:  
     \[
     2\gamma_1 = \gamma_2.
     \]
   - Substituting \( \gamma_2 = 2\gamma_1 \) into the energy conservation equation:  
     \[
     2(\gamma_1 - 1) \cdot 99 + (\gamma_2 - 1) \cdot 99 = 3.
     \]
   - Simplifying, we find \( \gamma_1 \approx 1.0051 \) and \( \gamma_2 \approx 1.0102 \).

6. **Kinetic energy of the heavier fragment**:  
   - The relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:  
     \[
     K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) \cdot 198 = (1.0051 - 1) \cdot 198 \approx 1.01 \, \text{GeV} = 1010 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

7. **Classical approximation**:  
   - In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is:  
     \[
     K_{1,\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} (2m) v^2.
     \]
   - Using \( v = 0.1c \) (derived from energy conservation in the classical case), we find:  
     \[
     K_{1,\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 198 \cdot (0.1c)^2 = 990 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

8. **Difference between relativistic and classical kinetic energy**:  
   - The difference is:  
     \[
     \Delta K = K_1 - K_{1,\text{classical}} = 1010 \, \text{MeV} - 990 \, \text{MeV} = 20 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **20 MeV**.
