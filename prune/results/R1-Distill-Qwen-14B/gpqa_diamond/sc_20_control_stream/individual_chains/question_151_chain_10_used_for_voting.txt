Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in a three-dimensional space. I think in quantum mechanics, the state is a ket vector, so maybe it's written as a column vector like:

[-1]
[ 2]
[ 1]

Wait, but wait a second. In quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. So let's check that. (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. So the total is 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm squared is 6. So the state isn't normalized. Hmm. But for probabilities, maybe we need to normalize it first. Or does that not matter for the observable's expectation? Wait, the observable's expectation value calculation involves the inner product, so perhaps normalization is needed. Let me think: the state vector should have a norm of 1 for probabilities to add up to 1. So I think I need to normalize this state.

So the first step is to normalize the state vector. The current vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by each component. So the state becomes:

[-1/sqrt(6)]
[ 2/sqrt(6)]
[ 1/sqrt(6)]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). So, to get the unit vector, we divide each component by the norm. So the normalized state is [ -1, 2, 1 ] divided by sqrt(6). So each component is multiplied by 1/sqrt(6).

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The problem states that P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P looks like:

[ 0        1/sqrt(2)    0      ]
[1/sqrt(2)  0         1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)    0      ]

So that's the matrix P. Now, the question is asking for the probability that a measurement of P yields 0 at time t.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So, the possible measurement results are the eigenvalues of P. But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 when P is measured. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P that correspond to the eigenvalue 0, and then find the projection of the state onto those eigenvectors. The square of the magnitude of that projection gives the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value, but no, that gives the average. The probability is more directly calculated using the eigenstates.

Wait, but perhaps another way. The observable P is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So if 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

So first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the matrix P and see if it's a projection operator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a measurement of P yields 0 is equal to the trace of the projection operator onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, multiplied by the state.

Wait, maybe to approach it step by step.

Step 1: Find the eigenvalues of P.

Let me compute the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me construct the matrix (P - λ I):

Row 1: [ -λ , 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

So the determinant is:

| -λ    1/sqrt(2)     0      |
|1/sqrt(2)  -λ     1/sqrt(2)|
|0     1/sqrt(2)    -λ      |

Calculating the determinant would give me the characteristic equation.

Let me expand this determinant.

Using the first row for expansion:

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ ] ] ) 
- 1/sqrt(2) * det( [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ ] ] )
+ 0 * det(... )

So the determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ]
- (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ]
+ 0

Simplify each term.

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ) ]

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ/sqrt(2)) ]

Third term: 0.

So first term is: -λ (λ² - 1/2 )

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (1/sqrt(2))*(λ/sqrt(2)) ) = λ (1/2 )

So putting it all together:

det = -λ(λ² - 1/2 ) + λ/2 
= -λ^3 + (1/2)λ + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + λ

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² )=0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So the observable P can take values 0, 1, or -1.

The question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0, and then find the projection of the state onto that eigenspace.

So, for λ=0, the eigenvectors satisfy (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So, the eigenspace is the nullspace of P.

Let me construct the matrix P:

Row 1: 0    1/sqrt(2)   0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2)  0    1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0    1/sqrt(2)   0

So, to find the nullspace, solve P v = 0.

So, the system of equations:

Equation 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Equation 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

So from equations 1 and 3, v2 must be zero.

From equation 2: v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]^T is an eigenvector.

Therefore, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1)^T.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state onto this eigenspace.

But the state is normalized, right? Wait, earlier I thought the initial state was [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, which has a norm sqrt(6), so the normalized state is [ (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

So let me proceed with this normalized state.

The projection onto the eigenspace is given by the inner product between the state and the eigenvector (or any vector in the eigenspace). Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's enough to compute the inner product with the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but the eigenvector I found is [1, 0, -1]^T. Let me normalize that.

The norm of [1,0,-1]^T is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So, the projection of the state onto this eigenvector is their inner product.

The state is [ (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

So the inner product is:

( (-1)/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

Adding them together: [ (-2)/(sqrt(12)) ) ].

Wait, no, let me compute each term:

Term 1: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Term 3: (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Adding term1 and term3: (-1/(2√3)) + (-1/(2√3)) = (-2/(2√3)) )= (-1)/√3.

Wait, but wait:

Wait, the inner product is:

( (-1/sqrt(6)) )*(1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)) )

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

So that's [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ] + [ (-1) / sqrt(12) ) ]

Which is [ -2 / sqrt(12) ) ] → sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 2/sqrt(12) = 2/(2√3) )= 1/√3.

So the inner product is (-1/√3 ) + (-1/√3 ) = (-2)/(√3 ) → Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me recompute.

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

So each term is -1/(2 sqrt(3)), and there are two such terms.

So total is (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) × 2 → (-1/ sqrt(3)).

So the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the magnitude of this value. The magnitude is the absolute value, so | (-1/sqrt(3)) | is 1/sqrt(3).

Squaring that gives (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Wait, that's one third. So the probability is 1/3.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: The probability is the squared inner product between the state and the eigenvector (normalized).

So normalized state is |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

The eigenvector for λ=0 is |v> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

Inner product <v|ψ> is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) )

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

So that's two terms each of (-1)/(sqrt(12)).

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so each term is (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So two terms add up to (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

So looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

The state of the system is given as a column vector \((-1, 2, 1)^T\), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as \(\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}\). Therefore, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The observable \(P\) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \(P = 0\), we first determine the eigenvalues of \(P\). Solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\), the eigenvalues are found to be \(\lambda = 0, 1, -1\). For \(\lambda = 0\), the corresponding eigenvectors satisfy \(Pv = 0\). Solving this, the eigenspace for \(\lambda = 0\) is spanned by the vector \((1, 0, -1)^T\). Normalizing this eigenvector gives:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is the square of the projection of \(|\psi\rangle\) onto \(|v\rangle\). The projection (inner product) is:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the magnitude of this value:

\[
P(0) = \left| \langle v | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).
