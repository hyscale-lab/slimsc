Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment. Hmm, I need to figure out what's going on here.

Alright, let's break down the problem. Mike designed a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal was to minimize gas molecules to improve electron microscopy. But, even in that vacuum, some gas particles remained. He measured the mean free path as λ1.

Wait, mean free path. I remember that the mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is pressure. Or maybe it's another formula? Oh wait, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the collision cross-section, σ. The formula is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density. Alternatively, another form is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), since n is proportional to P/(k*T).

So, when the pressure is lower, the mean free path increases because the molecules don't collide as often. That makes sense because in a vacuum, there's less gas, so particles can travel further before hitting something.

Now, Mike started the electron beam and noticed that the mean free path changed. It was no longer λ1 but became λ2. The temperature remained the same, so T is the same. What else could affect the mean free path?

Oh wait, when the electron beam is active, it's generating a lot of energy. High-energy electrons can cause various effects. One thing I can think of is gas ionization. The electrons can ionize the gas molecules in the compartment. Ionized gas molecules might behave differently.

If the gas is ionized, the mean free path could change. Let me think: ionized molecules have different properties. Maybe the collision cross-section changes because the ions have different sizes or charges. Alternatively, the presence of charged particles could affect how they move.

Wait, but actually, another effect comes into play. The electrons from the beam can cause secondary electron emission, but that's more about the samples. Alternatively, the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be excited or ionized, leading to more collisions or changes in the gas's state.

Wait, but perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to expand or change density. Or perhaps the ions are getting accelerated by the electric fields from the electron beam, which might affect their motion and thus the mean free path.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it's producing a high electric field. This might cause the gas molecules to move more in a particular direction, perhaps leading to a different effective pressure or number density in the region where the electrons are passing through.

Wait, but the overall pressure is still the same because the pumps are running, right? The problem states that the mean free path changed, but the temperature is the same. So the only variables are factors that affect λ without changing P or T.

Hmm, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become partially ionized. So the gas isn't just neutral molecules anymore. If some molecules are ions, their mass changes, which affects how they move. Or maybe the ions have a different interaction cross-section with the electrons.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the mean free path might actually increase because the ions are more likely to move faster or perhaps the number density decreases due to ionization (since each ionization could remove a molecule and produce ions, but I'm not sure about that).

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam creates an electric field that affects the motion of the ions. For example, charged particles might experience a force, leading to changes in their velocity distribution. But I'm not sure how that would directly affect the mean free path of the gas molecules in terms of collisions.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path as calculated by λ1 is based on the assumption that the gas is neutral and in thermal equilibrium. When the electron beam is active, the gas might not be in thermal equilibrium anymore because the beam is adding energy. This could cause heating locally, but the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, the beam might cause the gas to become more rarified (lower pressure) in the region of interest because the electrons are repelling the gas molecules, pushing them away. If the effective pressure in that region is lower, then the mean free path would be longer.

Wait, but the overall pressure in the sample compartment is still below 1e-9 Torr. So maybe in the area where the electrons are passing through, the local pressure is lower. Because the electrons are high-energy, they could be clearing a path, or perhaps the gas is being expelled from the beam's path due to some effect.

Wait, but the sample compartment is under ultra-high vacuum, so the gas is already minimal. Another thought: when the electron beam is on, it can cause gas molecules to be scattered more, perhaps in a way that their mean free path in the direction of the beam is longer. Or maybe the beam induces some motion that reduces the effective number of collisions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1.

The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22*λ1

B) λ2=λ1, so Mike's observation is wrong.

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1.

So, what's λ based on? It's the average distance between collisions. If something happens that causes the gas to have a longer mean free path, λ2 would be larger than λ1. If it's shorter, λ2 is smaller.

What could cause the mean free path to decrease? If the density of the gas increases, which would mean more collisions. But in the scenario, the pump is maintaining the same overall pressure, so the density is the same. Unless the beam affects the local density.

Wait, but the mean free path is a function of pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. If the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, the ions have a different mass. But wait, if the gas is ionized, the number of particles might change. Because ionization could split a molecule into two or more charged particles. So, perhaps the number density increases. Because, for example, one molecule becomes two ions. If that's the case, the number density n would be higher, which would decrease the mean free path, since λ is inversely proportional to n.

Wait, but in the case of ionization, you're trading one molecule for two ions. Let's say a molecule with mass M becomes two ions each with mass m (maybe same as M, but depends on the ionization). The number of particles would double. So n would be twice as high as before. So the mean free path would be (1/(n σ))^(1/2) or something like that. So if n increases, λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but wait. The pressure is measured as the same, but the composition of the gas has changed. Pressure is related to n and temperature (PV = nRT). If n increases but T stays the same, then pressure would go up. But in the problem, the pressure is maintained at <1e-9 Torr, so the pressure hasn't changed. So if the number of particles increases (n), but pressure is fixed, that would imply that the temperature must have increased. But the problem says the temperature is the same. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization doesn't change the total pressure because the ions contribute to the pressure. Wait, but in terms of ideal gas law, pressure depends on the number of particles and their mass. Wait, no, the ideal gas law is P = (nRT)/M, where M is molar mass. Wait, no, actually, the ideal gas law is P = (nRT)/(V), where n is the number of moles. So if a gas is ionized and the number of particles increases, but the pressure remains the same, then n must have increased. But if n increases, the pressure would go up unless T decreases, which it's not.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think again. The initial mean free path λ1 was calculated under the assumption that the gas is neutral, non-ionized. But when the electron beam is on, the gas is more ionized. So, for example, if each molecule splits into two ions, the number of particles doubles. So the number density n would double. Since λ is inversely proportional to n (λ ~ 1/n), λ would be half as before, so λ2 = λ1/2, which is smaller than λ1. So option C says λ2 < λ1.

But wait, but does ionization affect the cross-section σ? Because the mean free path λ is 1/(√2 n σ). If the cross-section changes, that would affect λ as well.

Ionized particles might have a different collision cross-section. For example, ions have a charge, so they might interact more strongly, increasing the cross-section. If σ increases, then λ decreases, because λ is inversely proportional to σ.

So if both n and σ increase, then λ would decrease even more.

Thus, in the presence of the electron beam, the mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but why? Because the beam is causing more ionization, so the number of particles (n) increases, and their cross-section (σ) increases as well, leading to a lower λ.

So the conclusion is that λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, another angle: when the electron beam is active, it's possible that the gas is being heated, but the problem states that the temperature remains the same. So maybe other factors are at play.

Another thought: Could the electron beam cause gas molecules to move faster, thus increasing the mean free path? Because higher speed would mean that on average, the molecules can go further before colliding. But wait, if the number density is the same, but speed is higher, then λ would increase, because λ ~ (velocity)/(collision rate). So higher velocity would lead to longer λ.

But wait, the collision rate is proportional to nσv, where v is the velocity. So if v increases, collision rate increases, which would decrease λ. Wait, no. Let me think. The mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ v). Because the time between collisions is 1/(n σ v), and the distance is v multiplied by that time. So λ = v / (n σ). So if v increases, λ increases, for constant n and σ. But in our case, n might not be constant. If ionization increases n, then even if v increases, the effect of higher n could dominate.

So, if the electron beam is causing the molecules to ionize, leading to higher n (double, for example), and perhaps higher velocity due to ionization (maybe ions are lighter?), then λ could either increase or decrease depending on which effect is stronger.

Wait, but in reality, when gas is ionized, the ions are likely to have different masses. For example, if a molecule breaks into two smaller ions, each ion has lower mass. Lower mass would mean higher velocity at the same temperature (since KE is (1/2)mv², so v ~ sqrt(2 KE/m). So, lighter particles would move faster.

So, in that case, n is higher, but v is higher. How does that affect λ? λ = v/(n σ). Let's see.

If n doubles, and v doubles, then λ remains the same if σ remains the same. But if σ increases because the ions have charge and larger cross-sections, then λ would decrease.

Alternatively, if the ions are smaller (like atomic ions instead of molecular), perhaps the cross-section σ would decrease. Hmm, that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section depends more on the size of the particles. For example, atomic ions are smaller than molecules, so σ would be smaller, leading to a larger λ.

Wait, but molecules are made up of atoms, so if a molecule breaks into atoms, the cross-section might be similar or smaller? I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too speculative. Let me think of another approach.

The initial λ1 is determined without the electron beam, under ultra-high vacuum conditions. When the beam is turned on, the gas is ionized, leading to a change in the mean free path.

In a typical electron microscope, the electron beam can cause the gas to ionize, leading to a phenomenon called electron-induced desorption, where the sample outgases. But here, the sample is in a vacuum, so perhaps the gas in the compartment is being ionized.

In terms of the mean free path, the ionized gas may have a lower or higher mean free path depending on the scenario.

Wait, another thought: if the gas is ionized, the ions can be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, leading to a change in their velocity distribution. However, given that the temperature is the same, perhaps the thermal velocity is the same, but the ions might have additional velocities from the beam's electric fields. But this would complicate the mean free path.

Alternatively, could the presence of the beam cause gas molecules to be repelled, effectively lowering the pressure in the region where the beam is passing? That is, the high-energy electrons could push the gas away, making the local pressure lower, which would increase the mean free path in that area.

But the overall pressure in the compartment is maintained by the pumps, so the local pressure might not be significantly different. Unless the beam's effect is strong enough in the small region where the electrons pass through.

Wait, but the problem states that the mean free path is now λ2. So, the overall mean free path has changed. If the effective pressure in the compartment is the same, but the gas is ionized, then perhaps the mean free path is shorter because the number of particles is higher.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized and the ions are moving faster, the mean free path could be longer. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the formula again. The mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the molecular diameter. Alternatively, λ = 1/(√2 * n * π d²).

If the number of particles (n) increases because of ionization, and d remains the same (if each ion is about the same size as the original molecule), then λ would decrease.

But wait, what if the ionization leads to smaller particles? Like, if a molecule breaks into smaller ions, their diameter d would be smaller. So if d decreases, λ would increase, because λ is inversely proportional to d².

So, if d is smaller, λ is larger.

So, in that case, the mean free path could increase.

Wait, but in reality, when a gas is ionized, the size of the particles (ions) might be similar to the neutral molecules, or perhaps smaller if they're atoms. For instance, if the gas is molecular (like H2 or O2), ionization would break them into H+ or O+ ions, which are smaller than the neutral molecules. So, in that case, d decreases, leading to λ increasing.

But the change in n depends on how many ions are formed per molecule. For example, if each molecule produces two ions, n doubles. So, if n doubles and d is halved (assuming atoms are half the size of the molecule), then λ would be (1/(n σ)) becomes (1/(2n * (d/2)^2 * π )), since σ is π d² for a spherical particle.

Wait, σ is the collision cross-section. For a sphere, σ = π d². So, if d decreases by a factor of 2, σ becomes π (d/2)^2 = π d²/4. So σ = (d²/4) * π.

So, putting it all together:

Original λ1 = 1/(√2 * n1 * π d1² )

After ionization, n2 = 2 n1 (if each molecule splits into two ions), and d2 = d1 /2.

Thus, λ2 = 1/(√2 * n2 * π d2² ) = 1/(√2 * 2 n1 * π (d1/2)^2 )

Simplify d1/2 squared: (d1²)/4.

So λ2 = 1/(√2 * 2 n1 * π * (d1² /4) )

Which simplifies to:

λ2 = 1/( (√2 n1 π d1²) ) * (4)/(2 * 1) )

= (4)/(2) * (1/(√2 n1 π d1² )) )

= 2 * (1/(√2 n1 π d1² )) )

But λ1 = 1/(√2 n1 π d1² )

So λ2 = 2 * λ1.

Wait, that would make λ2 = 2 λ1, which is greater than λ1. So in this case, λ2 is larger than λ1.

But that's conflicting with my earlier thought where I thought λ would decrease. Hmm.

But wait, the calculation shows a doubling. So in this case, λ2 would be twice λ1. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

So if λ2 is 2 λ1, then option A would apply.

But wait, in reality, when a molecule ionizes into two ions, the number of particles doubles. Each ion has a smaller size (d), which would make their cross-section σ smaller. So, the number density is higher, but the cross-section is lower, and the effect on λ depends on which factor is more dominant.

In the calculation above, λ2 ends up being twice as big as λ1. So λ2=2 λ1.

But this seems to contradict the earlier thought that λ would decrease. So perhaps my initial assumption that n would double is incorrect? Or perhaps in reality, when a molecule ionizes, the number of particles increases, but the cross-sectional area per particle decreases, leading to an overall uncertainty on whether λ increases or decreases.

Wait, let's re-express the mean free path formula more accurately.

The mean free path is given by:

λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ )

Where n is the number density, and σ is the collision cross-section.

If a molecule ionizes into two ions, n becomes 2n0 (where n0 was the initial number density). Each ion has a cross-section σ_i.

If the ions are smaller, σ_i = π (d_i)^2, where d_i < d.

Assuming each ion is half the size of the original molecule (d_i = d/2), then σ_i = π (d/2)^2 = π d² /4.

So, now, n is 2n0, and σ is π d² /4.

So, λ_after = 1/(√2 * 2n0 * (π d² /4) )

= 1/(√2 * 2n0 * π d² /4 )

= [1/(√2 n0 π d² ) ] * (4/(2)) )

= [1/(√2 n0 π d² ) ] * 2

But λ_before was:

λ_before = 1/(√2 n0 π d² )

So, λ_after = 2 * λ_before.

So in this scenario, λ2 is twice λ1.

But why is that? Because although the number density doubles, the cross-section per ion is a quarter, leading to a net increase in λ.

Wait, but that's not matching with the previous thought. So, perhaps the mean free path actually increases upon ionization. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the problem states that Mike found the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So, which option fits?

If λ2 is greater, the options are A or D.

Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. So 2 >1.22, so if λ2 is twice as big, option A would be correct.

But wait, why would the mean free path increase when the electron beam is on? Because the gas is ionized, which leads to a higher mean free path.

But I thought that higher number density would decrease λ, but in this case, the cross-section decreased even more, leading to a net increase in λ.

So, in this scenario, λ2 would be larger than λ1, which suggests option A is correct.

But wait, the initial calculation shows λ2=2λ1. So why is option A is >=1.22? Because 2 is certainly >=1.22.

But wait, the question says that Mike observed that the mean free path was now λ2. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

But wait, another possibility: the electron beam could cause the gas to be excited, but keep the same pressure and temperature. How would that affect λ?

Or, perhaps the electron beam introduces additional forces, such as electric fields, which cause the gas to move in a particular direction, perhaps leading to a lower effective pressure in the beam's path. For example, the ions might be accelerated away from the beam, reducing the number density in that region. If the number density is lower, λ would be higher.

Wait, but the overall pressure is maintained, so perhaps the local pressure in the vicinity of the beam is lower, making λ higher in that area.

But the question refers to the mean free path of the gas in the sample compartment. So, perhaps the overall mean free path in the entire compartment could change if the gas density varies due to the beam.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: think of the possible reasons why the mean free path would change when the electron beam is on.

Another possibility is that when the electron beam is on, the gas is more likely to scatter the electrons, which causes the electrons to lose energy and perhaps the gas to heat up. But the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, but perhaps the electron beam induces a current or an electric field that affects the motion of the gas ions. For example, ions might be accelerated, leading to higher velocities. This would increase the mean free path, as λ is proportional to velocity.

Wait, but if the ions are moving faster, but the number density increases, it's not clear which effect dominates. Let me think.

If velocity increases and n increases, but the cross-section could change, it's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is more likely to undergo inelastic collisions when the beam is on, leading to changes in the gas's properties.

Wait, but perhaps the key is to recall that in the presence of an electron beam, the gas is more likely to be ionized, and ionized gas (plasma) has different behavior. In a plasma, the mean free path can be significantly longer because the collisions are less frequent due to screening effects. Wait, no, in a plasma, the mean free path for electrons is very short because of the screening. But for ions, perhaps it's longer.

Alternatively, in a plasma, the ions have a Debye length, beyond which the electric field is screened. So, within the Debye length, the electric field is screened, which affects the behavior of the ions.

But I'm not sure how this directly affects the mean free path of the gas molecules.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of mean free path in the presence of an electron beam.

The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. When the electron beam is active, it's introducing a high-energy beam that could cause the gas to ionize. The presence of ions might change the way molecules collide. Alternatively, the beam could cause the gas to expand, lowering the pressure locally, which would increase the mean free path.

But the problem states that the overall pressure remains the same, so the expansion might not affect the entire compartment.

Alternatively, the beam could cause the gas to be expelled from the beam's path, making the local pressure lower in that area. So, in regions where the beam passes, the gas density is lower, leading to a longer mean free path. But the overall mean free path of the entire compartment might not change much, unless the beam affects a significant portion of the compartment.

But Mike observed that the mean free path changed, which suggests that he was measuring a different λ2 than λ1. So perhaps λ2 is longer than λ1.

Wait, but why would λ2 be longer? Because the gas is ionized, and perhaps the cross-section is smaller. Or because the gas is more rarified due to the beam's influence.

So, combining all these thoughts, perhaps the mean free path λ2 is longer than λ1.

This would make option A or D the possibilities. But option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1, which is a significant increase.

Another approach: think about the effect of ionization on gas properties. When gas is ionized, the number of collisions between neutral molecules decreases because some of them are ions. So, the effective number density of neutral molecules is lower. Thus, the mean free path for neutral molecules would increase.

Wait, but in the case where the gas is mostly neutral, the presence of ions might not affect the neutral molecules' mean free paths that much. But if the gas becomes ionized, then the number of neutral molecules decreases, leading to a lower n for neutral particles, thus increasing their mean free path.

So, in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So, the correct answer would be option A: λ2 >=1.22 λ1.

Wait, but why 1.22? Where does that number come from?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately the square root of (π/2), which comes into the calculation of the mean free path. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's a factor related to the scattering angle or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas is excited and the mean free path increases by a factor of about 1.22.

But I'm not certain. However, based on the earlier calculation where λ2 ended up being twice λ1 when considering both n and σ changes, I think that λ2 would be larger than λ1, so the correct answer is A or D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial λ1 was determined when the compartment was under ultra-high vacuum, but some gas remained. Upon turning on the electron beam, the gas is ionized. So, in terms of neutral molecules, their number density is lower because some are ionized. Thus, for the neutral molecules, their effective number density is lower, leading to a longer mean free path.

Wait, but that's for the neutrals. The mean free path of the gas (including ions) would be a combination of neutral and ion behavior.

Alternatively, maybe Mike observed an increase in the mean free path because the ions have a longer mean free path, and since the ions are the majority, the overall λ2 is longer.

If that's the case, then λ2 is longer than λ1.

So, the correct answer would be either A or D.

Wait, but why would the mean free path increase when the beam is on? Because the gas is ionized, leading to a lower number of neutral molecules, and the ions have a longer mean free path.

Alternatively, in the presence of the beam, the gas is ionized, and the ions have a longer mean free path, leading to an overall λ2 larger than λ1.

Thus, based on this reasoning, the correct answer is A: λ2 >=1.22 λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) when the electron beam is activated. Initially, the mean free path is λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Upon activating the electron beam, Mike observes a new mean free path, λ2, which differs from λ1. The question asks how λ2 compares to λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \, n \, \sigma}
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number density of gas particles, and \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section. Factors affecting \(\lambda\) include \(n\), \(\sigma\), and the properties of the gas.

2. **Effect of Electron Beam**: When the electron beam is activated, it ionizes some gas molecules. Ionization increases the number of particles (e.g., one molecule splits into two ions), effectively doubling \(n\). However, ionized particles (ions) are typically smaller than neutral molecules, reducing \(\sigma\) because the collision cross-section depends on the particle size (\(\sigma \propto d^2\), where \(d\) is the particle diameter).

3. **Net Effect on \(\lambda\)**:
   - Increased \(n\) tends to decrease \(\lambda\).
   - Decreased \(\sigma\) (due to smaller ion sizes) tends to increase \(\lambda\).
   - The interplay between these effects determines the overall change in \(\lambda\). In this case, the reduction in \(\sigma\) dominates, leading to an increase in \(\lambda\).

4. **Calculation**: Assuming each molecule splits into two ions, \(n\) doubles, and the ion size is halved (\(d_i = d/2\)), the new mean free path becomes:
   \[
   \lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \, (2n) \, \left(\pi (d/2)^2\right)} = 2 \lambda_1
   \]
   This shows that \(\lambda_2\) is significantly larger than \(\lambda_1\).

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This is consistent with the calculation, as \(\lambda_2 = 2 \lambda_1\), which is greater than \(1.22 \lambda_1\).
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: Incorrect, as the electron beam changes the gas properties, altering \(\lambda\).
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: Incorrect, as the mean free path increases due to ionization.
   - **Option D (\(1.22 \lambda_1 > \lambda_2 > \lambda_1\))**: Incorrect, as \(\lambda_2\) is not between \(1.22 \lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_1\); it is significantly larger than \(\lambda_1\).

### Conclusion:
The mean free path \(\lambda_2\) is greater than \(\lambda_1\), and the correct answer is consistent with \(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\).

**Answer: A**
