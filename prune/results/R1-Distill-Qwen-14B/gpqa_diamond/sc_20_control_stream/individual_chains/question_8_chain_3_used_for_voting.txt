Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The experiment is about finding genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. The setup is that they have three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also double mutants.

The main thing I remember from genetics is that when you have mutants with varying levels of resistance, you can infer the relationships between the genes. The question mentions that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So transcription factors usually regulate other genes, right?

The data shows the resistance levels for each mutant and the double mutants. The control is 100% resistance, which is the wild type. Let's list the results:

- g1: 75% → So their resistance is reduced by 25% compared to wild type.
- g2: 0% → No resistance at all. So this plant is super susceptible.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance of the wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → Also no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → No resistance.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out the genetic relationships based on these results. Let's think about each double mutant.

First, for the double mutants. If you have two mutations and the resistance is worse than each individual, it might suggest that the genes are in the same pathway. Or perhaps they function additively.

Looking at g2: it's 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that is critical for resistance. Because without it, the plant can't resist the disease at all.

Now, let's look at the double mutants involving G2. The double mutants g1g2, g2g3, and g1g2 all have 0% resistance. Wait, no, the data says g2g3 is 0%, g1g2 is 0%, but g1g3 is 10%.

So when you have a g2 mutant, any double mutant with it (g2g3, g1g2) results in 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. Wait, what's epistasis? Oh, right, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If a mutation in G2 (g2) leads to maximum susceptibility, then perhaps G2 is upstream of the other genes. So G2's product is necessary for the function of G1 and G3.

Wait, no, maybe the other way around. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then it would regulate G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed or active. But in this case, the single mutants g1, g3 are still partially resistant.

Wait, but the single g2 mutant has 0% resistance. So without G2, they can't resist, which suggests G2 is necessary for the resistance pathway.

So, what about the double mutants where G2 is not involved? Let's look at g1g3: 10% resistance. Both g1 and g3 are single mutants that have some resistance (75% and 50%), but together they're even worse.

Hmm, so when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is way down to 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in parallel pathways, perhaps. Because knocking both out would have a more severe effect than each alone. That's additive or synergistic.

Wait, but G2 is a transcription factor. So maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. But the single mutants g1 and g3 are still active because they have G2's product. Oh, but wait, the single mutants are for G1, G2, or G3. So in g1, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is still functional, so maybe G3 is expressed. Similarly, in g3, G3 is knocked out, so G1 is expressed.

Wait, let's think about the function. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But in the single mutants where G1 is knocked out, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So what would happen in the single mutant g2? Without G2, both G1 and G3 are not active, so the plant has no resistance (which matches: g2 is 0%).

Now, looking at the double mutants: g1g2 would have both G1 and G2 knocked out. But since G2 is already knocked out, G1's status doesn't matter because G2 is upstream. So in g1g2, the plant can't activate G1 or G3, so 0% resistance. Similarly, in g2g3, same thing.

But what about the g1g3 double mutant? So, if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2 but perhaps in separate pathways, then when both are knocked out, the plant can't use either pathway, leading to very low resistance. So G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, perhaps.

So the data suggests that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that are both regulated by G2. So without G2, both are off. But in the single mutants, each knockout only affects one pathway.

So for the double mutants without G2, the effect is the same as the single G2 mutant. But for the double mutants that don't involve G2, like g1g3, the effect is worse than either of the single mutants. So the combined effect is more severe, which suggests that G1 and G3 normally contribute additively to the resistance.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic towards G1.

Wait, no, we thought G2 is a TF, so option A is probably wrong because it says G1 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic over G1.

Same promoter? Not sure. But G3 would be epistatic if G3 is downstream. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50% which is worse than g1's 75%. So maybe G3 is downstream of G1?

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10% which is worse than either. So if G1 and G3 are in parallel, then knocking both would be additive. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance through separate pathways. So their functions are additive.

In genetics, when two genes in parallel pathways are both knocked out, the phenotype is worse than each single knockout. So that suggests that they're in parallel.

So for epistasis, if a gene is epistatic, it's when the phenotype of another gene depends on it. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the pathway of G1 is downstream of G3's.

Wait, no. Epistatic is about the position in the pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then gene A is downstream. Because the product of gene B can't function if gene A isn't doing its thing. Or maybe I'm getting that backward.

Alternatively, in terms of phenotypes: If knocking out gene A leads to a more severe phenotype than knocking out gene B, but knocking out both doesn't change the phenotype from A (because A is more severe), then A is epistatic to B.

Wait, let's think about the double mutant g1g3 being 10% resistance. Both g1 and g3 are single mutants. So if G1 is responsible for 25% loss (75% resistance left) and G3 is 50% loss (50% resistance), then in the double, the resistance is 10%. So 10% is much lower than either. So perhaps the two genes contribute to separate pathways, and their combined loss leads to additive effects.

Wait, let me think about it numerically. Control is 100%.

g1: 75% → so 25% loss.

g3: 50% → 50% loss.

If they are in separate pathways, the combined effect would be 75% (g1) of 50% (g3) → 37.5%, but the data says 10%. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe they are in the same pathway. But that doesn't fit because the double mutant would be worse than either. So perhaps their effects are additive.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the total resistance is the sum of the contributions from G1 and G3. So:

g1 has 75% → so 25% from G1, and the rest (75%) from elsewhere.

g3 has 50% → 50% from G3, and 50% from elsewhere.

If the double mutant g1g3 has 10% → which is 10% from both G1 and G3, so perhaps they are additive. But I'm not sure if that's the right model.

Alternatively, the presence of each gene contributes a certain level of resistance. So, if you have both, you have higher resistance than each alone. But in this case, the double mutant has lower than each alone. So that suggests that each gene contributes a certain amount, and together they're worse. So perhaps their functions are redundant, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's map out the data in terms of epistatic relationships.

In the double mutants, when you have g2 involved, resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to any other gene. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes can't compensate. So G2 is acting upstream. So in the pathway, G2 is first, then G1 and G3.

So G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to no resistance.

In the single mutants:

g1 is 75% → so G2 is active, as well as G3. So perhaps G3 contributes 25% of the resistance, which is why without G1, the resistance is 75% (maybe because G3 is still active).

g3 is 50% → So without G3, but G1 is active, so G1 contributes 50% of the resistance.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if G2 is active, then G1 and G3 are both expressed. So in the wild type, both contribute. So in the single mutants, each contributes the remaining.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the total resistance is additive from G1 and G3. So wild type is 100% = G1 + G2 + G3. No, wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the resistance is determined by the sum of the contributions of G1 and G3. So G1 contributes 50% and G3 contributes 25%, for a total of 75%. But that may not fit the data.

Let me think again. The wild type is 100% resistance. Let's think about each gene's contribution.

g1 has 75% resistance. So it's missing G1. So perhaps G1 contributes 25% to resistance. So the other 75% comes from G2 or G3.

g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant has 50% resistance. So G3 contributes 50% of the resistance. But wait, that can't be because the wild type is 100% and the single g3 is 50% → so that implies G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, and the other 50% comes from elsewhere, perhaps G1 or G2.

Wait, but G2 is a transcription factor, so perhaps its role is to activate G1 and G3. So in the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are active.

So if G2 is knocked out (g2), then G1 and G3 are not active. So resistance is 0% because neither G1 nor G3 contribute anything.

In the single mutants:

g1 → G1 is inactive, but G2 is active, so G3 is active. So resistance is 50%. But wait, the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, maybe the data is that g1 is 75% of the control. So the wild type is 100%, g1 is 75% → so without G1, the resistance is 75%. So perhaps G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

Similarly, g3 is 50% → so G3 contributes 50% of the resistance. So the total resistance in the wild type is from G1 + G3 + any other factors. But I think other factors are present.

Wait, maybe the total resistance is 100% = G1 + G3. So in wild type, G1 (25%) and G3 (50%) → 75%? But that would be only 75%. So perhaps there's another factor, like G2 itself. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the resistance is contributed by G1 and G3, and G2 is the upstream activator. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

In g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are active. So if G3 contributes 75% (so g1 is 75%) and G2 doesn't contribute directly, only through G1 and G3.

Wait, but the data says g1 is 75% resistance. So if G2 is active, but G1 is not, then G3 is active and contributes 75%? Or perhaps each gene contributes a certain amount.

Alternatively, maybe the resistance is a combination where each gene contributes an OR function. So if either G1 or G3 is active, the plant has some resistance.

But in g1, G3 is active, so resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that might suggest that G3 is more important. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either. So that suggests that both contribute additively.

Wait, perhaps the resistance is the sum of the contributions of G1 and G3. So:

Wild type: G1 + G3 = 75% (from g1) + 50% (from g3) → no, that can't be because 75 +50 is 125, which is more than 100%. Maybe it's not additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the resistance level is the maximum of G1 and G3 contributions. So if G3 is higher, the resistance is higher. But in the double mutant, they're both knocked out, leading to 0% resistance. Wait, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10% which isn't 0. Hmm, that contradicts.

I think I'm getting stuck on the exact model. Maybe a better approach is to look at the options and see which one aligns with the data.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

But we thought G2 is the TF. So option A is wrong because it says G1 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean they might be co-regulated. But in the data, knocking out G1 leaves G3 functional, as the resistance is 75% (g1). So if they had the same promoter, knocking out G1 wouldn't affect G3, but that's not the case. So option B is unlikely.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean G1 and G3 have multiple functions, but I'm not sure. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1 is downstream of G3. So without G1, the effect of G3 wouldn't matter. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse, so perhaps they are in separate pathways.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy means that either gene can perform the function. So if you have both knocked out, the effect is worse. But I'm not sure about the epistatic part.

Wait, what's gene redundancy? It means that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So in a single mutant, you only lose one, but with both knocked out, the function is lost. So that would lead to the double mutant having a worse phenotype than either single.

In the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So the double is much worse than either. That fits with gene redundancy, because each provides some function, but together they're additive.

So in this model, G1 and G3 are redundant. So when both are knocked out, their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype.

But how about the epistatic part? The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 depends on G1. So if G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is irrelevant.

But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then without G1, G3's effect would be seen. But in g3, it's 50%, which is worse than g1's.

Wait, let me think. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G3's function is only evident when G1 is present. So in a g3 mutant (G3 knocked out), the phenotype is determined by G1. But g3 is 50% resistance, which is worse than the wild type (100%) and worse than g1 (75%). So that suggests that G3 is contributing to resistance when G1 is present, but when G3 is knocked out, G1's contribution is 50%, not 75%.

Hmm, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of G3 allows for higher resistance, but without G3, G1 is less effective.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is downstream of G3. So if G3 is knocked out, G1 can't function either. But that doesn't fit the data because in g1, G3 is present and functional, leading to 75% resistance.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try to think about the epistatic relationships.

In the double mutant g1g2: resistance is 0%. Since g2 is 0%, and g1g2 is also 0%, this suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when G2 is not working, the presence of G1 doesn't help. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, in g2g3: 0% → same reasoning.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the other double mutants. The only one is g1g3: 10%. Since both g1 and g3 have some resistance (75% and 50%), their combined knockout leads to 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 and G3 must be in separate pathways. So their functions are additive. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive (75% +50% = 125% of some value? Hmm, not sure).

So in terms of epistasis, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing some level of resistance. So the double mutant has both pathways knocked out, leading to much lower resistance.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that they can compensate for each other. So in the double mutant, they can't, leading to a worse phenotype. That fits the data (g1g3 is 10%). But does that fit with G1 being epistatic to G3? If G1 is epistatic, then the effect of G3 depends on G1. But in the double mutant, if G3 is knocked out, the presence of G1 doesn't matter. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because it says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which would mean that G1 is downstream. So in the absence of G1 (g1), the effect of G3 is seen, which is 75% for g1. Hmm, but g3 is 50% resistance, which is worse than g1.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. So in g3, the effect is seen regardless of G1. But in the double mutant, it's 10% which is worse than either. So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option says.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 have multiple effects. But I don't see how that fits with the data. The data doesn't suggest that G1 and G3 are involved in multiple traits beyond the observed resistance.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would explain why the double mutant is worse than either single. So knocking both out removes both redundant functions, leading to a more severe phenotype. So that fits.

As for epistasis, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the function of G3 depends on G1. So in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 is masked. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So that would suggest that G3's function is more critical than G1's. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Because in that case, without G3, G1 can't contribute.

Wait, I think I'm getting this backwards. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the effect of gene B is only seen when gene A is functional. So if gene A is knocked out, the effect of gene B's knockout is not observed.

In our case, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is lower than when G1 is knocked out. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G1's function is only visible when G3 is present.

But wait, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the absence of G3, G1's function is masked. But in reality, when G3 is knocked out, G1's function is still present (as in g3, G1 is functional but G3 is not). So the resistance is 50% in g3, which is lower than g1's 75%. So perhaps G3 is in a pathway upstream of G1. So without G3, G1 can't function, but that's not the case because in g1, G3 is active.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to outline the possible pathways.

Possibility 1: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So without G2, both are off. So g2 is 0%. In g1, G3 is active, so resistance is higher than g3, which has G1 active. So in this model, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through separate pathways.

In the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are knocked out, leading to very low resistance (10%).

So in this case, G1 and G3 are redundant in the sense that each provides some resistance, but they are additive. So their combined knockout leads to the sum of their effects.

But redundancy usually refers to genes that can compensate for each other, but in this case, their double knockout is worse than either single, which suggests they are additive, not redundant.

Hmm.

So looking at the options again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If that's the case, then their double knockout would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single, which is what we see (g1g3 is 10%). So redundancy fits.

And G2 is the TF, which is upstream.

So which option says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3?

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But if G1 is epistatic, that would mean that G3's function is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, g3 (G3 knockout) has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%. So if G3's function is only seen when G1 is present, then in g3, G1 is present but G3 isn't, so the resistance would be same as wild type without G3. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of the pathway. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1 is downstream. So the pathway would be G2 → G3 → G1. So without G3, G1 can't function. But in our data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is better than the double mutant g1g3 (10%). So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G3 is downstream. So G2 → G1 → G3. So without G1, G3 can't function. But that doesn't fit the data either because in g1, G3 is functional and the resistance is 75%.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the option where G2 is TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and G2 is epistatic to both. So when G2 is knocked out, all resistance is lost.

Looking at the options:

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is downstream. If G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout isn't seen. But in the data, g3 is worse than g1, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is downstream. Without G1, G3's effect isn't observed. But in g3, G1 is present, so G3's knockout reduces resistance to 50%, which is worse than the wild type. So perhaps G3 has a more significant role.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 masks the effect of G3. So when G1 is present, the effect of G3 is seen. When G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout doesn't matter. But in the data, g3 is 50% resistance, and g1 is 75%. So G3's knockout leads to a worse phenotype than G1's. So G3's function is more important than G1's. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1.

So if G3 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that G1's function is only seen when G3 is present. So in the absence of G3, G1's function is irrelevant. But in g1, G3 is present, so the resistance is 75% because G1 is knocked out. But in g3, G1 is present but G3 is knocked out, leading to 50% resistance. So this suggests that G3's function is more important. So G3 is epistatic to G1.

But none of the options directly state that. Let me look again.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is downstream.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So if G3 is epistatic to G1, none of the options state that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, so they're in parallel pathways. So G1 and G3 are redundant, providing additive resistance. So option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which fits.

And G2 is the TF. So the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant.

As for the epistatic part, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure. Since their double mutant is worse, perhaps neither is epistatic and they are in parallel.

Wait, the question is about which conclusion you can draw from the experiment. The epistatic relationship may not be deducible, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, the other genes don't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because G1 and G3 don't show pleiotropy; they're only involved in this resistance trait.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the epistatic part. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not entirely confident about the epistatic part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because, in the double mutant g1g3, they have 10% resistance. Since both are less than wild type, their functions are additive, so they're in separate pathways, and G2 is upstream. So G2 is epistatic to both.

So which option says G2 is TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (showing pleiotropy?), and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but in this case, G1 and G3 are each affecting the same trait through separate pathways. So pleiotropy doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, no, pleiotropy doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: think about which options are possible.

Option A: G1 is TF → no, because the question says at least one is TF, and I think it's G2.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have same promoter → that would mean G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But in the data, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%, so they aren't the same. So option B is wrong.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy → no, because they only affect one trait.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy → yes, because their double mutant is worse than either.

So option D fits the redundancy, but what about the epistatic part.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G3's function depends on G1. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out. So if G3 is only functional when G1 is present, then g3 would have the same resistance as wild type without G3. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main points are:

- G2 is the transcription factor (knockout leads to 0% resistance).

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (their double mutant is worse than either).

- So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So looking at the options, which option includes G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 as redundant or additive.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So perhaps that's correct.

So the answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The experiment investigates the interactions of three candidate genes (G1, G2, and G3) in white lupine plants contributing to resistance against anthracnose. The data shows resistance levels for single mutants and double mutants, with the control at 100% resistance. The key findings are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Analysis:
1. **Role of G2**:  
   - The single mutant **g2** has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.  
   - Double mutants involving **g2** (e.g., **g1g2**, **g2g3**) also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance.

2. **Interactions between G1 and G3**:  
   - The single mutants **g1** and **g3** show partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), indicating that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance.  
   - The double mutant **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways and their contributions are additive. When both are knocked out, resistance is significantly reduced.

3. **Gene Redundancy**:  
   - The additive effect of G1 and G3 in the double mutant **g1g3** (10% resistance) supports the idea of **gene redundancy**, where each gene provides partial resistance, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

4. **Epistasis**:  
   - The data does not strongly support G1 being epistatic to G3 or vice versa. However, the double mutant **g1g3** being worse than either single mutant aligns with the concept of redundancy rather than strict epistasis.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states G1 is the TF, but the data indicates G2 is the TF.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 have the same promoter, but their resistance contributions differ (75% for g1 and 50% for g3).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It mentions pleiotropy, which refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits, but G1 and G3 only affect resistance through separate pathways.  
- **Option D**: Correct. It states G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. The data supports gene redundancy (additive effects in g1g3) and aligns with G2 being the TF.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (showing gene redundancy), and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. 

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The experiment is about finding genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. The setup is that they have three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also double mutants.

The main thing I remember from genetics is that when you have mutants with varying levels of resistance, you can infer the relationships between the genes. The question mentions that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So transcription factors usually regulate other genes, right?

The data shows the resistance levels for each mutant and the double mutants. The control is 100% resistance, which is the wild type. Let's list the results:

- g1: 75% → So their resistance is reduced by 25% compared to wild type.
- g2: 0% → No resistance at all. So this plant is super susceptible.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance of the wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance.
- g2g3: 0% → Also no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → No resistance.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out the genetic relationships based on these results. Let's think about each double mutant.

First, for the double mutants. If you have two mutations and the resistance is worse than each individual, it might suggest that the genes are in the same pathway. Or perhaps they function additively.

Looking at g2: it's 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that is critical for resistance. Because without it, the plant can't resist the disease at all.

Now, let's look at the double mutants involving G2. The double mutants g1g2, g2g3, and g1g2 all have 0% resistance. Wait, no, the data says g2g3 is 0%, g1g2 is 0%, but g1g3 is 10%.

So when you have a g2 mutant, any double mutant with it (g2g3, g1g2) results in 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. Wait, what's epistasis? Oh, right, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If a mutation in G2 (g2) leads to maximum susceptibility, then perhaps G2 is upstream of the other genes. So G2's product is necessary for the function of G1 and G3.

Wait, no, maybe the other way around. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then it would regulate G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed or active. But in this case, the single mutants g1, g3 are still partially resistant.

Wait, but the single g2 mutant has 0% resistance. So without G2, they can't resist, which suggests G2 is necessary for the resistance pathway.

So, what about the double mutants where G2 is not involved? Let's look at g1g3: 10% resistance. Both g1 and g3 are single mutants that have some resistance (75% and 50%), but together they're even worse.

Hmm, so when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is way down to 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in parallel pathways, perhaps. Because knocking both out would have a more severe effect than each alone. That's additive or synergistic.

Wait, but G2 is a transcription factor. So maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. But the single mutants g1 and g3 are still active because they have G2's product. Oh, but wait, the single mutants are for G1, G2, or G3. So in g1, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is still functional, so maybe G3 is expressed. Similarly, in g3, G3 is knocked out, so G1 is expressed.

Wait, let's think about the function. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But in the single mutants where G1 is knocked out, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So what would happen in the single mutant g2? Without G2, both G1 and G3 are not active, so the plant has no resistance (which matches: g2 is 0%).

Now, looking at the double mutants: g1g2 would have both G1 and G2 knocked out. But since G2 is already knocked out, G1's status doesn't matter because G2 is upstream. So in g1g2, the plant can't activate G1 or G3, so 0% resistance. Similarly, in g2g3, same thing.

But what about the g1g3 double mutant? So, if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2 but perhaps in separate pathways, then when both are knocked out, the plant can't use either pathway, leading to very low resistance. So G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, perhaps.

So the data suggests that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that are both regulated by G2. So without G2, both are off. But in the single mutants, each knockout only affects one pathway.

So for the double mutants without G2, the effect is the same as the single G2 mutant. But for the double mutants that don't involve G2, like g1g3, the effect is worse than either of the single mutants. So the combined effect is more severe, which suggests that G1 and G3 normally contribute additively to the resistance.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic towards G1.

Wait, no, we thought G2 is a TF, so option A is probably wrong because it says G1 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic over G1.

Same promoter? Not sure. But G3 would be epistatic if G3 is downstream. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50% which is worse than g1's 75%. So maybe G3 is downstream of G1?

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10% which is worse than either. So if G1 and G3 are in parallel, then knocking both would be additive. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute to the resistance through separate pathways. So their functions are additive.

In genetics, when two genes in parallel pathways are both knocked out, the phenotype is worse than each single knockout. So that suggests that they're in parallel.

So for epistasis, if a gene is epistatic, it's when the phenotype of another gene depends on it. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the pathway of G1 is downstream of G3's.

Wait, no. Epistatic is about the position in the pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then gene A is downstream. Because the product of gene B can't function if gene A isn't doing its thing. Or maybe I'm getting that backward.

Alternatively, in terms of phenotypes: If knocking out gene A leads to a more severe phenotype than knocking out gene B, but knocking out both doesn't change the phenotype from A (because A is more severe), then A is epistatic to B.

Wait, let's think about the double mutant g1g3 being 10% resistance. Both g1 and g3 are single mutants. So if G1 is responsible for 25% loss (75% resistance left) and G3 is 50% loss (50% resistance), then in the double, the resistance is 10%. So 10% is much lower than either. So perhaps the two genes contribute to separate pathways, and their combined loss leads to additive effects.

Wait, let me think about it numerically. Control is 100%.

g1: 75% → so 25% loss.

g3: 50% → 50% loss.

If they are in separate pathways, the combined effect would be 75% (g1) of 50% (g3) → 37.5%, but the data says 10%. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe they are in the same pathway. But that doesn't fit because the double mutant would be worse than either. So perhaps their effects are additive.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the total resistance is the sum of the contributions from G1 and G3. So:

g1 has 75% → so 25% from G1, and the rest (75%) from elsewhere.

g3 has 50% → 50% from G3, and 50% from elsewhere.

If the double mutant g1g3 has 10% → which is 10% from both G1 and G3, so perhaps they are additive. But I'm not sure if that's the right model.

Alternatively, the presence of each gene contributes a certain level of resistance. So, if you have both, you have higher resistance than each alone. But in this case, the double mutant has lower than each alone. So that suggests that each gene contributes a certain amount, and together they're worse. So perhaps their functions are redundant, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's map out the data in terms of epistatic relationships.

In the double mutants, when you have g2 involved, resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to any other gene. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes can't compensate. So G2 is acting upstream. So in the pathway, G2 is first, then G1 and G3.

So G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to no resistance.

In the single mutants:

g1 is 75% → so G2 is active, as well as G3. So perhaps G3 contributes 25% of the resistance, which is why without G1, the resistance is 75% (maybe because G3 is still active).

g3 is 50% → So without G3, but G1 is active, so G1 contributes 50% of the resistance.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if G2 is active, then G1 and G3 are both expressed. So in the wild type, both contribute. So in the single mutants, each contributes the remaining.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the total resistance is additive from G1 and G3. So wild type is 100% = G1 + G2 + G3. No, wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the resistance is determined by the sum of the contributions of G1 and G3. So G1 contributes 50% and G3 contributes 25%, for a total of 75%. But that may not fit the data.

Let me think again. The wild type is 100% resistance. Let's think about each gene's contribution.

g1 has 75% resistance. So it's missing G1. So perhaps G1 contributes 25% to resistance. So the other 75% comes from G2 or G3.

g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant has 50% resistance. So G3 contributes 50% of the resistance. But wait, that can't be because the wild type is 100% and the single g3 is 50% → so that implies G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, and the other 50% comes from elsewhere, perhaps G1 or G2.

Wait, but G2 is a transcription factor, so perhaps its role is to activate G1 and G3. So in the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are active.

So if G2 is knocked out (g2), then G1 and G3 are not active. So resistance is 0% because neither G1 nor G3 contribute anything.

In the single mutants:

g1 → G1 is inactive, but G2 is active, so G3 is active. So resistance is 50%. But wait, the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, maybe the data is that g1 is 75% of the control. So the wild type is 100%, g1 is 75% → so without G1, the resistance is 75%. So perhaps G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

Similarly, g3 is 50% → so G3 contributes 50% of the resistance. So the total resistance in the wild type is from G1 + G3 + any other factors. But I think other factors are present.

Wait, maybe the total resistance is 100% = G1 + G3. So in wild type, G1 (25%) and G3 (50%) → 75%? But that would be only 75%. So perhaps there's another factor, like G2 itself. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the resistance is contributed by G1 and G3, and G2 is the upstream activator. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

In g1: G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are active. So if G3 contributes 75% (so g1 is 75%) and G2 doesn't contribute directly, only through G1 and G3.

Wait, but the data says g1 is 75% resistance. So if G2 is active, but G1 is not, then G3 is active and contributes 75%? Or perhaps each gene contributes a certain amount.

Alternatively, maybe the resistance is a combination where each gene contributes an OR function. So if either G1 or G3 is active, the plant has some resistance.

But in g1, G3 is active, so resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that might suggest that G3 is more important. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either. So that suggests that both contribute additively.

Wait, perhaps the resistance is the sum of the contributions of G1 and G3. So:

Wild type: G1 + G3 = 75% (from g1) + 50% (from g3) → no, that can't be because 75 +50 is 125, which is more than 100%. Maybe it's not additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the resistance level is the maximum of G1 and G3 contributions. So if G3 is higher, the resistance is higher. But in the double mutant, they're both knocked out, leading to 0% resistance. Wait, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10% which isn't 0. Hmm, that contradicts.

I think I'm getting stuck on the exact model. Maybe a better approach is to look at the options and see which one aligns with the data.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

But we thought G2 is the TF. So option A is wrong because it says G1 is TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean they might be co-regulated. But in the data, knocking out G1 leaves G3 functional, as the resistance is 75% (g1). So if they had the same promoter, knocking out G1 wouldn't affect G3, but that's not the case. So option B is unlikely.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean G1 and G3 have multiple functions, but I'm not sure. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1 is downstream of G3. So without G1, the effect of G3 wouldn't matter. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse, so perhaps they are in separate pathways.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy means that either gene can perform the function. So if you have both knocked out, the effect is worse. But I'm not sure about the epistatic part.

Wait, what's gene redundancy? It means that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So in a single mutant, you only lose one, but with both knocked out, the function is lost. So that would lead to the double mutant having a worse phenotype than either single.

In the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So the double is much worse than either. That fits with gene redundancy, because each provides some function, but together they're additive.

So in this model, G1 and G3 are redundant. So when both are knocked out, their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype.

But how about the epistatic part? The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 depends on G1. So if G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is irrelevant.

But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then without G1, G3's effect would be seen. But in g3, it's 50%, which is worse than g1's.

Wait, let me think. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G3's function is only evident when G1 is present. So in a g3 mutant (G3 knocked out), the phenotype is determined by G1. But g3 is 50% resistance, which is worse than the wild type (100%) and worse than g1 (75%). So that suggests that G3 is contributing to resistance when G1 is present, but when G3 is knocked out, G1's contribution is 50%, not 75%.

Hmm, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of G3 allows for higher resistance, but without G3, G1 is less effective.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is downstream of G3. So if G3 is knocked out, G1 can't function either. But that doesn't fit the data because in g1, G3 is present and functional, leading to 75% resistance.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try to think about the epistatic relationships.

In the double mutant g1g2: resistance is 0%. Since g2 is 0%, and g1g2 is also 0%, this suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when G2 is not working, the presence of G1 doesn't help. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, in g2g3: 0% → same reasoning.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the other double mutants. The only one is g1g3: 10%. Since both g1 and g3 have some resistance (75% and 50%), their combined knockout leads to 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 and G3 must be in separate pathways. So their functions are additive. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive (75% +50% = 125% of some value? Hmm, not sure).

So in terms of epistasis, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing some level of resistance. So the double mutant has both pathways knocked out, leading to much lower resistance.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that they can compensate for each other. So in the double mutant, they can't, leading to a worse phenotype. That fits the data (g1g3 is 10%). But does that fit with G1 being epistatic to G3? If G1 is epistatic, then the effect of G3 depends on G1. But in the double mutant, if G3 is knocked out, the presence of G1 doesn't matter. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because it says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which would mean that G1 is downstream. So in the absence of G1 (g1), the effect of G3 is seen, which is 75% for g1. Hmm, but g3 is 50% resistance, which is worse than g1.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. So in g3, the effect is seen regardless of G1. But in the double mutant, it's 10% which is worse than either. So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option says.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 have multiple effects. But I don't see how that fits with the data. The data doesn't suggest that G1 and G3 are involved in multiple traits beyond the observed resistance.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would explain why the double mutant is worse than either single. So knocking both out removes both redundant functions, leading to a more severe phenotype. So that fits.

As for epistasis, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the function of G3 depends on G1. So in the absence of G1, the effect of G3 is masked. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So that would suggest that G3's function is more critical than G1's. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Because in that case, without G3, G1 can't contribute.

Wait, I think I'm getting this backwards. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the effect of gene B is only seen when gene A is functional. So if gene A is knocked out, the effect of gene B's knockout is not observed.

In our case, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is lower than when G1 is knocked out. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G1's function is only visible when G3 is present.

But wait, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the absence of G3, G1's function is masked. But in reality, when G3 is knocked out, G1's function is still present (as in g3, G1 is functional but G3 is not). So the resistance is 50% in g3, which is lower than g1's 75%. So perhaps G3 is in a pathway upstream of G1. So without G3, G1 can't function, but that's not the case because in g1, G3 is active.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to outline the possible pathways.

Possibility 1: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So without G2, both are off. So g2 is 0%. In g1, G3 is active, so resistance is higher than g3, which has G1 active. So in this model, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through separate pathways.

In the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are knocked out, leading to very low resistance (10%).

So in this case, G1 and G3 are redundant in the sense that each provides some resistance, but they are additive. So their combined knockout leads to the sum of their effects.

But redundancy usually refers to genes that can compensate for each other, but in this case, their double knockout is worse than either single, which suggests they are additive, not redundant.

Hmm.

So looking at the options again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If that's the case, then their double knockout would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single, which is what we see (g1g3 is 10%). So redundancy fits.

And G2 is the TF, which is upstream.

So which option says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3?

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But if G1 is epistatic, that would mean that G3's function is only seen when G1 is present. But in the data, g3 (G3 knockout) has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%. So if G3's function is only seen when G1 is present, then in g3, G1 is present but G3 isn't, so the resistance would be same as wild type without G3. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of the pathway. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1 is downstream. So the pathway would be G2 → G3 → G1. So without G3, G1 can't function. But in our data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is better than the double mutant g1g3 (10%). So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G3 is downstream. So G2 → G1 → G3. So without G1, G3 can't function. But that doesn't fit the data either because in g1, G3 is functional and the resistance is 75%.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the option where G2 is TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and G2 is epistatic to both. So when G2 is knocked out, all resistance is lost.

Looking at the options:

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is downstream. If G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout isn't seen. But in the data, g3 is worse than g1, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is downstream. Without G1, G3's effect isn't observed. But in g3, G1 is present, so G3's knockout reduces resistance to 50%, which is worse than the wild type. So perhaps G3 has a more significant role.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 masks the effect of G3. So when G1 is present, the effect of G3 is seen. When G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout doesn't matter. But in the data, g3 is 50% resistance, and g1 is 75%. So G3's knockout leads to a worse phenotype than G1's. So G3's function is more important than G1's. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1.

So if G3 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that G1's function is only seen when G3 is present. So in the absence of G3, G1's function is irrelevant. But in g1, G3 is present, so the resistance is 75% because G1 is knocked out. But in g3, G1 is present but G3 is knocked out, leading to 50% resistance. So this suggests that G3's function is more important. So G3 is epistatic to G1.

But none of the options directly state that. Let me look again.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is downstream.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So if G3 is epistatic to G1, none of the options state that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, so they're in parallel pathways. So G1 and G3 are redundant, providing additive resistance. So option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which fits.

And G2 is the TF. So the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant.

As for the epistatic part, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure. Since their double mutant is worse, perhaps neither is epistatic and they are in parallel.

Wait, the question is about which conclusion you can draw from the experiment. The epistatic relationship may not be deducible, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, the other genes don't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, because G1 and G3 don't show pleiotropy; they're only involved in this resistance trait.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the epistatic part. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not entirely confident about the epistatic part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because, in the double mutant g1g3, they have 10% resistance. Since both are less than wild type, their functions are additive, so they're in separate pathways, and G2 is upstream. So G2 is epistatic to both.

So which option says G2 is TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (showing pleiotropy?), and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but in this case, G1 and G3 are each affecting the same trait through separate pathways. So pleiotropy doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct option is D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, no, pleiotropy doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: think about which options are possible.

Option A: G1 is TF → no, because the question says at least one is TF, and I think it's G2.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have same promoter → that would mean G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But in the data, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%, so they aren't the same. So option B is wrong.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy → no, because they only affect one trait.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy → yes, because their double mutant is worse than either.

So option D fits the redundancy, but what about the epistatic part.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G3's function depends on G1. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out. So if G3 is only functional when G1 is present, then g3 would have the same resistance as wild type without G3. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main points are:

- G2 is the transcription factor (knockout leads to 0% resistance).

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (their double mutant is worse than either).

- So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So looking at the options, which option includes G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 as redundant or additive.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So perhaps that's correct.

So the answer would be option D.


The experiment investigates the interactions of three candidate genes (G1, G2, and G3) in white lupine plants contributing to resistance against anthracnose. The data shows resistance levels for single mutants and double mutants, with the control at 100% resistance. The key findings are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Analysis:
1. **Role of G2**:  
   - The single mutant **g2** has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.  
   - Double mutants involving **g2** (e.g., **g1g2**, **g2g3**) also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance.

2. **Interactions between G1 and G3**:  
   - The single mutants **g1** and **g3** show partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), indicating that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance.  
   - The double mutant **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways and their contributions are additive. When both are knocked out, resistance is significantly reduced.

3. **Gene Redundancy**:  
   - The additive effect of G1 and G3 in the double mutant **g1g3** (10% resistance) supports the idea of **gene redundancy**, where each gene provides partial resistance, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

4. **Epistasis**:  
   - The data does not strongly support G1 being epistatic to G3 or vice versa. However, the double mutant **g1g3** being worse than either single mutant aligns with the concept of redundancy rather than strict epistasis.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states G1 is the TF, but the data indicates G2 is the TF.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 have the same promoter, but their resistance contributions differ (75% for g1 and 50% for g3).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It mentions pleiotropy, which refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits, but G1 and G3 only affect resistance through separate pathways.  
- **Option D**: Correct. It states G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. The data supports gene redundancy (additive effects in g1g3) and aligns with G2 being the TF.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (showing gene redundancy), and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.
