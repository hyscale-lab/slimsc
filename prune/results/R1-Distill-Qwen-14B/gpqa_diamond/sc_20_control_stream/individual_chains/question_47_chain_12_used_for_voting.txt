Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying a compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2. They've given IR and 1H NMR data, and four options to choose from. I need to figure out which one matches the data.

First, I'll start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2: that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DOU). DOU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is three DOU), a double bond, and maybe an ester or amide group, which have double bonds as well.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Amide or amine groups would show up around there. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Esters and amides typically have carbonyls around 1700-1750 cm-1. So maybe an ester or amide is present.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. A triplet for 3H usually suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2. Like an ethyl group's CH3. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH2 group, but wait, the IR had two N-H stretches. Wait, but if it's a broad singlet of 2H, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or perhaps an NH group. Hmm, but if it's an amine, the NH would be a broad peak, but 2H? Oh wait, maybe it's an NH adjacent to an oxygen. Or perhaps this is an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet for 2H. So probably a CH2 next to a CH2 group. If the 1.20 is a CH3, then the quartet is likely the adjacent CH2. Like in an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet (coupled with the CH2) and the CH2 as quartet. Wait, but wait—the 1.20 is triplet, which is usually a CH3 next to a CH2. So that would fit an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3. But then where's the quartet? Oh, maybe the quartet is another CH2 group elsewhere.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like if there's a substituent on the benzene, and the coupling is between the ortho protons. Wait, but in para substitution, the protons are typically two doublets, each integrating to 2H, and they're coupled with their adjacent protons. So maybe the benzene has two substituents on the para positions, or one substituent with two ortho protons. Wait, no, if it's a para-substituted benzene, like -X in para, then the aromatic protons would be a doublet of doublets or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, leading to two doublets each of 2H. For example, if the substituent is such that only two sets of equivalent protons are present.

Putting that together, maybe the benzene ring has two substituents on para positions, or maybe the substituent itself is a group that causes the protons to split into two doublets.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So benzamide has a CONH2 group, with the ethoxy at meta. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 4, but I'm not sure how that would split. Alternatively, perhaps the benzamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at 3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the substituents. If the benzamide is at position 1 (para to another group?), but in option A, it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, so the CONH2 is at position 1, with OCH2CH3 at position 3. Then the benzene would have substituents at 1 and 3. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,4,5,6. But in that case, the NMR would show more peaks. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is formamide (HCONH-), attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the benzene has an ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But in that case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (ortho to substituents), and 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta). So the NMR would show two doublets: maybe around 7.0 and 8.0, each as doublets. That fits with the given NMR data.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is propionoic acid attached to a benzene ring with an amine group at position 4. Wait, but propionate is CH2CH2COO-... Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO–. But 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO– attached to benzene, with an NH2 group at position 4. The NMR would show the NH2 as a broad peak, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H, which doesn't fit NH2. Also, the carbonyl would be from the carboxylic acid, but in this case, if it's a propionate, maybe it's an ester. Wait, or perhaps it's a carboxylic acid derivative. Hmm, but the IR shows a strong band at 1720, which is more indicative of an ester or amide than a carboxylic acid (which is usually broader and around 1700 but with a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300). Wait, but the IR also has peaks at 3420 and 3325, which could be N-H or O-H. If it's a carboxylic acid, we'd expect a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, but the given IR has two peaks which are possibly N-H. So maybe it's not a carboxylic acid but an amide or ester.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So that's a benzoate ester with an ethyl group and an amino group at position 4. Structure would be OEt and NH2 on the benzene ring, para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to OEt and NH2), and positions 3 and 5 (meta). Wait, but in this case, the substituents are in para positions. So the ring would have OEt and NH2 in para. The aromatic protons would be in two doublets. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 would be deshielded and perhaps show up at higher ppm. Maybe around 8.0 ppm, and the others at 7.0. So that matches the NMR data given.

Now, let's cross-reference with the NMR data.

Looking at the NMR:

The triplet at 1.20 (3H) suggests an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is likely the adjacent CH2 in the ethyl group, such as OCH2CH3. But wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet (coupled with the CH3 triplet). So the quartet would be at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But here the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an amide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group next to an oxygen.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a bit tricky. Broad singlet, 2H. Could this be an NH2 group? But the integration is 2H, so maybe it's an NH that's split. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group adjacent to another substituent. Or maybe it's an NCH2 group. Hmm.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at position 3. The ethoxy would be OCH2CH3, giving a triplet at 1.20 (3H) and quartet at 4.0-4.3 ppm for the OCH2. Wait, but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. So maybe that doesn't fit. Also, the NH2 would show up as a broad peak, but the given data has a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H, which doesn't immediately fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH– attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl. The ethoxy would give the triplet and quartet as before. The formamide has a NH group, which is broad. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Not sure. Also, the formamide's carbonyl is around 1700, which matches the IR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If it's a propionate ester, then the structure would be CH2CH2COOEt attached to a benzene with NH2 at para. The ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet as in the NMR. The NH2 would show a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which doesn't fit NH2. Also, the molecular formula for this would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: the benzene has C6H5, then the substituent is OCOEt (which is O, C2H5O), and NH2. Wait, no—wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H4NH2 connected to CH2CH2COOEt. So the formula would be C6H4NH2 (C7H7N) plus propionate (C3H5O2). So total C10H12NO2? Hmm, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So maybe I miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is connected differently.

Wait, maybe it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, meaning the structure is O=C(O-)CH2CH2-O- attached to the benzene, with NH2 in position 4. No, that's not correct. Propionate is CH2CH2COO–. So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 2 (from OEt) + 3 (from propionate) = C11? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's compute the formula.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester: the benzene ring has a COOEt group and an NH2 group para to each other. So the formula would be C8H7NO2 (benzoate: C7H5O2, ethyl adds 2 C and 5 H, but wait, wait: COOEt is O2, and the ethyl is C2H5, but the formula of benzoate is C7H5O2. Adding ethyl would make it C9H10O2? Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester would be C9H10O2. But in option D, it's 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester: so the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because adding NH2 (which is -NH2, adding 1N, 2H, and one more H from the benzoate). Let me check: Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you make the ester, you replace the -OH with OEt, so you add C2H5, so the ester becomes C9H10O2. Then, adding an NH2 group (since it's 4-aminobenzoate), the formula becomes C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So option D's formula matches.

Now, looking back at the NMR data for option D. The ethyl ester group would give the triplet and quartet. The 1.20 (t,3H) is the ethyl CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is the OCH2 in the ester. Then, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a bit confusing. If the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the NH2 would be on the benzene. The NH2 would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the peak at 4.0 is 2H, broad. So perhaps this is not NH2 because NH2 is usually a broad peak but as a singlet (unless in certain cases). Alternatively, maybe this is an N-attached group. Wait, in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring, so the NMR would show a peak for the NH2 protons. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which doesn't fit NH2. NH2 protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, but as a broad singlet, not as a doublet or another split. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is the amino group. But amino groups usually are broad, but integrating to 2H would imply two protons. So maybe it's an NH2 group. But then why is it a singlet? Unless it's exchanging and not split. But the data says 'bs' which is a broad singlet. So perhaps that's the NH2.

Wait, but in the NMR description, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. If it's NH2, then that would make sense. But in the given data, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet of 2H, which is likely the OCH2 from the ester.

Wait, another angle: looking at the aromatic protons. For option D, the 4-aminobenzoate ester would have the substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). Wait, no, the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group at position 4 relative to the COOEt. So the substituents are para to each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the COOEt group and meta to the NH2. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2. Depending on the substituents' electron-withdrawing or donating effects, the protons' chemical shifts would differ. But in the NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 7.0 (2H) and another at 8.0 (2H). That fits with a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

So, in option D, the COOEt group is at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2, which are deshielded, so higher ppm. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2, which are perhaps less deshielded. So, in the NMR, the higher ppm (8.0) would be the protons next to the COOEt, and the lower (7.0) would be next to NH2.

But wait, the amino group is electron-donating, which would shield the adjacent protons, making them appear downfield less. Whereas the ester group is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent protons, making them appear upfield? Or wait, I might have that reversed. Electron-withdrawing groups de-shield aromatic protons, causing them to appear downfield (higher ppm). So the protons ortho to the ester group would be more deshielded (higher ppm, around 8.0), and the protons ortho to the NH2 (which is electron-donating) would be less deshielded, appearing around 7.0. That matches the NMR data.

So putting this together: the triplet at 1.20 is the ethyl CH3, quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2, the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which as a broad singlet (maybe because it's exchanging), and the aromatic protons as two doublets.

But wait, in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm for 2H. That's a bit higher than the typical OCH2 in an ethyl ester. Normally, OCH2 in ethyl esters is around 4.1-4.3. So why is it at 4.5 here? Could this be due to the substituents on the benzene ring affecting the electronic environment, causing a downfield shift?

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is not from the ester but from another group. Let's think about the other options.

Looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONHR attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl. The ethoxy would give the triplet and quartet. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. Wait, formamide's NH is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR data, it's a singlet of 2H at 4.0 ppm. That doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 is from something else, like an OCH2 group. But in option B, the OCH2 is from the ethoxy group, which would be a quartet around 4.2-4.3. So that might not fit.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The propionate would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a triplet for a CH2CH2 group. The given NMR has a triplet at 1.20 (3H), which would fit a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with an ester (C=O stretch around 1720-1740) or an amide (which is lower, around 1640-1700). But the IR also has N-H stretches, which suggests amide or amine. So the compound is likely an amide or an ester with an amine group.

Wait, but in option D, it's an ester (the benzoate) and an amine group (NH2), so the IR would show both the ester carbonyl and the N-H stretches. That fits.

So putting it all together, option D seems to fit the NMR data. The triplet at 1.20 is the ethyl CH3, quartet at 4.5 is OCH2. The broad singlet at 4.0 is NH2. The aromatic protons split into two doublets, consistent with a para-substituted benzene with an ester and an amine group.

Wait, but what about option B? N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Its structure would have formamide as HCONH– attached to the benzene, with an OCH2CH3 group at para. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak. The ethoxy would give triplet and quartet. Then, the aromatic protons would be ortho and para, but perhaps giving two doublets as well. But in this case, the 4.0 ppm peak would be from the NH group, which is perhaps split into a singlet. But I'm not sure; I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from the formamide's NH adjacent to something, but that doesn't make much sense.

Another point: the molecular formula for option D is correct (C9H11NO2), while for option B, let's compute it. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: the benzene is C6H5, with OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), and the formamide group is HCONH–. So the formula would be C6 + 2 (from ethoxy) + 2 (from formamide: HCONH– has C2H3NO). So C6 +2 +2= C10? Wait, no, the benzene is C6H5, so when you add OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), and the formamide is HCONH– (which is C2H3NO), the total would be C6 + C2 + C2 = C10? Let me compute:

Formamide: HCONH- → C2H3NO.
4-ethoxyphenyl: C6H4OCH2CH3 → C8H9O.
So total is C2 + C8 = C10. H: 3 (from formamide) +9 (from ethoxyphenyl) =12 H. N:1, O: 1 (from formamide) +1 (ethoxy) = 2. So formula would be C10H12NO2? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option B doesn't fit the molecular formula. Therefore, option B is out.

Similarly, option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let's compute the formula. 4-aminophenyl is C6H5NH2 → C6H7N. Propionate is CH2CH2COO–. So the ester would be CH2CH2COOEt (assuming it's an ethyl propionate?), but wait, the structure is OCOCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, but with an NH2 group. So the formula would be:

Benzene (C6H5) + NH2 (adds 1N and 2H) + OCOCH2CH2CH3 (C4H7O2). So total C: 6 +4=10. H:5 (from C6H5) +2 (NH2) +7 (OCOCH2CH2CH3) → 14 H. O: 2 from ester. N:1. So formula is C10H14NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option C is out.

So, the remaining options are A and D. We've already considered that option D's formula matches.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with OCH2CH3 at position 3. The formula would be C9H10O2N (since benzamide is C7H5NO2, plus ethoxy adds C2H5O, so total C9H10NO2). Wait, that's C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A has one less H. So perhaps option A is out due to the formula mismatch.

Wait, let me compute again. Benzamide is C7H5NO2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2; replacing COOH with CONH2 would give C7H5NO2). Then, adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) adds 2C, 5H, 1O. So total would be C7 +2= C9, H5 +5= H10, O2 +1=3? No, wait, benzamide is C7H5NO2 (so O2), adding OCH2CH3 adds another O, making O3. So the formula would be C9H10NO3, which doesn't match the given formula (C9H11NO2). So option A is out.

Therefore, the only option that fits the molecular formula is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about the NMR peaks. Let me double-check.

In option D, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at para position.

So the NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → CH3 of ethyl ester.
4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → OCH2CH3. The quartet here makes sense because the OCH2 is adjacent to CH3, giving four peaks (quartet).
4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → NH2. But wait, NH2 is usually a broad peak, but integrating to 2H. Wait, but in this structure, the NH2 is on the benzene, so it's a secondary amine group. Wait, no, it's an aniline group, which is a primary amine. The NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear as a singlet. So the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be the NH2 protons. But wait, in aromatic amines, the NH2 is usually broad and can appear in the range of 3-5 ppm. So 4.0 is plausible.

The aromatic protons split into two doublets: one at 7.0 (2H) and another at 8.0 (2H). As discussed earlier, this fits the para substitution.

So all the NMR data aligns with option D. The IR shows N-H (amide or amine) and the ester carbonyl, which fits.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying a compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2. They've given IR and 1H NMR data, and four options to choose from. I need to figure out which one matches the data.

First, I'll start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2: that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DOU). DOU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is three DOU), a double bond, and maybe an ester or amide group, which have double bonds as well.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Amide or amine groups would show up around there. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Esters and amides typically have carbonyls around 1700-1750 cm-1. So maybe an ester or amide is present.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. A triplet for 3H usually suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2. Like an ethyl group's CH3. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH2 group, but wait, the IR had two N-H stretches. Wait, but if it's a broad singlet of 2H, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or perhaps an NH group. Hmm, but if it's an amine, the NH would be a broad peak, but 2H? Oh wait, maybe it's an NH adjacent to an oxygen. Or perhaps this is an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet for 2H. So probably a CH2 next to a CH2 group. If the 1.20 is a CH3, then the quartet is likely the adjacent CH2. Like in an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as triplet (coupled with the CH2) and the CH2 as quartet. Wait, but wait—the 1.20 is triplet, which is usually a CH3 next to a CH2. So that would fit an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3. But then where's the quartet? Oh, maybe the quartet is another CH2 group elsewhere.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like if there's a substituent on the benzene, and the coupling is between the ortho protons. Wait, but in para substitution, the protons are typically two doublets, each integrating to 2H, and they're coupled with their adjacent protons. So maybe the benzene has two substituents on the para positions, or one substituent with two ortho protons. Wait, no, if it's a para-substituted benzene, like -X in para, then the aromatic protons would be a doublet of doublets or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, leading to two doublets each of 2H. For example, if the substituent is such that only two sets of equivalent protons are present.

Putting that together, maybe the benzene ring has two substituents on para positions, or maybe the substituent itself is a group that causes the protons to split into two doublets.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So benzamide has a CONH2 group, with the ethoxy at meta. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 4, but I'm not sure how that would split. Alternatively, perhaps the benzamide is at position 1, and ethoxy at 3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the substituents. If the benzamide is at position 1 (para to another group?), but in option A, it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, so the CONH2 is at position 1, with OCH2CH3 at position 3. Then the benzene would have substituents at 1 and 3. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,4,5,6. But in that case, the NMR would show more peaks. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is formamide (HCONH-), attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the benzene has an ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group at position 1. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But in that case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (ortho to substituents), and 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta). So the NMR would show two doublets: maybe around 7.0 and 8.0, each as doublets. That fits with the given NMR data.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is propionoic acid attached to a benzene ring with an amine group at position 4. Wait, but propionate is CH2CH2COO-... Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO–. But 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO– attached to benzene, with an NH2 group at position 4. The NMR would show the NH2 as a broad peak, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H, which doesn't fit NH2. Also, the carbonyl would be from the carboxylic acid, but in this case, if it's a propionate, maybe it's an ester. Wait, or perhaps it's a carboxylic acid derivative. Hmm, but the IR shows a strong band at 1720, which is more indicative of an ester or amide than a carboxylic acid (which is usually broader and around 1700 but with a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300). Wait, but the IR also has peaks at 3420 and 3325, which could be N-H or O-H. If it's a carboxylic acid, we'd expect a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, but the given IR has two peaks which are possibly N-H. So maybe it's not a carboxylic acid but an amide or ester.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So that's a benzoate ester with an ethyl group and an amino group at position 4. Structure would be OEt and NH2 on the benzene ring, para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (ortho to OEt and NH2), and positions 3 and 5 (meta). Wait, but in this case, the substituents are in para positions. So the ring would have OEt and NH2 in para. The aromatic protons would be in two doublets. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 would be deshielded and perhaps show up at higher ppm. Maybe around 8.0 ppm, and the others at 7.0. So that matches the NMR data given.

Now, let's cross-reference with the NMR data.

Looking at the NMR:

The triplet at 1.20 (3H) suggests an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is likely the adjacent CH2 in the ethyl group, such as OCH2CH3. But wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet (coupled with the CH3 triplet). So the quartet would be at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But here the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an amide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group next to an oxygen.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a bit tricky. Broad singlet, 2H. Could this be an NH2 group? But the integration is 2H, so maybe it's an NH that's split. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group adjacent to another substituent. Or maybe it's an NCH2 group. Hmm.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at position 3. The ethoxy would be OCH2CH3, giving a triplet at 1.20 (3H) and quartet at 4.0-4.3 ppm for the OCH2. Wait, but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. So maybe that doesn't fit. Also, the NH2 would show up as a broad peak, but the given data has a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H, which doesn't immediately fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH– attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl. The ethoxy would give the triplet and quartet as before. The formamide has a NH group, which is broad. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Not sure. Also, the formamide's carbonyl is around 1700, which matches the IR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If it's a propionate ester, then the structure would be CH2CH2COOEt attached to a benzene with NH2 at para. The ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet as in the NMR. The NH2 would show a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which doesn't fit NH2. Also, the molecular formula for this would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: the benzene has C6H5, then the substituent is OCOEt (which is O, C2H5O), and NH2. Wait, no—wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H4NH2 connected to CH2CH2COOEt. So the formula would be C6H4NH2 (C7H7N) plus propionate (C3H5O2). So total C10H12NO2? Hmm, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So maybe I miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is connected differently.

Wait, maybe it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, meaning the structure is O=C(O-)CH2CH2-O- attached to the benzene, with NH2 in position 4. No, that's not correct. Propionate is CH2CH2COO–. So the formula would be C6 (benzene) + 2 (from OEt) + 3 (from propionate) = C11? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's compute the formula.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester: the benzene ring has a COOEt group and an NH2 group para to each other. So the formula would be C8H7NO2 (benzoate: C7H5O2, ethyl adds 2 C and 5 H, but wait, wait: COOEt is O2, and the ethyl is C2H5, but the formula of benzoate is C7H5O2. Adding ethyl would make it C9H10O2? Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester would be C9H10O2. But in option D, it's 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester: so the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because adding NH2 (which is -NH2, adding 1N, 2H, and one more H from the benzoate). Let me check: Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you make the ester, you replace the -OH with OEt, so you add C2H5, so the ester becomes C9H10O2. Then, adding an NH2 group (since it's 4-aminobenzoate), the formula becomes C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So option D's formula matches.

Now, looking back at the NMR data for option D. The ethyl ester group would give the triplet and quartet. The 1.20 (t,3H) is the ethyl CH3. The quartet at 4.5 (2H) is the OCH2 in the ester. Then, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a bit confusing. If the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the NH2 would be on the benzene. The NH2 would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the peak at 4.0 is 2H, broad. So perhaps this is not NH2 because NH2 is usually a broad peak but as a singlet (unless in certain cases). Alternatively, maybe this is an N-attached group. Wait, in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring, so the NMR would show a peak for the NH2 protons. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, which doesn't fit NH2. NH2 protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, but as a broad singlet, not as a doublet or another split. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is the amino group. But amino groups usually are broad, but integrating to 2H would imply two protons. So maybe it's an NH2 group. But then why is it a singlet? Unless it's exchanging and not split. But the data says 'bs' which is a broad singlet. So perhaps that's the NH2.

Wait, but in the NMR description, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. If it's NH2, then that would make sense. But in the given data, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet of 2H, which is likely the OCH2 from the ester.

Wait, another angle: looking at the aromatic protons. For option D, the 4-aminobenzoate ester would have the substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). Wait, no, the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group at position 4 relative to the COOEt. So the substituents are para to each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the COOEt group and meta to the NH2. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2. Depending on the substituents' electron-withdrawing or donating effects, the protons' chemical shifts would differ. But in the NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 7.0 (2H) and another at 8.0 (2H). That fits with a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

So, in option D, the COOEt group is at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2, which are deshielded, so higher ppm. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2, which are perhaps less deshielded. So, in the NMR, the higher ppm (8.0) would be the protons next to the COOEt, and the lower (7.0) would be next to NH2.

But wait, the amino group is electron-donating, which would shield the adjacent protons, making them appear downfield less. Whereas the ester group is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent protons, making them appear upfield? Or wait, I might have that reversed. Electron-withdrawing groups de-shield aromatic protons, causing them to appear downfield (higher ppm). So the protons ortho to the ester group would be more deshielded (higher ppm, around 8.0), and the protons ortho to the NH2 (which is electron-donating) would be less deshielded, appearing around 7.0. That matches the NMR data.

So putting this together: the triplet at 1.20 is the ethyl CH3, quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2, the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which as a broad singlet (maybe because it's exchanging), and the aromatic protons as two doublets.

But wait, in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm for 2H. That's a bit higher than the typical OCH2 in an ethyl ester. Normally, OCH2 in ethyl esters is around 4.1-4.3. So why is it at 4.5 here? Could this be due to the substituents on the benzene ring affecting the electronic environment, causing a downfield shift?

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is not from the ester but from another group. Let's think about the other options.

Looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONHR attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl. The ethoxy would give the triplet and quartet. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet of 2H. Wait, formamide's NH is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR data, it's a singlet of 2H at 4.0 ppm. That doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet at 4.0 is from something else, like an OCH2 group. But in option B, the OCH2 is from the ethoxy group, which would be a quartet around 4.2-4.3. So that might not fit.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The propionate would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a triplet for a CH2CH2 group. The given NMR has a triplet at 1.20 (3H), which would fit a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with an ester (C=O stretch around 1720-1740) or an amide (which is lower, around 1640-1700). But the IR also has N-H stretches, which suggests amide or amine. So the compound is likely an amide or an ester with an amine group.

Wait, but in option D, it's an ester (the benzoate) and an amine group (NH2), so the IR would show both the ester carbonyl and the N-H stretches. That fits.

So putting it all together, option D seems to fit the NMR data. The triplet at 1.20 is the ethyl CH3, quartet at 4.5 is OCH2. The broad singlet at 4.0 is NH2. The aromatic protons split into two doublets, consistent with a para-substituted benzene with an ester and an amine group.

Wait, but what about option B? N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Its structure would have formamide as HCONH– attached to the benzene, with an OCH2CH3 group at para. The formamide's NH would be a broad peak. The ethoxy would give triplet and quartet. Then, the aromatic protons would be ortho and para, but perhaps giving two doublets as well. But in this case, the 4.0 ppm peak would be from the NH group, which is perhaps split into a singlet. But I'm not sure; I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from the formamide's NH adjacent to something, but that doesn't make much sense.

Another point: the molecular formula for option D is correct (C9H11NO2), while for option B, let's compute it. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: the benzene is C6H5, with OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), and the formamide group is HCONH–. So the formula would be C6 + 2 (from ethoxy) + 2 (from formamide: HCONH– has C2H3NO). So C6 +2 +2= C10? Wait, no, the benzene is C6H5, so when you add OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), and the formamide is HCONH– (which is C2H3NO), the total would be C6 + C2 + C2 = C10? Let me compute:

Formamide: HCONH- → C2H3NO.
4-ethoxyphenyl: C6H4OCH2CH3 → C8H9O.
So total is C2 + C8 = C10. H: 3 (from formamide) +9 (from ethoxyphenyl) =12 H. N:1, O: 1 (from formamide) +1 (ethoxy) = 2. So formula would be C10H12NO2? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option B doesn't fit the molecular formula. Therefore, option B is out.

Similarly, option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let's compute the formula. 4-aminophenyl is C6H5NH2 → C6H7N. Propionate is CH2CH2COO–. So the ester would be CH2CH2COOEt (assuming it's an ethyl propionate?), but wait, the structure is OCOCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, but with an NH2 group. So the formula would be:

Benzene (C6H5) + NH2 (adds 1N and 2H) + OCOCH2CH2CH3 (C4H7O2). So total C: 6 +4=10. H:5 (from C6H5) +2 (NH2) +7 (OCOCH2CH2CH3) → 14 H. O: 2 from ester. N:1. So formula is C10H14NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option C is out.

So, the remaining options are A and D. We've already considered that option D's formula matches.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with OCH2CH3 at position 3. The formula would be C9H10O2N (since benzamide is C7H5NO2, plus ethoxy adds C2H5O, so total C9H10NO2). Wait, that's C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A has one less H. So perhaps option A is out due to the formula mismatch.

Wait, let me compute again. Benzamide is C7H5NO2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2; replacing COOH with CONH2 would give C7H5NO2). Then, adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) adds 2C, 5H, 1O. So total would be C7 +2= C9, H5 +5= H10, O2 +1=3? No, wait, benzamide is C7H5NO2 (so O2), adding OCH2CH3 adds another O, making O3. So the formula would be C9H10NO3, which doesn't match the given formula (C9H11NO2). So option A is out.

Therefore, the only option that fits the molecular formula is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about the NMR peaks. Let me double-check.

In option D, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at para position.

So the NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → CH3 of ethyl ester.
4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → OCH2CH3. The quartet here makes sense because the OCH2 is adjacent to CH3, giving four peaks (quartet).
4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → NH2. But wait, NH2 is usually a broad peak, but integrating to 2H. Wait, but in this structure, the NH2 is on the benzene, so it's a secondary amine group. Wait, no, it's an aniline group, which is a primary amine. The NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear as a singlet. So the 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be the NH2 protons. But wait, in aromatic amines, the NH2 is usually broad and can appear in the range of 3-5 ppm. So 4.0 is plausible.

The aromatic protons split into two doublets: one at 7.0 (2H) and another at 8.0 (2H). As discussed earlier, this fits the para substitution.

So all the NMR data aligns with option D. The IR shows N-H (amide or amine) and the ester carbonyl, which fits.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, with given IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group. The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, consistent with N-H stretches (amide or amine), and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group (likely an ester or amide). The 1H NMR data provides the following key peaks:
