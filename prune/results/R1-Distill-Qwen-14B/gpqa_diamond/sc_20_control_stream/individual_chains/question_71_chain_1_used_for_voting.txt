Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The problem says the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Same albedo for all, so that part is easy because albedo doesn't affect the temperature ratio.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between incoming starlight and outgoing infrared radiation. The formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(16πσd²))^1/4, but wait, more accurately, the formula is T = T_earth * (P_planet / P_earth)^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 - earth_albedo) )^(1/4). But since all have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) terms cancel out. So the temperature ratio depends only on the orbital periods and their distance from the star.

Wait, but wait. I think I might be mixing up orbital period and distance. Oh right, the orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. So the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So the distance d is proportional to P^(2/3), since P² ∝ d³ → d ∝ P^(2/3).

So the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_earth * ( (L / L_earth) )^(1/4) * (d_earth / d_planet )^(1/2) ), assuming same star luminosity (L same as Earth's star). But in this question, since we're taking the ratio between two planets, maybe the L cancels out.

Wait, but let me get this straight. The formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming a circular orbit) is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the planet's distance from the star.

But since all planets have the same albedo, the (1 - a) is same for all. So when taking the ratio of T4 and T2, the (1 - a) terms will cancel out.

So the ratio T4/T2 will be [ (d2 / d4 )^(1/2) ] because:

T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2) → T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2) → so T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2).

Wait, no. Let me re-derive. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (sqrt(d2) / sqrt(d4)) ) = sqrt( d2 / d4 ) = sqrt( (d2/d4) )

Wait, no, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), so higher d → lower T. So if d4 is larger than d2, T4 will be smaller than T2.

But how to find d2 and d4? Since the periods are given in a ratio, and using Kepler's law.

Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to d³. So P² ∝ d³ → d ∝ P^(2/3).

So the ratio of d4 to d2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, wait, let me think again. Let me denote the orbital periods as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, with ratios 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So P1 is 1 unit, P2 is 2 units, P3 is 2.5 units, P4 is 3.5 units, P5 is 5 units.

So d_i is proportional to (P_i)^(2/3). So d2 = (2)^(2/3) * d1, and d4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * d1. Since d1 is the reference.

So d2/d4 = [ (2)^(2/3) / (3.5)^(2/3) ) ] = [ (2/3.5) ]^(2/3) )

Simplify 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So 2/3.5 = 4/7.

So d2/d4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (d2/d4)^(1/2).

So T4/T2 = [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Because when you raise a power to a power, you multiply exponents. (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of (4/7). Let me compute that.

But 4 is 2^2, and 7 is prime. So cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, cube root of 7 is about 1.913. So 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 4/7 first: approximately 0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714 is approximately ?

Hmm, 0.8³ is 0.512, 0.83³ is about 0.571787. Oh wait, 0.83 cubed is (0.8)^3 + 3*(0.8)^2*(0.03) + 3*(0.8)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3.

Wait, alternatively, 0.83^3. Let me compute it step by step.

0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889.

0.6889 * 0.83 = let's compute:

0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112

0.6889 * 0.03 = 0.020667

Add them: 0.55112 + 0.020667 = 0.571787.

So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571787, which is very close to 4/7≈0.5714286.

Wow, so (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because T4 is the temperature of planet 4, which is further out than planet 2 (since P4 is longer than P2). So since P4 is longer, d4 is larger, so T4 should be lower than T2. So the ratio T4/T2 should be less than 1, which 0.83 is.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer would be C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature, which depends on the planet's distance from the star. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance \( d \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{d} \). Since all planets have the same albedo, the ratio of temperatures depends only on their orbital distances.

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto d^3 \), the distance \( d \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of distances between Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_4}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

To compute \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \), note that \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \). The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures \( T_4/T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Since Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2, its equilibrium temperature is lower, consistent with the ratio being less than 1. Among the given options, the closest value is \( \sim 0.83 \).

Wait, but let me get this straight. The formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming a circular orbit) is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the planet's distance from the star.

But since all planets have the same albedo, the (1 - a) is same for all. So when taking the ratio of T4 and T2, the (1 - a) terms will cancel out.

So the ratio T4/T2 will be [ (d2 / d4 )^(1/2) ] because:

T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2) → T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2) → so T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2).

Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to d³. So P² ∝ d³ → d ∝ P^(2/3).

So the ratio of d4 to d2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Wait, wait, let me think again. Let me denote the orbital periods as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, with ratios 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So P1 is 1 unit, P2 is 2 units, P3 is 2.5 units, P4 is 3.5 units, P5 is 5 units.

So d_i is proportional to (P_i)^(2/3). So d2 = (2)^(2/3) * d1, and d4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * d1. Since d1 is the reference.

So d2/d4 = [ (2)^(2/3) / (3.5)^(2/3) ) ] = [ (2/3.5) ]^(2/3) )

Simplify 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So 2/3.5 = 4/7.

So d2/d4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (d2/d4)^(1/2).

So T4/T2 = [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Because when you raise a power to a power, you multiply exponents. (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is the cube root of (4/7). Let me compute that.

But 4 is 2^2, and 7 is prime. So cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, cube root of 7 is about 1.913. So 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.83.

Hmm, 0.8³ is 0.512, 0.83³ is about 0.571787. Oh wait, 0.83 cubed is (0.8)^3 + 3*(0.8)^2*(0.03) + 3*(0.8)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3.

Wait, alternatively, 0.83^3. Let me compute it step by step.

0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889.

0.6889 * 0.83 = let's compute:

0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112

0.6889 * 0.03 = 0.020667

Add them: 0.55112 + 0.020667 = 0.571787.

So 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571787, which is very close to 4/7≈0.5714286.

Wow, so (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83. So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature, which depends on the planet's distance from the star. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance \( d \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{d} \). Since all planets have the same albedo, the ratio of temperatures depends only on their orbital distances.

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto d^3 \), the distance \( d \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of distances between Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_4}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

To compute \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \), note that \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \). The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures \( T_4/T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Since Planet_4 is farther from the star than Planet_2, its equilibrium temperature is lower, consistent with the ratio being less than 1. Among the given options, the closest value is \( \sim 0.83 \).
