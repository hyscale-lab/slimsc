Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about mutations in a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound in barley. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate this compound. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the question states that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The problem is that this gene's product is causing issues, so they're looking to mutate it. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a chemical that causes point mutations, usually by adding methyl groups, leading to transitions or transversions.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The intact gene and the mutants are given, so I need to compare them.

The gene's function is to make a compound that's anti-nutritional, so we want to disrupt its synthesis. The idea is to create a mutation that either disrupts the gene's function. This could be done by creating a premature stop codon, changing the amino acid sequence significantly, or perhaps altering the splicing sites.

Looking at the options, the mutants are 1 to 4, and the options are A to D, each corresponding to a mutant.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the wild type.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type:
Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm. Let me write the changes:

Wild: positions 3-7: TTT CTC GCT
Mutant1: positions 3-7: TCT AC GCT

Wait, let me see. Let's break it down. The first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So the first few nucleotides differ. Let's compare:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTT (in the fourth, fifth, sixth positions)
Mutant1: positions 4-6: TCT (so a change from TTT to TCT?)

Wait, maybe I should write the first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, perhaps I should index each position.

Looking at the first part, let's split the sequences into individual letters to compare.

Wild type:
Positions 1-20 (approx): A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A ...

Mutant1:
A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G C ... 

Wait, perhaps the change is in the 4th and 5th positions. Let me count:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, so the wild type has TTTCTCGCT, and mutant has TCTACG... Hmm, maybe the fourth triplet is different.

Wait, another approach: find where the differences are.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant1: ...TCTACGCTGGTACT...

So the 4th,5th,6th nucleotides are CTC in wild, and in mutant1, it's something else.

Wait, perhaps the first substitution is at position 4. Let me look at each nucleotide. Let's write the first part:

Wild: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A...

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G C...

Wait, perhaps the 4th position in the wild is T, while in mutant1 it's C? Or maybe I should look for the exact nucleotide changes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compare the two sequences.

Wait, let me write the wild and mutant 1 sequences for the first few bases:

Wild: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So comparing each position:

Let me line them up.

Wild: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A...
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G C...

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me write the first 20 nucleotides:

Wild: 1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT

Wait, looking at the first part:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTT (since positions 1-3 are ATG, then 4-6 are TTT)
Mutant1: positions 4-6: TCT (since after ATG, it's TT then CTA?)

Wait, perhaps the change is from TTT to TCT?

Wait, maybe I should index each position.

Wait, the first part of the wild is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT...

Hmm. So in the wild, the first part is ATG followed by TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc. In mutant1, it's ATG followed by TCT, then ACG, and then GCT.

So the first change is that the TTT (positions 4-6) becomes TCT (positions 4-6). Wait, no, because ATG is positions 1-3. So after ATG, the next three are TTT (positions 4-6). In mutant1, after ATG, the next three are TCT (positions 4-6). So the second codon (position 4-6) in the wild is TTT (Phe), but in mutant1, it's TCT (Ser). That's a substitution from Phe to Ser.

Then, the next codon in wild is CTC (Leu, positions 7-9), but in mutant1, it's ACG (Thr, positions 7-9). So that's another substitution.

So two codon changes in the first part. So mutant1 has Phe -> Ser and Leu -> Thr.

But wait, how does that affect the protein? Well, amino acid changes might affect the function. But unless it's a critical residue, maybe the protein is still functional. So if the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, perhaps we need to disrupt the gene so it doesn't produce the compound. So a frameshift would cause a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, leading to a nonfunctional protein. Or a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) would truncate the protein.

Looking at the other mutants.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to wild:

Wild has ...CTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACT...

So after the ATG, in wild it's TTTCTCGCT, but in mutant2, it's TCTAAGCT. Wait, let me see.

Breaking down:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, so after ATG, mutant2's next three are TCT (positions 4-6, same as mutant1). Then AAG (positions 7-9), then C GCT? Or perhaps the next triplet is AAG. So in mutant2, the changes are:

- Position 4-6: TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe)
- Position 7-9: AAG (Lys) instead of CTC (Leu)
- Then, position 10-12: GCT (same as wild)

Wait, but in mutant2, after AAG, the next is C GCT? Or is the structure different.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in mutant2 is a change from CTC GCT to AAG C in the middle. Alternatively, perhaps it's a larger change. Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact nucleotide differences.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant2: ...TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the wild has TTCTC GCT, and mutant2 has TCTAA GCT. Wait, perhaps the change is at position 7.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a point mutation that changes the reading frame. For example, an insertion or deletion would cause a frameshift, but the sequences here don't indicate any insertions or deletions—only substitutions.

Wait, the question says that the mutations are in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here would affect the protein unless it's in a non-conserved region.

But the key is that we want to eliminate the gene's product. So either a frameshift leading to a premature stop, or a substitution that disrupts a critical function.

Looking at Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Compare to wild:

Wild: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...
Mutant3: ...TGT CAC T TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, perhaps the change is in the middle.

Wild: ...ACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant3: ...GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, so in the wild, the sequence after ...GGT is ACT TCT GTG TGA. In mutant3, it's GT CAC T TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, perhaps the 10th to 12th positions are different. Let me see.

Wild: ...GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the wild has GGT ACT TCT GTG, whereas mutant3 has GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG.

Wait, so in the wild: after GGT is ACT (Thr), then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val). In mutant3, after GGT is GTC (Val), then ACT (Thr), then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val).

So the change is from ACT to GTC. So the codon for Thr becomes Val. So that's an amino acid change from Thr to Val. But that may not be a drastic change. Unless this is a critical part of the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps in mutant3, the six nucleotides after GGT change. Let me look again.

In the wild: GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

In mutant3: GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

So the change is from ACT to GTC. Wait, but wait, the positions would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for any changes that lead to frameshifts or premature stop codons.

Wait, the wild type ends with ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant3 ends with ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, but wait, the middle part in mutant3 is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly. Let me write the sequences.

Wild: ...GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So the wild has 'ACT' after GGT; mutant3 has 'GTC'.

So the wild is GGT ACT TCT..., mutant3 is GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, so in the wild, the codon after GGT is ACT ( Thr ), and in mutant3 it's GTC ( Val ). So the amino acid changes from Thr to Val. So just another substitution.

Hmm.

Now, looking at Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the wild has GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Mutant4 has GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, so the wild has GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG.

Mutant4 has GCT ACT TCT GTG.

Wait, so perhaps the GGT (glycine) is changed. Wait, perhaps in mutant4, the sequence after GCT is ACT instead of GGT.

Wait, let's break it down.

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So the wild has GCT followed by GGT, then ACT. So the wild is GCT GGT ACT. In mutant4, after GCT comes ACT, so GCT ACT.

Ah, so in the wild, the triplet after GCT is GGT (glycine), but in mutant4, it's ACT. So the triplet is changed from GGT to ACT.

GGT is Gly, ACT is Thr. So another substitution.

But wait, looking at the entire sequence, perhaps in mutant4, the GGT is replaced with ACT, which is a substitution of Gly to Thr. But again, that's a single amino acid change.

Wait, but in the initial part of mutant4, let's see:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, in mutant4, the first part after ATG is TTTTACGCT... ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wild starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant4 starts with ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...

So, the wild has ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT.

Mutant4 has ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT.

So, the first part: after ATG, the wild has TTT CTC GCT, and mutant4 has TTTT ACG C.

Wait, perhaps I should compare nucleotides one by one.

Wild: positions 1-20: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A...

Mutant4: A T G T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G T G A...

Wait, maybe the wild has TTTCTCGCTG, and mutant4 has TT TTA CGCTA.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for any insertions or deletions because that would cause a frameshift.

Wait, in the wild, the sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

In mutant4, it's TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the wild has:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, so in the wild, after ATG, it's TTT CTC GCT, whereas in mutant4, after ATG, it's TTT TAC GCT.

Wait, perhaps there's a deletion or an insertion. Let me count the number of bases.

Wild: ATG is 3, then TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... So the next part is 3*5=15, plus 3 for ATG, so 18, but perhaps the first part is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the letters in the given sequences.

Wild: the first part given is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm, let me count the letters in the initial part:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... Let's count:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

That's (3) + (3) + (3) + (3) + (3) + (3) = 18 nucleotides.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So, same length.

Wait, but in the mutant4, after ATG, the next triplet is TTT, then TAC, then GCT, ACT, etc.

So, no insertions or deletions, just substitutions.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps in mutant4, the first part is ATGTTTTACGCTACT... So after ATG, it's TTTT (four Ts?), but that can't be because the reading frame is maintained.

Wait, that can't be right because the sequences are written as continuous. So perhaps the structure is:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So, in the wild, the second codon after ATG is TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

In mutant4, the second codon is TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

Wait, so the change is in the third codon. Wild has CTC (Leu) and mutant4 has TAC (Tyr). So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr.

Hmm, that's an amino acid change but probably not a frame shift since the number of nucleotides hasn't changed.

So, all the mutants have substitutions, no insertions or deletions, so no frameshifts. So the only way to disrupt the gene is by causing a premature stop codon.

Looking at the sequences again, the wild type ends with ...GTCGT…TGA-3’. So the stop codon is TGA.

Mutant1: ...GTCGC…TGA.

So the last part is ...GTCGC…TGA. So the last codon before TGA is GCG (Ala?), then TGA.

Wait, wait, the wild type's last codon before stop is GTG (Val), then TGA.

Mutant1's last part is GTCGC…TGA. So the last codons are GTC (Val), then G C... Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the wild sequence ends with ...GTCGT…TGA.

So, the last few codons would be GTC (Val), GT (but GT is incomplete, but wait, in the wild, perhaps it's ...GTC GTG TGA.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for any occurrence of a stop codon earlier in the sequence.

In the wild, the stop is at the end, so TGA.

In the mutants, are any of them introducing a stop codon earlier?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: does it have a stop codon before the end? Let's see.

Mutant1's sequence ends with ...GTCGC…TGA. So the last codon is GCG (Ala) before TGA.

Wait, the sequence is ...GTCGC…TGA. So the last part is GTC (Val), GCG (Ala), then TGA. So no premature stop.

Mutant2: ...GTCGC…TGA. Similarly, no premature stop.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same as wild, so no premature stop.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same as wild.

Wait, but perhaps in the middle, a stop codon has been introduced.

Looking again at Mutant3:

Mutant3's sequence is ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons in the middle.

In the middle, perhaps the sequence is ACT TCT GTG, then TGA.

Wait, but the TGA is the stop. So no, in all the mutants, the stop codon hasn't changed.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a nonsense mutation earlier in the sequence.

Another approach: look for any of the mutations that introduce a stop codon before the original stop.

But looking at the sequences, I don't see any other TGA, TAG, or TAA codons in the middle.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, there's a change in the middle that creates a stop codon.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence is:

...GCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Looking at the middle: ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, the TGA is the stop, but is there another stop codon earlier?

In Mutant4, the sequence after GCT is ACT, TCT, GTG. So I don't see any stop codons until the end.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: which mutation disrupts the reading frame, causing a frameshift? But earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions, no indels.

Wait, looking again at the sequences, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check Mutant4 again.

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So in the wild, after GCT, it's GGT ( Gly ), then ACT ( Thr ), TCT ( Ser ), GTG ( Val ), TGA ( stop ).

In mutant4, after GCT, it's ACT ( Thr ), then TCT ( Ser ), GTG ( Val ), TGA ( stop ). So GGT is replaced by ACT.

So, the codon GGT becomes ACT. That's a substitution from Gly to Thr. So, no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the issue is in the first exon. The first exon is the first part of the gene, so perhaps any mutation in the start codon or the initial exons could disrupt the protein significantly.

Wait, the start codon is ATG. In all the mutants, it's intact.

Looking at each mutant's initial codons:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG C...

Wait, no, I'm not seeing a frameshift.

Wait, another thing: perhaps a mutation in the splice sites. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area. So probably not affecting splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe one of the mutations introduces a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any occurrence of TAG, TAA, or TGA in the middle of the gene.

Looking at Mutant1: the sequence is ...GTCGC…TGA. So the stop is at the end.

Mutant2: ...GTCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA.

Mutant4: same.

Wait, in mutant3, the sequence before the stop is ...TGTGGATGAACATATT...

Oh wait, wait! Let me look at this again.

In mutant3: the sequence is ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking it down:

GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, so in the middle, after GGT, it's GTC, then ACT, TCT, GTG, TGA.

So, the fourth codon is ACT (Thr), fifth is TCT (Ser), sixth is GTG (Val), then TGA (stop).

So, no premature stop.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, after the GCT, the sequence is ACT TCT GTG TGA.

No stop codon in the middle.

Hmm. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me think about the exons. The gene has five exons and four introns. So the first exon is the first part, after which comes an intron, then exon 2, etc.

Mutations in the first exon might be in the beginning of the gene, perhaps the start codon or the initial exons.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the mutations cause a frameshift. Frameshifts change the reading frame from the mutation point onward, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and usually a nonfunctional protein.

But looking at the sequences, I don't see any insertions or deletions; all are substitutions. So all the mutants are in-frame substitutions.

So, another approach: which substitution would most likely disrupt the function of the gene's product.

If the product is an enzyme, perhaps a substitution in an active site would disable it. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best way is to find which mutation creates a stop codon earlier, thus truncating the protein.

Wait, perhaps I missed a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, looking again at the sequences:

Wild: ...GTCGT…TGA.

Mutant1: ...GTCGC…TGA.

Mutant2: ...GTCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA.

Mutant4: same as wild.

Wait, in Mutant1, after GTC is G C, which is GCG (Ala), then TGA.

In Mutant4, the sequence is ...GTCGT…TGA. So same as wild.

So, no premature stops.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations changes the reading frame, causing all downstream amino acids to be wrong, but that would require a frameshift. Since all substitutions are in-frame, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the number of nucleotides.

Each mutant's sequence is the same length as the wild type, so no insertions or deletions, so no frameshifts.

So the only way to disrupt the gene is via a substitution that creates a stop codon. But I don't see any in the mutants except the original TGA at the end.

Wait, perhaps one of the mutations introduces a stop codon elsewhere.

Looking again:

In mutant3, the sequence is ...ACT TCT GTG TGA.

No, that's wild-type.

Wait, perhaps in mutant2, the sequence is ...GTCGC... TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's function by causing a nonfunctional protein. So any inactivating mutation, like a substitution that disrupts the active site, but without knowing which part is important, perhaps the best bet is to look for a mutation that disrupts the start codon or the initiation.

But all mutants have the same start codon: ATG.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon early in the sequence.

Wait, in mutant4, perhaps the sequence after the mutation introduces a TAA or TAG codon.

Wait, let's look at Mutant4's sequence.

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

So the codons are:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

No stop codons before TGA, so no.

Wait, what about in Mutant3: the sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me write the first part of each mutant as codons.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG C.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, as it's not grouped into triplets correctly.

Wait, perhaps the sequences are written in a way that the exons are continuous, so perhaps the first exon's end is after the first few codons.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4, the mutation changes the codon from GCT (Ala) to something else. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the gene is structured. The gene has five exons. If the mutation is in the first exon, which is the beginning of the gene, perhaps disrupting the start codon or the initial exons would prevent the gene from being properly transcribed or translated.

But all the mutations are in the first exon, and the start codon is intact in all mutants.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a mutation in the first exon that disrupts an important region, like the promoter, but the question says the mutations are in the gene, so probably in the coding region.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the mutants introduces a stop codon earlier.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, the codons would be:

ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, TGA.

No stop codon until the end.

In Mutant3, the codons are:

ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, GTC, ACT, TCT, GTG, TGA.

Wait, GTC is Val, so no stop.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about which mutation is most likely to disrupt the gene.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2 because it changes a longer stretch, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, the first part after ATG is TTCTAAGCTG.

So, the codons would be:

ATG, TCT (Ser), TAA (stop), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Wait a minute! Wait, let me look at Mutant2's sequence again.

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC.

Wait, that can't be right because the sequence is longer. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the correct grouping is:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC.

So, the second codon is TTC (Phe), third is TAA (stop).

Oh! So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon.

So, the sequence would be:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAA (stop), then the rest.

So, this would cause a premature stop codon after the second amino acid. Thus, the protein would be severely truncated, likely nonfunctional.

Ah! So this would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So, Mutant2 introduces a stop codon at the third codon (TAA), causing the protein to terminate early.

So, the correct answer is Mutant2, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Wild Type Sequence**:
   - `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - The stop codon (`TGA`) is at the end of the sequence.

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the first few codons:
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser)
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `ACG` (Thr)
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the first few codons:
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser)
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `AAG` (Lys)
   - A premature stop codon (`TAA`) is introduced at the third codon. This truncates the protein early, likely rendering it nonfunctional.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the middle of the sequence:
     - `ACT` (Thr) → `GTC` (Val)
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the middle of the sequence:
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr)
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

### Conclusion:
The only mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is **Mutant 2**, where the third codon becomes `TAA` (stop). This truncates the protein early, effectively eliminating the gene's function and the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about mutations in a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound in barley. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate this compound. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the question states that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The problem is that this gene's product is causing issues, so they're looking to mutate it. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a chemical that causes point mutations, usually by adding methyl groups, leading to transitions or transversions.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The intact gene and the mutants are given, so I need to compare them.

The gene's function is to make a compound that's anti-nutritional, so we want to disrupt its synthesis. The idea is to create a mutation that either disrupts the gene's function. This could be done by creating a premature stop codon, changing the amino acid sequence significantly, or perhaps altering the splicing sites.

Looking at the options, the mutants are 1 to 4, and the options are A to D, each corresponding to a mutant.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the wild type.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type:
Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm. Let me write the changes:

Wild: positions 3-7: TTT CTC GCT
Mutant1: positions 3-7: TCT AC GCT

Wait, let me see. Let's break it down. The first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So the first few nucleotides differ. Let's compare:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTT (in the fourth, fifth, sixth positions)
Mutant1: positions 4-6: TCT (so a change from TTT to TCT?)

Wait, maybe I should write the first part:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, perhaps I should index each position.

Looking at the first part, let's split the sequences into individual letters to compare.

Wild type:
Positions 1-20 (approx): A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A ...

Mutant1:
A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G C ... 

Wait, perhaps the change is in the 4th and 5th positions. Let me count:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, so the wild type has TTTCTCGCT, and mutant has TCTACG... Hmm, maybe the fourth triplet is different.

Wait, another approach: find where the differences are.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant1: ...TCTACGCTGGTACT...

So the 4th,5th,6th nucleotides are CTC in wild, and in mutant1, it's something else.

Wait, perhaps the first substitution is at position 4. Let me look at each nucleotide. Let's write the first part:

Wild: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A...

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G C...

Wait, perhaps the 4th position in the wild is T, while in mutant1 it's C? Or maybe I should look for the exact nucleotide changes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compare the two sequences.

Wait, let me write the wild and mutant 1 sequences for the first few bases:

Wild: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So comparing each position:

Let me line them up.

Wild: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A...
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G C...

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me write the first 20 nucleotides:

Wild: 1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT

Wait, looking at the first part:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTT (since positions 1-3 are ATG, then 4-6 are TTT)
Mutant1: positions 4-6: TCT (since after ATG, it's TT then CTA?)

Wait, perhaps the change is from TTT to TCT?

Wait, maybe I should index each position.

Wait, the first part of the wild is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT...

Hmm. So in the wild, the first part is ATG followed by TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc. In mutant1, it's ATG followed by TCT, then ACG, and then GCT.

So the first change is that the TTT (positions 4-6) becomes TCT (positions 4-6). Wait, no, because ATG is positions 1-3. So after ATG, the next three are TTT (positions 4-6). In mutant1, after ATG, the next three are TCT (positions 4-6). So the second codon (position 4-6) in the wild is TTT (Phe), but in mutant1, it's TCT (Ser). That's a substitution from Phe to Ser.

Then, the next codon in wild is CTC (Leu, positions 7-9), but in mutant1, it's ACG (Thr, positions 7-9). So that's another substitution.

So two codon changes in the first part. So mutant1 has Phe -> Ser and Leu -> Thr.

But wait, how does that affect the protein? Well, amino acid changes might affect the function. But unless it's a critical residue, maybe the protein is still functional. So if the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, perhaps we need to disrupt the gene so it doesn't produce the compound. So a frameshift would cause a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, leading to a nonfunctional protein. Or a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) would truncate the protein.

Looking at the other mutants.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to wild:

Wild has ...CTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACT...

So after the ATG, in wild it's TTTCTCGCT, but in mutant2, it's TCTAAGCT. Wait, let me see.

Breaking down:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, so after ATG, mutant2's next three are TCT (positions 4-6, same as mutant1). Then AAG (positions 7-9), then C GCT? Or perhaps the next triplet is AAG. So in mutant2, the changes are:

- Position 4-6: TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe)
- Position 7-9: AAG (Lys) instead of CTC (Leu)
- Then, position 10-12: GCT (same as wild)

Wait, but in mutant2, after AAG, the next is C GCT? Or is the structure different.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in mutant2 is a change from CTC GCT to AAG C in the middle. Alternatively, perhaps it's a larger change. Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact nucleotide differences.

Looking at the sequences:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant2: ...TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the wild has TTCTC GCT, and mutant2 has TCTAA GCT. Wait, perhaps the change is at position 7.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a point mutation that changes the reading frame. For example, an insertion or deletion would cause a frameshift, but the sequences here don't indicate any insertions or deletions—only substitutions.

Wait, the question says that the mutations are in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here would affect the protein unless it's in a non-conserved region.

But the key is that we want to eliminate the gene's product. So either a frameshift leading to a premature stop, or a substitution that disrupts a critical function.

Looking at Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Compare to wild:

Wild: ...ACT TCT GTG TGA...
Mutant3: ...TGT CAC T TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, perhaps the change is in the middle.

Wild: ...ACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant3: ...GTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, so in the wild, the sequence after ...GGT is ACT TCT GTG TGA. In mutant3, it's GT CAC T TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, perhaps the 10th to 12th positions are different. Let me see.

Wild: ...GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the wild has GGT ACT TCT GTG, whereas mutant3 has GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG.

Wait, so in the wild: after GGT is ACT (Thr), then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val). In mutant3, after GGT is GTC (Val), then ACT (Thr), then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val).

So the change is from ACT to GTC. So the codon for Thr becomes Val. So that's an amino acid change from Thr to Val. But that may not be a drastic change. Unless this is a critical part of the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps in mutant3, the six nucleotides after GGT change. Let me look again.

In the wild: GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

In mutant3: GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

So the change is from ACT to GTC. Wait, but wait, the positions would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for any changes that lead to frameshifts or premature stop codons.

Wait, the wild type ends with ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant3 ends with ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, but wait, the middle part in mutant3 is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly. Let me write the sequences.

Wild: ...GGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So the wild has 'ACT' after GGT; mutant3 has 'GTC'.

So the wild is GGT ACT TCT..., mutant3 is GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, so in the wild, the codon after GGT is ACT ( Thr ), and in mutant3 it's GTC ( Val ). So the amino acid changes from Thr to Val. So just another substitution.

Hmm.

Now, looking at Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, the wild has GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Mutant4 has GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, so the wild has GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG.

Mutant4 has GCT ACT TCT GTG.

Wait, so perhaps the GGT (glycine) is changed. Wait, perhaps in mutant4, the sequence after GCT is ACT instead of GGT.

Wait, let's break it down.

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So the wild has GCT followed by GGT, then ACT. So the wild is GCT GGT ACT. In mutant4, after GCT comes ACT, so GCT ACT.

Ah, so in the wild, the triplet after GCT is GGT (glycine), but in mutant4, it's ACT. So the triplet is changed from GGT to ACT.

GGT is Gly, ACT is Thr. So another substitution.

But wait, looking at the entire sequence, perhaps in mutant4, the GGT is replaced with ACT, which is a substitution of Gly to Thr. But again, that's a single amino acid change.

Wait, but in the initial part of mutant4, let's see:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, in mutant4, the first part after ATG is TTTTACGCT... ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wild starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant4 starts with ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...

So, the wild has ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT.

Mutant4 has ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT.

So, the first part: after ATG, the wild has TTT CTC GCT, and mutant4 has TTTT ACG C.

Wait, perhaps I should compare nucleotides one by one.

Wild: positions 1-20: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G T G A...

Mutant4: A T G T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G T G A...

Wait, maybe the wild has TTTCTCGCTG, and mutant4 has TT TTA CGCTA.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for any insertions or deletions because that would cause a frameshift.

Wait, in the wild, the sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

In mutant4, it's TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the wild has:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Wait, so in the wild, after ATG, it's TTT CTC GCT, whereas in mutant4, after ATG, it's TTT TAC GCT.

Wait, perhaps there's a deletion or an insertion. Let me count the number of bases.

Wild: ATG is 3, then TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... So the next part is 3*5=15, plus 3 for ATG, so 18, but perhaps the first part is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the letters in the given sequences.

Wild: the first part given is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm, let me count the letters in the initial part:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... Let's count:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

That's (3) + (3) + (3) + (3) + (3) + (3) = 18 nucleotides.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So, same length.

Wait, but in the mutant4, after ATG, the next triplet is TTT, then TAC, then GCT, ACT, etc.

So, no insertions or deletions, just substitutions.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps in mutant4, the first part is ATGTTTTACGCTACT... So after ATG, it's TTTT (four Ts?), but that can't be because the reading frame is maintained.

Wait, that can't be right because the sequences are written as continuous. So perhaps the structure is:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So, in the wild, the second codon after ATG is TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

In mutant4, the second codon is TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

Wait, so the change is in the third codon. Wild has CTC (Leu) and mutant4 has TAC (Tyr). So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr.

Hmm, that's an amino acid change but probably not a frame shift since the number of nucleotides hasn't changed.

So, all the mutants have substitutions, no insertions or deletions, so no frameshifts. So the only way to disrupt the gene is by causing a premature stop codon.

Looking at the sequences again, the wild type ends with ...GTCGT…TGA-3’. So the stop codon is TGA.

Mutant1: ...GTCGC…TGA.

So the last part is ...GTCGC…TGA. So the last codon before TGA is GCG (Ala?), then TGA.

Wait, wait, the wild type's last codon before stop is GTG (Val), then TGA.

Mutant1's last part is GTCGC…TGA. So the last codons are GTC (Val), then G C... Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the wild sequence ends with ...GTCGT…TGA.

So, the last few codons would be GTC (Val), GT (but GT is incomplete, but wait, in the wild, perhaps it's ...GTC GTG TGA.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for any occurrence of a stop codon earlier in the sequence.

In the wild, the stop is at the end, so TGA.

In the mutants, are any of them introducing a stop codon earlier?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: does it have a stop codon before the end? Let's see.

Mutant1's sequence ends with ...GTCGC…TGA. So the last codon is GCG (Ala) before TGA.

Wait, the sequence is ...GTCGC…TGA. So the last part is GTC (Val), GCG (Ala), then TGA. So no premature stop.

Mutant2: ...GTCGC…TGA. Similarly, no premature stop.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same as wild, so no premature stop.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same as wild.

Wait, but perhaps in the middle, a stop codon has been introduced.

Looking again at Mutant3:

Mutant3's sequence is ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons in the middle.

In the middle, perhaps the sequence is ACT TCT GTG, then TGA.

Wait, but the TGA is the stop. So no, in all the mutants, the stop codon hasn't changed.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a nonsense mutation earlier in the sequence.

Another approach: look for any of the mutations that introduce a stop codon before the original stop.

But looking at the sequences, I don't see any other TGA, TAG, or TAA codons in the middle.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, there's a change in the middle that creates a stop codon.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence is:

...GCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Looking at the middle: ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, the TGA is the stop, but is there another stop codon earlier?

In Mutant4, the sequence after GCT is ACT, TCT, GTG. So I don't see any stop codons until the end.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: which mutation disrupts the reading frame, causing a frameshift? But earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions, no indels.

Wait, looking again at the sequences, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check Mutant4 again.

Wild: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

So in the wild, after GCT, it's GGT ( Gly ), then ACT ( Thr ), TCT ( Ser ), GTG ( Val ), TGA ( stop ).

In mutant4, after GCT, it's ACT ( Thr ), then TCT ( Ser ), GTG ( Val ), TGA ( stop ). So GGT is replaced by ACT.

So, the codon GGT becomes ACT. That's a substitution from Gly to Thr. So, no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the issue is in the first exon. The first exon is the first part of the gene, so perhaps any mutation in the start codon or the initial exons could disrupt the protein significantly.

Wait, the start codon is ATG. In all the mutants, it's intact.

Looking at each mutant's initial codons:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG C...

Wait, no, I'm not seeing a frameshift.

Wait, another thing: perhaps a mutation in the splice sites. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area. So probably not affecting splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe one of the mutations introduces a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any occurrence of TAG, TAA, or TGA in the middle of the gene.

Looking at Mutant1: the sequence is ...GTCGC…TGA. So the stop is at the end.

Mutant2: ...GTCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA.

Mutant4: same.

Wait, in mutant3, the sequence before the stop is ...TGTGGATGAACATATT...

Oh wait, wait! Let me look at this again.

In mutant3: the sequence is ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking it down:

GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Wait, so in the middle, after GGT, it's GTC, then ACT, TCT, GTG, TGA.

So, the fourth codon is ACT (Thr), fifth is TCT (Ser), sixth is GTG (Val), then TGA (stop).

So, no premature stop.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, after the GCT, the sequence is ACT TCT GTG TGA.

No stop codon in the middle.

Hmm. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me think about the exons. The gene has five exons and four introns. So the first exon is the first part, after which comes an intron, then exon 2, etc.

Mutations in the first exon might be in the beginning of the gene, perhaps the start codon or the initial exons.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the mutations cause a frameshift. Frameshifts change the reading frame from the mutation point onward, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence and usually a nonfunctional protein.

But looking at the sequences, I don't see any insertions or deletions; all are substitutions. So all the mutants are in-frame substitutions.

So, another approach: which substitution would most likely disrupt the function of the gene's product.

If the product is an enzyme, perhaps a substitution in an active site would disable it. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best way is to find which mutation creates a stop codon earlier, thus truncating the protein.

Wait, perhaps I missed a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, looking again at the sequences:

Wild: ...GTCGT…TGA.

Mutant1: ...GTCGC…TGA.

Mutant2: ...GTCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA.

Mutant4: same as wild.

Wait, in Mutant1, after GTC is G C, which is GCG (Ala), then TGA.

In Mutant4, the sequence is ...GTCGT…TGA. So same as wild.

So, no premature stops.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations changes the reading frame, causing all downstream amino acids to be wrong, but that would require a frameshift. Since all substitutions are in-frame, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the number of nucleotides.

Each mutant's sequence is the same length as the wild type, so no insertions or deletions, so no frameshifts.

So the only way to disrupt the gene is via a substitution that creates a stop codon. But I don't see any in the mutants except the original TGA at the end.

Wait, perhaps one of the mutations introduces a stop codon elsewhere.

Looking again:

In mutant3, the sequence is ...ACT TCT GTG TGA.

No, that's wild-type.

Wait, perhaps in mutant2, the sequence is ...GTCGC... TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's function by causing a nonfunctional protein. So any inactivating mutation, like a substitution that disrupts the active site, but without knowing which part is important, perhaps the best bet is to look for a mutation that disrupts the start codon or the initiation.

But all mutants have the same start codon: ATG.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon early in the sequence.

Wait, in mutant4, perhaps the sequence after the mutation introduces a TAA or TAG codon.

Wait, let's look at Mutant4's sequence.

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

So the codons are:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), TGA (stop).

No stop codons before TGA, so no.

Wait, what about in Mutant3: the sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me write the first part of each mutant as codons.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG C.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, as it's not grouped into triplets correctly.

Wait, perhaps the sequences are written in a way that the exons are continuous, so perhaps the first exon's end is after the first few codons.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4, the mutation changes the codon from GCT (Ala) to something else. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the gene is structured. The gene has five exons. If the mutation is in the first exon, which is the beginning of the gene, perhaps disrupting the start codon or the initial exons would prevent the gene from being properly transcribed or translated.

But all the mutations are in the first exon, and the start codon is intact in all mutants.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a mutation in the first exon that disrupts an important region, like the promoter, but the question says the mutations are in the gene, so probably in the coding region.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the mutants introduces a stop codon earlier.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, the codons would be:

ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, TGA.

No stop codon until the end.

In Mutant3, the codons are:

ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, GTC, ACT, TCT, GTG, TGA.

Wait, GTC is Val, so no stop.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about which mutation is most likely to disrupt the gene.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2 because it changes a longer stretch, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, the first part after ATG is TTCTAAGCTG.

So, the codons would be:

ATG, TCT (Ser), TAA (stop), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Wait a minute! Wait, let me look at Mutant2's sequence again.

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC.

Wait, that can't be right because the sequence is longer. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the correct grouping is:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC.

So, the second codon is TTC (Phe), third is TAA (stop).

Oh! So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon.

So, the sequence would be:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAA (stop), then the rest.

So, this would cause a premature stop codon after the second amino acid. Thus, the protein would be severely truncated, likely nonfunctional.

Ah! So this would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So, Mutant2 introduces a stop codon at the third codon (TAA), causing the protein to terminate early.

So, the correct answer is Mutant2, which is option A.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Wild Type Sequence**:
   - `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - The stop codon (`TGA`) is at the end of the sequence.

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the first few codons:
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser)
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `ACG` (Thr)
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the first few codons:
     - `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser)
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `AAG` (Lys)
   - A premature stop codon (`TAA`) is introduced at the third codon. This truncates the protein early, likely rendering it nonfunctional.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the middle of the sequence:
     - `ACT` (Thr) → `GTC` (Val)
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Substitutions occur in the middle of the sequence:
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr)
   - No premature stop codon is introduced. The stop codon remains at the end.

### Conclusion:
The only mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is **Mutant 2**, where the third codon becomes `TAA` (stop). This truncates the protein early, effectively eliminating the gene's function and the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: A**
