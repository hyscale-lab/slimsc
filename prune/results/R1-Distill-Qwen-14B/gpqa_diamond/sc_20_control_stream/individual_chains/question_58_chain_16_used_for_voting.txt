Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems, so regularization is a way to handle them, making the calculations finite and then taking a limit where the regulator is removed.

Wait, but the question is about which theory doesn't require this regularization. So I guess I'm looking for a theory that doesn't have these kinds of divergences in the first place.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I'm a bit fuzzy on string theory details. I remember that in string theory, particles are replaced by strings, and it's supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. Quantum gravity is a place where things get tricky because combining quantum mechanics with gravity can lead to issues like non-renormalizable divergences. But wait, string theory is supposed to be a candidate for a theory that doesn't require renormalization because it's background-independent and perhaps has a different way of handling interactions. Or does it? Maybe I'm confusing this with something else. I think string theory might actually require regularization or maybe not. I'm a bit unsure here.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory. It deals with quarks and gluons. But wait, QCD does have issues with things like Landau poles and confinement. Oh, but wait, when you calculate loop diagrams in QCD, like beta functions, you end up with divergences. So I think they do use renormalization techniques. But do they require regularization? Well, I think regularization is a part of the process when doing these calculations. So QCD probably does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory. Renormalization is a way to handle the infinities that come up in loop calculations. So yes, QED definitely requires regularization because of these divergences. Otherwise, the calculations would be meaningless because of those infinities.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't involve the same kind of infinities as quantum theories, right? In classical electromagnetism, you have Maxwell's equations, which are well-behaved. Even when charges are point particles, the fields might have singularities at the points, but in practice, they don't lead to the same sort of divergences that quantum theories have. So in a classical theory, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum field theory. Regularization is a quantum mechanical concept to handle divergences in perturbation theory.

So putting it together, the question is which theory never requires regularization. All the quantum theories (A, B, C) probably require regularization because they handle divergences. Only the classical theory, option D, doesn't need regularization. So the answer should be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the nature of regularization and the theories listed:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring Theory is a candidate for quantum gravity and involves strings rather than point particles. While it is designed to avoid some divergences, it still requires regularization in certain calculations, such as handling loop diagrams. Thus, it does require regularization.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, describing quarks and gluons. It is a non-abelian gauge theory that deals with divergences, such as those in beta functions and loop calculations. Regularization is necessary in QCD to handle these infinities.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a renormalizable quantum field theory. It explicitly requires regularization to handle divergences in loop calculations, as seen in the renormalization process.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical Electrodynamics, based on Maxwell's equations, does not involve quantum mechanical divergences or the need for regularization. It is a well-behaved classical theory that does not require such techniques.

Since regularization is a quantum mechanical concept used to handle divergences in quantum field theories, only the classical theory—Classical Electrodynamics—never requires regularization.
