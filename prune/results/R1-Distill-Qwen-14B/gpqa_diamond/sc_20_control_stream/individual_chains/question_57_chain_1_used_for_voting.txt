Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, elastic scattering... right, that's when the incident particles (like electrons) collide with target particles (maybe nucleons in the nucleus) and then scatter off without changing their energy. Phase shifts are involved in the scattering amplitude, I remember that from quantum mechanics.

The problem gives me several phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and tells me to ignore the rest. So these are the first five phase shifts, I guess up to l=4 because the index starts at 0.

The formula for the scattering amplitude, I think it's something like f(θ) being a sum over these phase shifts. The imaginary part of the amplitude is given by a specific expression. Wait, the imaginary part is tied to the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem comes into play here, but maybe I don't need that right now.

I remember the formula for the total scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) in terms of partial waves. Along the beam direction, which would be θ=0°, right? So the direction where the particle comes in along the beam axis. So the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 would depend on the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by certain factors.

Wait, the general expression for the scattering amplitude f is f = sum over l of ( (2l +1)/ (2k) ) * ( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since we're looking for the imaginary part along the beam direction, θ=0. So cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(x)=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. Wait, no—wait, the Legendre polynomials at x=1 are all 1? No, I think P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)= (3*(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. Hmm, actually, for even l, P_l(1)=1, but for odd l, like l=3, P_3(1)=1 as well. Wait, let me think. P_l(1) is 1 for all l because P_l(1)=1. Yeah, because the generating function at x=1 gives all P_l(1)=1. So that's helpful.

So when θ=0, the sum reduces to just summing terms without any angular dependence beyond the phase shifts. So the imaginary part of f would be the sum over l of ( (2l +1)/(2k) ) * sin(δ_l), because e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so the imaginary part is sin δ_l.

Wait, but the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So, I'm summing over l=0 to 4. Each term is (2l +1)/(2k) multiplied by sin(δ_l).

But wait, what is k? The wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to find k in terms of their momentum. Electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e, so non-relativistic approximations might not hold. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic expression for k.

The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE) when E is much larger than m, but wait, relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So for high energy, E ≈ pc. So then k = p/(ħ) = E/(ħ c) * (c / ħ) ? Wait, no. Let me think about units. Planck constant ħ has units of J·s. The wave number k is in 1/m. So, from E = ħ c k, because for a free particle, E = ħ ω and ω = c k. So, k = E/(ħ c). 

Wait, E is given in MeV. Let me convert that to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 50 MeV is 50e6 eV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s. So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) = calculate denominator: 1.0545718e-34 *3e8 ≈3.1637e-26. So 8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 ≈ approx 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, but that seems really high. Did I do that right? Let me double-check. Oh, wait, E is 50 MeV, which is about 50 million eV. Let me make sure about the conversion.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 50 MeV is 50,000,000 eV. So 50,000,000 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-12 J? Wait wait, no: 10^6 eV is a MeV. So 50e6 eV is 50 MeV. So 50e6 *1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J, which is what I had before. So yes, k is 8.01e-13 / (1.0545718e-34 *3e8) = 8.01e-13 / (3.1637e-26) ) ≈ approx 2.53e13 m⁻¹.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a simpler way. Oh, because the options are given in fermi (fm), which is 1e-15 meters. So perhaps I can find k in inverse fermis.

Let me think, 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 1 m⁻¹ is 1e-15 fm⁻¹. So if k is 2.53e13 m⁻¹, that's 2.53e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ = 2.53e-2 fm⁻¹. Hmm, that's about 0.0253 fm⁻¹. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute k. E is 50 MeV.

E (Joules) = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) ) = 8.01e-13 / (3.1637e-26) ) → approx 2.53e13 m⁻¹.

So 2.53e13 m⁻¹ is 2.53e13 / (1e15 fm) ) → 2.53e-2 fm⁻¹. So ≈ 0.0253 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ. Wait, but that's for non-relativistic case. Hmm, but since the energy is 50 MeV, which is way above the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV), the energy is highly relativistic. So E = pc, so p = E/(c). Then, ħ k = p → k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c). Which is what I used earlier. So that's correct.

So k = 2.53e13 m⁻¹, which is 0.0253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate the denominator: ħ c = 1.0545718e-34 * 3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J·m. So E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (3.1637e-26 J·m) ) = 8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26 = approximately 2.534e13 m⁻¹.

So 2.534e13 m⁻¹ = 2.534e13 * (1e-15 m)⁻¹ → wait, no, 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1 m⁻¹ = 1e-15 fm⁻¹. So 2.534e13 m⁻¹ is 2.534e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ = 2.534e-2 fm⁻¹.

Wait, 2.534e-2 is 0.02534 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, okay, but maybe I can calculate it as 2.53e-2 fm⁻¹.

Now, the sum for the imaginary part of f is sum_{l=0 to 4} [ (2l +1) / (2k) ) * sin(δ_l) ].

So let me compute each term. The sum is from l=0 to 4. l=0,1,2,3,4.

Each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(δ_l).

Compute each:

l=0: (1)/(2k) * sin(90°)
sin(90°)=1. So term1 = 1/(2k) *1 = 1/(2k).

l=1: (3)/(2k) * sin(67°)
sin(67) is approx 0.9205.

l=2: (5)/(2k) * sin(55)
sin(55) is approx 0.8192.

l=3: (7)/(2k) * sin(30)
sin(30)=0.5.

l=4: (9)/(2k) * sin(13)
sin(13) is approx 0.22495.

Now, sum all these terms and then multiply by (2l+1)/(2k).

Wait, but wait, the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, for l=0 to L, where L is the maximum l considered.

So let me compute each (2l+1)*sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2:5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:7 * 0.5 =3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum these: 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

So sum is approximately 13.38205.

Then, multiply by 1/(2k), because the overall factor is (sum) * 1/(2k).

So (13.38205) * (1/(2k)) = 13.38205/(2k).

But k is 2.534e13 m⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.534e13) ) = 1/(5.068e13) ) ≈1.973e-14.

So 13.38205 * 1.973e-14 ≈ 13.38205 * 1.973e-14 ≈ let's compute that.

13 * 2e-14 is 2.6e-13, but precise calculation:

13.38205 * 1.973e-14 = approx 13.38205 * 1.973 = let's compute 13 *1.973=25.649, 0.38205 *1.973≈0.753. So total ≈25.649 +0.753=26.402 → 26.402e-14 = 2.6402e-13.

Wait, but wait, 13.382 * 1.973 is about (13 *1.973 + 0.382 *1.973). 13*1.973=25.649, 0.382*1.973≈0.753. Sum ≈26.402.

So 26.402e-14 = 2.6402e-13.

But wait, this is in units of (fm⁻¹) because k is in m⁻¹, and 1/(2k) would be in m. But wait, no, let's think about units. Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length (in fm, perhaps). So the imaginary part of f is in fm.

Wait, because the amplitude f is in units of length, so the imaginary part should be in length as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a value in 1/m, which is inverse meters. So I need to convert that into fermi, which is 1e-15 meters.

So 2.6402e-13 m⁻¹ is equivalent to 2.6402e-13 / (1e-15 m⁻¹) ) → because 1 m⁻¹ = 1e15 fm⁻¹. Wait, no, wait: 1 m⁻¹ = (1 m)^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 = 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So to convert from m⁻¹ to fm⁻¹, multiply by 1e15.

Wait, but wait, 2.6402e-13 m⁻¹ is the same as 2.6402e-13 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 2.6402e2 fm⁻¹ → 264.02 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, that's the imaginary part of f? Oh, no, wait, no. Because the formula is (sum terms) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, 1/(2k) = 1.973e-14 m⁻¹.

Wait, 1.973e-14 m⁻¹ = 1.973e-14 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ → 19.73 fm⁻¹.

Wait, wait, 1e15 fm = 1 m, so 1 m⁻¹ = 1e15 fm⁻¹.

So 1.973e-14 m⁻¹ = 1.973e-14 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 19.73 fm⁻¹.

So 13.38205 * (19.73 fm⁻¹) = 13.38205 *19.73 ≈ ?

Let me compute 13 *19.73 = 256.49. 0.38205 *19.73 ≈7.53. So total ≈256.49 +7.53 =264.02 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that's the sum of all terms, so the imaginary part of f is 264.02 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, none of these match 264. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Perhaps I messed up the formula. Wait, the imaginary part of the amplitude is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but wait, in some references, the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ,φ)= sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ) / ( 1 + ... ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the total cross-section, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by Im f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, no, perhaps the general formula is f = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

So, the imaginary part of f is sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). So at θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so Im f = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) sin δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier. So the calculation is correct?

Wait, but when I compute Im f, it's 264.02 fm⁻¹. But the options are in the hundreds of fm, except option A which is in the ten thousands.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the value of k. Let me check that again.

E = 50 MeV. So E = 50e6 eV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ c = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 3.1637e-26 J·m.

So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13) / (3.1637e-26) ) ≈2.533e13 m⁻¹.

So 2.533e13 m⁻¹ is 2.533e13 / (1e15) fm⁻¹ = 0.02533 fm⁻¹.

Wait, no, wait, 1 m⁻¹ is 1e-15 fm⁻¹. So 2.533e13 m⁻¹ equals 2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ = 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹) )? Wait, no, because k is in m⁻¹. Let me think.

Wait, 1 m is 1e15 fm, so 1 m⁻¹ is 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So, k =2.533e13 m⁻¹ →k=2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ → 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹) ) = 1/(5.066e-2 fm⁻¹) ) = (1 /5.066e-2) ) * fm.

Because 1/(fm⁻¹) is fm. So 1/(5.066e-2 ) ≈19.74 fm.

So 1/(2k) ≈19.74 fm.

So each term is (2l+1) * sin δ_l * (1/(2k)).

So the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.38205 as before. So 13.38205 * 19.74 fm ≈ 264.0 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Closest is option D: 251.271 fm. Hmm.

Ah, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l. Let me recheck.

l=0: (1) * sin90=1 → term 1.

l=1:3 * sin67. What's sin67° exactly? Let me compute more accurately.

sin(67°) = sin(1.16937 radians) = approximately 0.920505.

So 3*0.920505 = 2.761515.

l=2:5*sin55. sin55≈0.819152 →5 *0.819152=4.09576.

l=3:7*sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin13. sin13≈0.224951 →9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

Sum all these: 1 +2.761515=3.761515 +4.09576=7.857275 +3.5=11.357275 +2.02456=13.381835.

So about 13.381835.

So 13.381835 * 19.74 ≈ let's compute.

13 *19.74 = 256.62.

0.381835 *19.74 →approx 0.38 *19.74 ≈7.5012.

So total about 256.62 +7.5012=264.1212 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula uses the absolute value of the scattering amplitude. Or perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, I think I might have missed a factor of 2. Let me reevaluate. Wait, the general formula for the scattering amplitude is f = sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) * e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * P_l(cosθ) ].

So the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) * sin δ_l * P_l(cosθ) ].

At θ=0°, P_l(1)=1 for all l. So the sum is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, but in our calculation, the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/(2k)).

So the imaginary part is [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2k)).

Wait, but wait, 1/(2k) is 19.74 fm (from earlier calculation). So sum is 13.3818 *19.74 fm ≈264.12 fm.

But options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula for k is different. Maybe k is sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but that's non-relativistic. But E is way higher than m_e c², so relativistic approach is better.

Wait, let me think again about k. E=50 MeV =50e6 eV. The rest mass of electron is 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is way higher. So E ≈ pc → p = E/(c). Then, ħk = p → k = p/(ħ) = E/(ħ c).

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, let me compute E/(ħ c) precisely.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E=50e6 *1.602e-19 =8.01e-13 J.

ħ c =1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s =3.1637e-26 J·m.

So E/(ħ c)=8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26 ≈2.533e13 m⁻¹.

Which is 2.533e13 m⁻¹ =2.533e13 / (1e15) fm⁻¹ = 0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 * 0.02533 fm⁻¹ ) ) =1/(0.05066 fm⁻¹ )= 19.74 fm.

Wait, that's correct.

Hmm. So maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, perhaps using the optical theorem or considering the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is (4π/k²) Im f(0), where f(0) is the scattering amplitude at θ=0. But wait, I'm not sure. The optical theorem says σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0), but wait, I might have to double-check.

Wait, the optical theorem is: σ_total = (4π/k) Im [f(0,0)].

So if I can compute σ_total and then find Im f(0), perhaps that would help. But I don't have σ_total provided in the question. So this approach might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximation. For example, considering only the dominant term, perhaps l=0.

Wait, but when l=0, the term would be (1/(2k)) *1, which is 19.74 fm. Which isn't any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, like taking the phase shifts as giving the scattering amplitude as a sum of terms, each contributing to the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the first phase shift, l=0, which is 90°, and so Im f is (1/(2k)) *1. Which would be 19.74 fm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, but the options B, C, D are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, maybe the phase shifts are in radians? No, the question states degrees.

Wait, but when I used sin(67 degrees), but perhaps it was in radians. Let me check.

Wait, 67 degrees is about 1.169 radians. So sin(1.169 radians) is approximately 0.9205, which is what I used. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the sum in a different way. Let me compute each term again.

Sum = 1*(1) +3*(sin67°) +5*(sin55°) +7*(sin30°) +9*(sin13°).

Which is 1 +3*(0.9205) +5*(0.8192) +7*(0.5) +9*(0.22495).

Compute each term:

3 *0.9205=2.7615.

5*0.8192=4.096.

7*0.5=3.5.

9*0.22495= 2.02455.

So sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

So same as before. So the sum is 13.38205.

Hmm. Then, (1/(2k)) =19.74 fm.

So 13.38205 *19.74 ≈ 264.12 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, another thought: The formula for the scattering amplitude may include a factor of (2l +1) multiplied by (something else). Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is given as f = sum [ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ] / (k).

In that case, the imaginary part would be sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ] / k.

Which would change the calculation. Let me see.

So Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) /k.

So in this case, sum is 13.38205, k=2.533e13 m⁻¹.

So 13.38205 / (2.533e13 m⁻¹) )= 5.283e-13 m.

But 1 m =1e15 fm, so 5.283e-13 m =5.283e-13 *1e15 fm =528.3 fm.

Hmm, 528 is not one of the options either. Closest is option B: 355.351 fm. Not exactly matching.

But perhaps I should reevaluate the formula again.

Wait, another point: The scattering amplitude f is given in some references as:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Another source says:

f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) )

Which is what I used earlier. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different definition, like the scattering amplitude in terms of the partial waves without the 1/(2k) factor. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ].

In that case, the imaginary part would be sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ].

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So that would be 13.38205, which is unitless? No, because the amplitude should have units of length.

Wait, but then perhaps that sum is multiplied by some factor to get the amplitude in fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would make units of 1/(m) * (sum) → 1/m. To get fm, multiply by 1e15 m.

So (1/k) * sum * 1e15 m = (sum) * 1e15 /k.

Wait, let me compute this.

sum=13.38205.

k=2.533e13 m⁻¹ → 1/k=3.95e-14 m.

Multiply by 1e15 m⁻¹ → 3.95e-14 *1e15 = 395 m.

Wait, that's 395 meters, which is way too big.

No, that approach can't be right.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake in the initial approach?

Wait, another thought: The phase shifts given are for the partial waves, but perhaps the question is referring to the total cross-section.

Wait, the total cross-section σ_total is given by 4π/k² ∫ |f|² dΩ, but that might not directly help here.

Alternatively, the optical theorem says σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0,0), where f(0,0) is the scattering amplitude at θ=0, φ=0.

If I compute σ_total, perhaps I can find Im f(0,0).

But I don't have σ_total given here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the first few terms, but I summed all up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

My calculation was approximately 264.12 fm, which is closest to option D: 251.271 fm, but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k.

Wait, let me recalculate k in terms of inverse fermi.

k=2.533e13 m⁻¹.

1 m = 1e15 fm →1 m⁻¹ = 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So 2.533e13 m⁻¹ =2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ =2.533e-2 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 * 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹ ) = 1/(5.066e-2 fm⁻¹ )= (1/5.066e-2) fm → approximately 19.74 fm.

So 1/(2k) =19.74 fm.

So sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.38205.

So Im f =13.38205 *19.74 fm ≈264.12 fm.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k) * (1/(2)).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/k).

Which would be 13.38205 * (1/(2.533e-2 fm⁻¹)) ).

Wait, 1/(2.533e-2 fm⁻¹) )= 39.51 fm.

So 13.38205 *39.51 ≈528.3 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum multiplied by (1/(2k)) * (1e15 fm), because k is in m⁻¹, and 1e15 fm =1 m.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think: 1 m⁻¹ is 1e15 fm⁻¹ → 1/(2k) in m⁻¹ is 1/(2k) =19.74 fm.

So, 19.74 fm.

Hmm. Wait, is there any chance that the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm, and perhaps my approximation for sin values is a bit off? Let me recompute the sum with more precise sine values.

Compute each (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin(90) =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°) → sin67= approx 0.92050485345.

So 3 *0.92050485345=2.76151456.

l=2:5* sin55 → sin55=0.81915204428.

5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

l=3:7 * sin30=3.5.

l=4:9* sin13 → sin13°=0.2249510543.

9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Now sum these:

1 +2.76151456=3.76151456.

+4.0957602214=7.8572747814.

+3.5=11.3572747814.

+2.0245594887=13.3818342701.

So sum=13.3818342701.

Multiply by 19.74 fm:

13.3818342701 *19.74 ≈ 264.0 fm.

Still doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should have converted them to radians for calculation. Let me check.

No, because the sine function in programming languages usually expects radians, but in this case, since I'm using approximate values, perhaps converting the angles to radians would give slightly different sine values.

Let me compute the sine of each δ_l in radians:

δ_0=90°=pi/2 → sin(pi/2)=1.0.

δ_1=67° →67 * pi/180 ≈1.16937 radians →sin≈0.9205.

δ_2=55° →55 *pi/180≈0.95993 radians →sin≈0.8192.

δ_3=30° →pi/6 →0.523599 radians →sin=0.5.

δ_4=13° →13 * pi/180≈0.22689 radians →sin≈0.22495.

So the same as before. So no change.

Hmm. I'm not sure why my calculation doesn't match the options. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l+1) multiplied by (1/(2k)) multiplied by sin δ_l, but without multiplying all terms by (1/(2k)).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each term in the sum has the same (1/(2k)) factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition for the scattering amplitude, perhaps including an extra factor of 1/2 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/(k) ), not (1/(2k)).

So, 1/k = 1/(2.533e13 m⁻¹) )=3.95e-14 m.

But 1 m =1e15 fm →3.95e-14 m =3.95e-14 *1e15 fm=395 fm.

So sum is 13.381834 *395 fm =5283.3 fm. No, that's way higher than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula for f. Another source says:

The scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

The imaginary part would then be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Which is the same as before. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So if my calculation gives 264.12 fm, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is option D: 251.271 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, another possibility: The phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should use them in radians when calculating the sine. Let me compute the sum with precise sine values in radians.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(pi/2) =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°) →67°=1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937) = approx 0.92050485345 →3 *0.92050485345=2.76151456035.

l=2:5 * sin(55°) →55°=0.95993 radians.

sin(0.95993)=approx 0.81915204428 →5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

l=3:7 * sin(30°)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°) →13°=0.22689 radians.

sin(0.22689)=approx 0.2249510543 →9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Sum remains 1 +2.76151456035=3.76151456035 → +4.0957602214=7.85727478175 →+3.5=11.35727478175 →+2.0245594887=13.38183427045.

Same as before. So Im f is 13.38183427045 *19.74 fm ≈264.0 fm.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I'm supposed to choose the closest option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, let me think again about the unit conversion for k.

Wait, k= E/(ħ c) → E=50 MeV, which is 50e6 *1.602e-13 J? Wait, no, 1 eV=1.602e-19 J →50 MeV=50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

So E=8.01e-13 J.

ħ c= 1.0545718e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s=3.1637e-26 J·m.

So k=8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26 = 2.533e13 m⁻¹.

Which is 2.533e13 m⁻¹ →2.533e13 / (1e15) fm⁻¹=0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k)=1/(2 *0.02533 fm⁻¹ )=1/(0.05066 fm⁻¹ )=19.74 fm.

So sum is 13.381834 *19.74=264.0 fm.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is 264.0 fm, but it's not listed. So perhaps the closest is option D:251.271 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should have converted them to radians before taking the sine. Let me compute the sines using radians.

Wait, δ_0=90°=pi/2 → sin(pi/2)=1.

δ_1=67°=1.16937 radians → sin=approx 0.92050485345.

δ_2=55°=0.95993 radians → sin=approx0.81915204428.

δ_3=30°=pi/6 →0.5.

δ_4=13°=0.22689 radians →sin=approx0.2249510543.

So sum is same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k) * (1/2) )

Which would be sum * (1/(2k)).

Which is exactly what I've computed as 264.0 fm.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended answer is option D: 251.271 fm, which is close but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the value of k to be computed differently, such as using non-relativistic energy.

Wait, non-relativistic case: E=pc → p= sqrt(2mE). So k=p/(ħ) = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ).

m_e c²=0.511 MeV, so E=50 MeV >> m_e c² → relativistic, so non-relativistic approach not valid.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll go with my calculation of approximately 264.0 fm, but since it's not an option, I'll reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the sum as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k)) * (1e15 fm) ?

Wait, no, because 1/(2k) is already in fm.

Wait, perhaps the units are wrong. Let me think: k is in m⁻¹. 1/(2k) is in m.

But 1 m =1e15 fm, so 1/(2k) in m is 19.74 fm.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. So I'll conclude that the correct answer is approximately 264 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im } f = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) \sin \delta_l,
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts. The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and the energy of the electrons is \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the energy \( E \) by:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}.
\]

Given \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} = 8.01 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \), and using \( \hbar c = 3.1637 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J·m} \), we find:

\[
k = \frac{8.01 \times 10^{-13}}{3.1637 \times 10^{-26}} \approx 2.533 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Converting \( k \) to inverse femtometers (\( \text{fm}^{-1} \)):

\[
k = 2.533 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1} \times 10^{-15} \, \text{fm}^{-1} = 0.02533 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{2k} = \frac{1}{2 \times 0.02533} \approx 19.74 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum (2l+1) \sin \delta_l \)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude depends on the sum:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l.
\]

Using the given phase shifts and their sines:

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2(0)+1) \sin 90^\circ = 1 \times 1 = 1 \),
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2(1)+1) \sin 67^\circ = 3 \times 0.9205 \approx 2.7615 \),
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2(2)+1) \sin 55^\circ = 5 \times 0.8192 \approx 4.096 \),
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2(3)+1) \sin 30^\circ = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \),
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2(4)+1) \sin 13^\circ = 9 \times 0.22495 \approx 2.0246 \).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.0246 \approx 13.382.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \text{Im } f \)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im } f = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l = 19.74 \times 13.382 \approx 264.1 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f \approx 264.1 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is:

**D) 251.271 fm.**

### Conclusion
While the calculated value is slightly higher than option D, it is the closest match among the given choices. Minor discrepancies may arise due to approximations in intermediate steps or differences in interpretation.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, elastic scattering... right, that's when the incident particles (like electrons) collide with target particles (maybe nucleons in the nucleus) and then scatter off without changing their energy. Phase shifts are involved in the scattering amplitude, I remember that from quantum mechanics.

The problem gives me several phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and tells me to ignore the rest. So these are the first five phase shifts, I guess up to l=4 because the index starts at 0.

The formula for the scattering amplitude, I think it's something like f(θ) being a sum over these phase shifts. The imaginary part of the amplitude is given by a specific expression. Wait, the imaginary part is tied to the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem comes into play here, but maybe I don't need that right now.

I remember the formula for the total scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) in terms of partial waves. Along the beam direction, which would be θ=0°, right? So the direction where the particle comes in along the beam axis. So the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 would depend on the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by certain factors.

Wait, the general expression for the scattering amplitude f is f = sum over l of ( (2l +1)/ (2k) ) * ( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since we're looking for the imaginary part along the beam direction, θ=0. So cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(x)=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. Wait, no—wait, the Legendre polynomials at x=1 are all 1? No, I think P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)= (3*(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. Hmm, actually, for even l, P_l(1)=1, but for odd l, like l=3, P_3(1)=1 as well. Wait, let me think. P_l(1) is 1 for all l because P_l(1)=1. Yeah, because the generating function at x=1 gives all P_l(1)=1. So that's helpful.

So when θ=0, the sum reduces to just summing terms without any angular dependence beyond the phase shifts. So the imaginary part of f would be the sum over l of ( (2l +1)/(2k) ) * sin(δ_l), because e^{iδ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so the imaginary part is sin δ_l.

Wait, but the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So, I'm summing over l=0 to 4. Each term is (2l +1)/(2k) multiplied by sin(δ_l).

But wait, what is k? The wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to find k in terms of their momentum. Electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e, so non-relativistic approximations might not hold. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic expression for k.

The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE) when E is much larger than m, but wait, relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So for high energy, E ≈ pc. So then k = p/(ħ) = E/(ħ c) * (c / ħ) ? Wait, no. Let me think about units. Planck constant ħ has units of J·s. The wave number k is in 1/m. So, from E = ħ c k, because for a free particle, E = ħ ω and ω = c k. So, k = E/(ħ c). 

Wait, E is given in MeV. Let me convert that to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 50 MeV is 50e6 eV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s. So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) = calculate denominator: 1.0545718e-34 *3e8 ≈3.1637e-26. So 8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 ≈ approx 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, but that seems really high. Did I do that right? Let me double-check. Oh, wait, E is 50 MeV, which is about 50 million eV. Let me make sure about the conversion.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 50 MeV is 50,000,000 eV. So 50,000,000 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-12 J? Wait wait, no: 10^6 eV is a MeV. So 50e6 eV is 50 MeV. So 50e6 *1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J, which is what I had before. So yes, k is 8.01e-13 / (1.0545718e-34 *3e8) = 8.01e-13 / (3.1637e-26) ) ≈ approx 2.53e13 m⁻¹.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a simpler way. Oh, because the options are given in fermi (fm), which is 1e-15 meters. So perhaps I can find k in inverse fermis.

Let me think, 1 m = 1e15 fm. So 1 m⁻¹ is 1e-15 fm⁻¹. So if k is 2.53e13 m⁻¹, that's 2.53e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ = 2.53e-2 fm⁻¹. Hmm, that's about 0.0253 fm⁻¹. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute k. E is 50 MeV.

E (Joules) = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) ) = 8.01e-13 / (3.1637e-26) ) → approx 2.53e13 m⁻¹.

So 2.53e13 m⁻¹ is 2.53e13 / (1e15 fm) ) → 2.53e-2 fm⁻¹. So ≈ 0.0253 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ. Wait, but that's for non-relativistic case. Hmm, but since the energy is 50 MeV, which is way above the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV), the energy is highly relativistic. So E = pc, so p = E/(c). Then, ħ k = p → k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c). Which is what I used earlier. So that's correct.

So k = 2.53e13 m⁻¹, which is 0.0253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate the denominator: ħ c = 1.0545718e-34 * 3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J·m. So E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13 J) / (3.1637e-26 J·m) ) = 8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26 = approximately 2.534e13 m⁻¹.

So 2.534e13 m⁻¹ = 2.534e13 * (1e-15 m)⁻¹ → wait, no, 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1 m⁻¹ = 1e-15 fm⁻¹. So 2.534e13 m⁻¹ is 2.534e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ = 2.534e-2 fm⁻¹.

Wait, 2.534e-2 is 0.02534 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, okay, but maybe I can calculate it as 2.53e-2 fm⁻¹.

Now, the sum for the imaginary part of f is sum_{l=0 to 4} [ (2l +1) / (2k) ) * sin(δ_l) ].

So let me compute each term. The sum is from l=0 to 4. l=0,1,2,3,4.

Each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(δ_l).

Compute each:

l=0: (1)/(2k) * sin(90°)
sin(90°)=1. So term1 = 1/(2k) *1 = 1/(2k).

l=1: (3)/(2k) * sin(67°)
sin(67) is approx 0.9205.

l=2: (5)/(2k) * sin(55)
sin(55) is approx 0.8192.

l=3: (7)/(2k) * sin(30)
sin(30)=0.5.

l=4: (9)/(2k) * sin(13)
sin(13) is approx 0.22495.

Now, sum all these terms and then multiply by (2l+1)/(2k).

Wait, but wait, the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, for l=0 to L, where L is the maximum l considered.

So let me compute each (2l+1)*sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1: 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2:5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:7 * 0.5 =3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum these: 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

So sum is approximately 13.38205.

Then, multiply by 1/(2k), because the overall factor is (sum) * 1/(2k).

So (13.38205) * (1/(2k)) = 13.38205/(2k).

But k is 2.534e13 m⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.534e13) ) = 1/(5.068e13) ) ≈1.973e-14.

So 13.38205 * 1.973e-14 ≈ 13.38205 * 1.973e-14 ≈ let's compute that.

13 * 2e-14 is 2.6e-13, but precise calculation:

13.38205 * 1.973e-14 = approx 13.38205 * 1.973 = let's compute 13 *1.973=25.649, 0.38205 *1.973≈0.753. So total ≈25.649 +0.753=26.402 → 26.402e-14 = 2.6402e-13.

Wait, but wait, 13.382 * 1.973 is about (13 *1.973 + 0.382 *1.973). 13*1.973=25.649, 0.382*1.973≈0.753. Sum ≈26.402.

So 26.402e-14 = 2.6402e-13.

But wait, this is in units of (fm⁻¹) because k is in m⁻¹, and 1/(2k) would be in m. But wait, no, let's think about units. Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length (in fm, perhaps). So the imaginary part of f is in fm.

Wait, because the amplitude f is in units of length, so the imaginary part should be in length as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a value in 1/m, which is inverse meters. So I need to convert that into fermi, which is 1e-15 meters.

So 2.6402e-13 m⁻¹ is equivalent to 2.6402e-13 / (1e-15 m⁻¹) ) → because 1 m⁻¹ = 1e15 fm⁻¹. Wait, no, wait: 1 m⁻¹ = (1 m)^-1 = (1e15 fm)^-1 = 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So to convert from m⁻¹ to fm⁻¹, multiply by 1e15.

Wait, but wait, 2.6402e-13 m⁻¹ is the same as 2.6402e-13 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 2.6402e2 fm⁻¹ → 264.02 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, that's the imaginary part of f? Oh, no, wait, no. Because the formula is (sum terms) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, 1/(2k) = 1.973e-14 m⁻¹.

Wait, 1.973e-14 m⁻¹ = 1.973e-14 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ → 19.73 fm⁻¹.

Wait, wait, 1e15 fm = 1 m, so 1 m⁻¹ = 1e15 fm⁻¹.

So 1.973e-14 m⁻¹ = 1.973e-14 * 1e15 fm⁻¹ = 19.73 fm⁻¹.

So 13.38205 * (19.73 fm⁻¹) = 13.38205 *19.73 ≈ ?

Let me compute 13 *19.73 = 256.49. 0.38205 *19.73 ≈7.53. So total ≈256.49 +7.53 =264.02 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that's the sum of all terms, so the imaginary part of f is 264.02 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, none of these match 264. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Perhaps I messed up the formula. Wait, the imaginary part of the amplitude is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but wait, in some references, the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ,φ)= sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ) / ( 1 + ... ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the total cross-section, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is given by Im f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, no, perhaps the general formula is f = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

So, the imaginary part of f is sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). So at θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so Im f = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) sin δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier. So the calculation is correct?

Wait, but when I compute Im f, it's 264.02 fm⁻¹. But the options are in the hundreds of fm, except option A which is in the ten thousands.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the value of k. Let me check that again.

E = 50 MeV. So E = 50e6 eV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

ħ c = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 3.1637e-26 J·m.

So k = E/(ħ c) = (8.01e-13) / (3.1637e-26) ) ≈2.533e13 m⁻¹.

So 2.533e13 m⁻¹ is 2.533e13 / (1e15) fm⁻¹ = 0.02533 fm⁻¹.

Wait, no, wait, 1 m⁻¹ is 1e-15 fm⁻¹. So 2.533e13 m⁻¹ equals 2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ = 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹) )? Wait, no, because k is in m⁻¹. Let me think.

Wait, 1 m is 1e15 fm, so 1 m⁻¹ is 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So, k =2.533e13 m⁻¹ →k=2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ → 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹) ) = 1/(5.066e-2 fm⁻¹) ) = (1 /5.066e-2) ) * fm.

Because 1/(fm⁻¹) is fm. So 1/(5.066e-2 ) ≈19.74 fm.

So 1/(2k) ≈19.74 fm.

So each term is (2l+1) * sin δ_l * (1/(2k)).

So the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.38205 as before. So 13.38205 * 19.74 fm ≈ 264.0 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Closest is option D: 251.271 fm. Hmm.

Ah, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l. Let me recheck.

l=0: (1) * sin90=1 → term 1.

l=1:3 * sin67. What's sin67° exactly? Let me compute more accurately.

sin(67°) = sin(1.16937 radians) = approximately 0.920505.

So 3*0.920505 = 2.761515.

l=2:5*sin55. sin55≈0.819152 →5 *0.819152=4.09576.

l=3:7*sin30=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin13. sin13≈0.224951 →9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

Sum all these: 1 +2.761515=3.761515 +4.09576=7.857275 +3.5=11.357275 +2.02456=13.381835.

So about 13.381835.

So 13.381835 * 19.74 ≈ let's compute.

13 *19.74 = 256.62.

0.381835 *19.74 →approx 0.38 *19.74 ≈7.5012.

So total about 256.62 +7.5012=264.1212 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula uses the absolute value of the scattering amplitude. Or perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, I think I might have missed a factor of 2. Let me reevaluate. Wait, the general formula for the scattering amplitude is f = sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) * e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * P_l(cosθ) ].

So the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) * sin δ_l * P_l(cosθ) ].

At θ=0°, P_l(1)=1 for all l. So the sum is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, but in our calculation, the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/(2k)).

So the imaginary part is [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/(2k)).

Wait, but wait, 1/(2k) is 19.74 fm (from earlier calculation). So sum is 13.3818 *19.74 fm ≈264.12 fm.

But options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula for k is different. Maybe k is sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but that's non-relativistic. But E is way higher than m_e c², so relativistic approach is better.

Wait, let me think again about k. E=50 MeV =50e6 eV. The rest mass of electron is 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is way higher. So E ≈ pc → p = E/(c). Then, ħk = p → k = p/(ħ) = E/(ħ c).

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, let me compute E/(ħ c) precisely.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E=50e6 *1.602e-19 =8.01e-13 J.

ħ c =1.0545718e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s =3.1637e-26 J·m.

So E/(ħ c)=8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26 ≈2.533e13 m⁻¹.

Which is 2.533e13 m⁻¹ =2.533e13 / (1e15) fm⁻¹ = 0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 * 0.02533 fm⁻¹ ) ) =1/(0.05066 fm⁻¹ )= 19.74 fm.

Wait, that's correct.

Hmm. So maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, perhaps using the optical theorem or considering the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is (4π/k²) Im f(0), where f(0) is the scattering amplitude at θ=0. But wait, I'm not sure. The optical theorem says σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0), but wait, I might have to double-check.

Wait, the optical theorem is: σ_total = (4π/k) Im [f(0,0)].

So if I can compute σ_total and then find Im f(0), perhaps that would help. But I don't have σ_total provided in the question. So this approach might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximation. For example, considering only the dominant term, perhaps l=0.

Wait, but when l=0, the term would be (1/(2k)) *1, which is 19.74 fm. Which isn't any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, like taking the phase shifts as giving the scattering amplitude as a sum of terms, each contributing to the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the first phase shift, l=0, which is 90°, and so Im f is (1/(2k)) *1. Which would be 19.74 fm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, but the options B, C, D are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, maybe the phase shifts are in radians? No, the question states degrees.

Wait, but when I used sin(67 degrees), but perhaps it was in radians. Let me check.

Wait, 67 degrees is about 1.169 radians. So sin(1.169 radians) is approximately 0.9205, which is what I used. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the sum in a different way. Let me compute each term again.

Sum = 1*(1) +3*(sin67°) +5*(sin55°) +7*(sin30°) +9*(sin13°).

Which is 1 +3*(0.9205) +5*(0.8192) +7*(0.5) +9*(0.22495).

Compute each term:

3 *0.9205=2.7615.

5*0.8192=4.096.

7*0.5=3.5.

9*0.22495= 2.02455.

So sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

So same as before. So the sum is 13.38205.

Hmm. Then, (1/(2k)) =19.74 fm.

So 13.38205 *19.74 ≈ 264.12 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, another thought: The formula for the scattering amplitude may include a factor of (2l +1) multiplied by (something else). Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is given as f = sum [ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ] / (k).

In that case, the imaginary part would be sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ] / k.

Which would change the calculation. Let me see.

So Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) /k.

So in this case, sum is 13.38205, k=2.533e13 m⁻¹.

So 13.38205 / (2.533e13 m⁻¹) )= 5.283e-13 m.

But 1 m =1e15 fm, so 5.283e-13 m =5.283e-13 *1e15 fm =528.3 fm.

Hmm, 528 is not one of the options either. Closest is option B: 355.351 fm. Not exactly matching.

But perhaps I should reevaluate the formula again.

Wait, another point: The scattering amplitude f is given in some references as:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Another source says:

f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) )

Which is what I used earlier. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different definition, like the scattering amplitude in terms of the partial waves without the 1/(2k) factor. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ].

In that case, the imaginary part would be sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ].

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So that would be 13.38205, which is unitless? No, because the amplitude should have units of length.

Wait, but then perhaps that sum is multiplied by some factor to get the amplitude in fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would make units of 1/(m) * (sum) → 1/m. To get fm, multiply by 1e15 m.

So (1/k) * sum * 1e15 m = (sum) * 1e15 /k.

Wait, let me compute this.

sum=13.38205.

k=2.533e13 m⁻¹ → 1/k=3.95e-14 m.

Multiply by 1e15 m⁻¹ → 3.95e-14 *1e15 = 395 m.

Wait, that's 395 meters, which is way too big.

No, that approach can't be right.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake in the initial approach?

Wait, another thought: The phase shifts given are for the partial waves, but perhaps the question is referring to the total cross-section.

Wait, the total cross-section σ_total is given by 4π/k² ∫ |f|² dΩ, but that might not directly help here.

Alternatively, the optical theorem says σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0,0), where f(0,0) is the scattering amplitude at θ=0, φ=0.

If I compute σ_total, perhaps I can find Im f(0,0).

But I don't have σ_total given here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the first few terms, but I summed all up to l=4.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

My calculation was approximately 264.12 fm, which is closest to option D: 251.271 fm, but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for k.

Wait, let me recalculate k in terms of inverse fermi.

k=2.533e13 m⁻¹.

1 m = 1e15 fm →1 m⁻¹ = 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So 2.533e13 m⁻¹ =2.533e13 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ =2.533e-2 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k) =1/(2 * 2.533e-2 fm⁻¹ ) = 1/(5.066e-2 fm⁻¹ )= (1/5.066e-2) fm → approximately 19.74 fm.

So 1/(2k) =19.74 fm.

So sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.38205.

So Im f =13.38205 *19.74 fm ≈264.12 fm.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k) * (1/(2)).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] * (1/k).

Which would be 13.38205 * (1/(2.533e-2 fm⁻¹)) ).

Wait, 1/(2.533e-2 fm⁻¹) )= 39.51 fm.

So 13.38205 *39.51 ≈528.3 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum multiplied by (1/(2k)) * (1e15 fm), because k is in m⁻¹, and 1e15 fm =1 m.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think: 1 m⁻¹ is 1e15 fm⁻¹ → 1/(2k) in m⁻¹ is 1/(2k) =19.74 fm.

So, 19.74 fm.

Hmm. Wait, is there any chance that the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm, and perhaps my approximation for sin values is a bit off? Let me recompute the sum with more precise sine values.

Compute each (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin(90) =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°) → sin67= approx 0.92050485345.

So 3 *0.92050485345=2.76151456.

l=2:5* sin55 → sin55=0.81915204428.

5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

l=3:7 * sin30=3.5.

l=4:9* sin13 → sin13°=0.2249510543.

9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Now sum these:

1 +2.76151456=3.76151456.

+4.0957602214=7.8572747814.

+3.5=11.3572747814.

+2.0245594887=13.3818342701.

So sum=13.3818342701.

Multiply by 19.74 fm:

13.3818342701 *19.74 ≈ 264.0 fm.

Still doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should have converted them to radians for calculation. Let me check.

No, because the sine function in programming languages usually expects radians, but in this case, since I'm using approximate values, perhaps converting the angles to radians would give slightly different sine values.

Let me compute the sine of each δ_l in radians:

δ_0=90°=pi/2 → sin(pi/2)=1.0.

δ_1=67° →67 * pi/180 ≈1.16937 radians →sin≈0.9205.

δ_2=55° →55 *pi/180≈0.95993 radians →sin≈0.8192.

δ_3=30° →pi/6 →0.523599 radians →sin=0.5.

δ_4=13° →13 * pi/180≈0.22689 radians →sin≈0.22495.

So the same as before. So no change.

Hmm. I'm not sure why my calculation doesn't match the options. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l+1) multiplied by (1/(2k)) multiplied by sin δ_l, but without multiplying all terms by (1/(2k)).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each term in the sum has the same (1/(2k)) factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition for the scattering amplitude, perhaps including an extra factor of 1/2 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (1/(k) ), not (1/(2k)).

So, 1/k = 1/(2.533e13 m⁻¹) )=3.95e-14 m.

But 1 m =1e15 fm →3.95e-14 m =3.95e-14 *1e15 fm=395 fm.

So sum is 13.381834 *395 fm =5283.3 fm. No, that's way higher than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula for f. Another source says:

The scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

The imaginary part would then be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Which is the same as before. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So if my calculation gives 264.12 fm, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is option D: 251.271 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, another possibility: The phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should use them in radians when calculating the sine. Let me compute the sum with precise sine values in radians.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(pi/2) =1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°) →67°=1.16937 radians.

sin(1.16937) = approx 0.92050485345 →3 *0.92050485345=2.76151456035.

l=2:5 * sin(55°) →55°=0.95993 radians.

sin(0.95993)=approx 0.81915204428 →5 *0.81915204428=4.0957602214.

l=3:7 * sin(30°)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°) →13°=0.22689 radians.

sin(0.22689)=approx 0.2249510543 →9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Sum remains 1 +2.76151456035=3.76151456035 → +4.0957602214=7.85727478175 →+3.5=11.35727478175 →+2.0245594887=13.38183427045.

Same as before. So Im f is 13.38183427045 *19.74 fm ≈264.0 fm.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I'm supposed to choose the closest option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, let me think again about the unit conversion for k.

Wait, k= E/(ħ c) → E=50 MeV, which is 50e6 *1.602e-13 J? Wait, no, 1 eV=1.602e-19 J →50 MeV=50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

So E=8.01e-13 J.

ħ c= 1.0545718e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s=3.1637e-26 J·m.

So k=8.01e-13 /3.1637e-26 = 2.533e13 m⁻¹.

Which is 2.533e13 m⁻¹ →2.533e13 / (1e15) fm⁻¹=0.02533 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k)=1/(2 *0.02533 fm⁻¹ )=1/(0.05066 fm⁻¹ )=19.74 fm.

So sum is 13.381834 *19.74=264.0 fm.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is 264.0 fm, but it's not listed. So perhaps the closest is option D:251.271 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should have converted them to radians before taking the sine. Let me compute the sines using radians.

Wait, δ_0=90°=pi/2 → sin(pi/2)=1.

δ_1=67°=1.16937 radians → sin=approx 0.92050485345.

δ_2=55°=0.95993 radians → sin=approx0.81915204428.

δ_3=30°=pi/6 →0.5.

δ_4=13°=0.22689 radians →sin=approx0.2249510543.

So sum is same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k) * (1/2) )

Which would be sum * (1/(2k)).

Which is exactly what I've computed as 264.0 fm.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended answer is option D: 251.271 fm, which is close but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the value of k to be computed differently, such as using non-relativistic energy.

Wait, non-relativistic case: E=pc → p= sqrt(2mE). So k=p/(ħ) = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ).

m_e c²=0.511 MeV, so E=50 MeV >> m_e c² → relativistic, so non-relativistic approach not valid.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll go with my calculation of approximately 264.0 fm, but since it's not an option, I'll reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the sum as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k)) * (1e15 fm) ?

Wait, no, because 1/(2k) is already in fm.

Wait, perhaps the units are wrong. Let me think: k is in m⁻¹. 1/(2k) is in m.

But 1 m =1e15 fm, so 1/(2k) in m is 19.74 fm.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. So I'll conclude that the correct answer is approximately 264 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im } f = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) \sin \delta_l,
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \delta_l \) are the phase shifts. The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and the energy of the electrons is \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the energy \( E \) by:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}.
\]

Given \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} = 8.01 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \), and using \( \hbar c = 3.1637 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J·m} \), we find:

\[
k = \frac{8.01 \times 10^{-13}}{3.1637 \times 10^{-26}} \approx 2.533 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Converting \( k \) to inverse femtometers (\( \text{fm}^{-1} \)):

\[
k = 2.533 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1} \times 10^{-15} \, \text{fm}^{-1} = 0.02533 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{2k} = \frac{1}{2 \times 0.02533} \approx 19.74 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum \( \sum (2l+1) \sin \delta_l \)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude depends on the sum:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l.
\]

Using the given phase shifts and their sines:

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2(0)+1) \sin 90^\circ = 1 \times 1 = 1 \),
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2(1)+1) \sin 67^\circ = 3 \times 0.9205 \approx 2.7615 \),
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2(2)+1) \sin 55^\circ = 5 \times 0.8192 \approx 4.096 \),
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2(3)+1) \sin 30^\circ = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \),
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2(4)+1) \sin 13^\circ = 9 \times 0.22495 \approx 2.0246 \).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.0246 \approx 13.382.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \text{Im } f \)
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:

\[
\text{Im } f = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l = 19.74 \times 13.382 \approx 264.1 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f \approx 264.1 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is:

**D) 251.271 fm.**

### Conclusion
While the calculated value is slightly higher than option D, it is the closest match among the given choices. Minor discrepancies may arise due to approximations in intermediate steps or differences in interpretation.
