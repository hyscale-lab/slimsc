Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energies, we usually use the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges.

Alright, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. But wait, wait—the problem says 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Interesting.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I think the energy here refers to the electric potential energy stored in the system because of the arrangement of these charges. Since potential energy is a scalar quantity, we can calculate the contributions from each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait—since the system is isolated and the charges are fixed except for the one at P? Or wait, the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same point 2m from P, so they're all equally distant from each other? Or are they arranged in a circle or something? The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they are all at the same distance from P but arranged in a sphere around P. That would mean each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but the distance between any two of them would be more complicated. Oh wait, but the problem says each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, but doesn't specify the distance between the other charges. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. 

Wait, but maybe when calculating the potential energy of the system, we only consider the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P, not between the 12 charges themselves. Because the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps that comes from considering just the interactions with the fixed charge. Or maybe the other interactions contribute as well.

Wait, no. Wait, the system's total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So, all possible pairs contribute: each of the 12 charges with the fixed one, and each pair among the 12.

But wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P, but what's the distance between any two of them? Hmm, I think the problem doesn't specify that, which complicates things. But maybe for the minimum energy, the charges are arranged such that each of them is as close as possible to each other, but I'm not sure. Wait, but if the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, they form a spherical shell around P. So the distance between any two of them would depend on their positions on the shell. The minimum possible potential energy would require the charges to be placed in such a way that the potential among themselves is minimized. But for identical charges (all positive, since each is 2e), the potential energy between them is repulsive. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy—wait, no, wait. Potential energy for like charges is positive, and since you have to do work to bring them together, the potential energy increases as they get closer. So to minimize the total potential energy, you would arrange them as far apart as possible, but in this case, since they're constrained to be at 2 m from P, their mutual distances can't be adjusted beyond that. Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, so the distance between any two charges is determined by the positions on the sphere. But calculating all the pairwise distances for 12 charges is complicated.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy of the interaction between each of the 12 charges and the 13th fixed charge. Because if the 12 charges are fixed in place, their mutual interactions may not contribute because their positions are fixed. Hmm, but the problem states it's an isolated system, so all interactions matter.

Wait, but maybe the problem is simplifying the scenario. Let's think about the formula for potential energy between two point charges: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (~8.988×10^9 N·m²/C²). 

So, the total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs. So, how many pairs are there?

We have 13 charges. The 13th is fixed. The other 12 are each at 2 m from the 13th. So, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th. That's 12 interactions. Additionally, each of the 12 charges interacts with the other 11, so that's (12*11)/2 = 66 interactions. But wait, the problem says that the 12 are constrained, so maybe their mutual distances can't be considered, or perhaps their mutual potential is negligible? Or maybe the problem is only considering the energy between the 12 and the 13th charge, not the mutual energy among the 12.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. If we ignore the mutual potential energies of the 12, then the energy would be lower. But I don't know if that's acceptable because the mutual potential energy is still part of the system's total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the 12 charges are all fixed at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are such that their interactions are all at a distance of 4 m from each other. But that's not necessarily correct because the charges could be placed anywhere on the sphere of radius 2 m, so their pairwise distances can vary between 0 and 4 m. However, the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but not necessarily where else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions of the 12 charges, considering that they are constrained and their positions are fixed, so their mutual potential energy is already accounted for in another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the 12 and the fixed charge at P.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So, perhaps the minimum occurs when all the 12 charges are as far as possible from each other to minimize their mutual repulsion, but that would lead to higher potential energy, not lower. Because higher separation reduces the mutual repulsion's potential energy (but for positive charges, the potential energy is positive and increases as they get closer). So arranging the charges as far apart as possible would minimize the mutual energy, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual interactions of the 12 are negligible or that the system's minimum energy arises from the interactions between the 12 and the fixed charge. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the problem again. Since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 m away, the potential energy contributed by each of the 12 charges is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/2m. Each pair between the 13th and the 12 contributes that. So, total from these interactions is 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2)].

But wait, what about the mutual interactions between the 12 charges? Each pair among the 12 contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r, where r is the distance between them. But if the 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two can be calculated. Let me see: the distance r between two points on a sphere of radius R is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. However, without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to calculate the exact sum of all these terms. But the problem states that this is the minimum energy, so perhaps the mutual interactions are to be considered, but that complicates things.

Wait, maybe the question is only considering the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, not their mutual interactions. Because the problem says that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, implying their positions are fixed relative to P, so their mutual distances are fixed as well. But without more details, perhaps the intended solution is to only consider the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual interactions are being ignored for simplicity, or perhaps the problem is structured such that the mutual interactions don't contribute because the charges are arranged in a way that they don't interact (unlikely, since they are all in space at 2m from P). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick one, and the mutual interactions cancel each other out. But no, each pair contributes a positive term to the potential energy because all are positive charges.

Wait, but considering the system's minimum energy, perhaps arranging the 12 charges in a way that their mutual potential energy is as small as possible. Since they are all positive, the minimum mutual potential energy occurs when they are as far apart as possible. So, if they are placed on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m, equally spaced, their mutual distances are maximized. But how much does that affect the total energy?

But the question is about the minimum energy. So, including all interactions, including the 12's mutual. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate only the interactions between the 12 and the fixed charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have only the interaction between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and it's up to the solver to ignore the mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated.

So, let me proceed under the assumption that the problem only considers the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge. Because that's the only information given, and the mutual distances between the 12 are not provided.

So, each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. The charge at P is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e.

So, the potential energy for each pair (13th and each of the 12) is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m).

Wait, let me compute that.

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / 2.

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy is 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2)).

Simplify: 12 * (2 k e²) = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait—what's the value of e? e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So, substituting the numbers:

k = 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute that.

First, compute (1.602e-19)^2: (1.602)^2 is about 2.566, so 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) x 10^(9-38) = approximately 23.0e-29.

Wait, let's compute 8.988 * 2.566:

8 * 2.566 is about 20.528, 0.988 * 2.566 is about 2.536. So total is around 23.064.

So, 23.064e-29.

Multiply by 24: 23.064e-29 * 24 = 553.536e-29 = 5.53536e-27 J.

Wait, but that's the energy if only considering the 12 interactions.

Wait, but if the mutual interactions are also considered, the energy would be higher. So, perhaps the problem wants us to include the mutual interactions.

But without knowing the exact distances, I can't compute the sum for all 66 pairs. Hmm. So perhaps the question is only considering the 12 interactions, so the answer would be approximately 5.535e-27 J. But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial formula:

Each pair contributes U = k * (2e)^2 / (2 m), because each of the 12 is 2 m from P.

Wait, no—each of the 12 charges (each 2e) is at distance 2 m from P (which has 2e). So the formula is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2) = k*(4e²)/2 = 2 k e² per pair.

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, that's correct.

Now, let's compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So, e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = (2.566e-38) C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38 = (23.06) * 1e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.306e-28 = 55.344e-28 = 5.5344e-27 J.

Hmm, so that's approximately 5.534e-27 J. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 7.056e-27, which is higher. None of the options exactly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each pair is counted twice? Wait, no, because in the system, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th once. So, 12 pairs, each contributing 2 k e², so 24 k e².

Wait, let me re-calculate the 24 * [k * (2e)^2 / 2 m]. Wait, maybe I should have divided by 2 m, but perhaps I did that correctly.

Wait, another approach: (2e)^2 = 4e². So, each pair contributes (4e²) * k / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / m. Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters. So each pair's energy is (4e² * k) / (2 m) = (2 k e²)/ (m). Wait, no, 2e * 2e is 4e², divided by 2 m, so 4e² k/(2 m) = 2e² k/(m). Wait, but m is meters. Wait, no, perhaps the actual expression is U = k q1 q2 / r. So for each pair between P and the 12, U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e². So each pair contributes 2 k e². 12 pairs, so total is 24 k e².

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't have 5.5e-27. So perhaps I missed the mutual interactions. Let's think about that.

Each pair of the 12 charges contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them.

If all 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, the average distance between any two charges can be calculated, but it's a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps for the minimum energy, the mutual potential energy is considered, but it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem counts the mutual interactions as well. So, the total potential energy would be the sum of all pairs: 12 interactions with the fixed charge and 66 interactions among the 12.

Wait, but without knowing the exact r_ij for each pair, it's impossible to calculate the exact sum. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, and only consider the 12 interactions with the fixed charge. But then the answer I got is approximately 5.534e-27 J, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 5.645 x10^-26

B) 2.822 x10^-26

C) 7.056 x10^-27

D) 122.330

Hmm, my calculated value of ~5.534e-27 is closest to option C (7.056e-27) but still off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 24 * k * e².

Calculating 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2: 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute 8.988 * 2.566.

8 *2.566=20.528

0.988 *2.566≈ 2.536

Total ≈23.064.

So, 23.064e-29 (since 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29).

Multiply by 24: 23.064e-29 *24 = 553.536e-29 = 5.53536e-27 J.

Hmm. So 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options again, none match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the system's potential energy as if they're all interacting with each other. But without knowing their arrangement, maybe the problem assumes that all 12 are at the same point. Wait, but that's impossible because they are constrained to be 2 m apart from P. So, perhaps the problem is formulated such that the 12 charges are themselves at a distance of 2 m from each other, but that doesn't make sense because if they're on a sphere of radius 2 m around P, their mutual distances can't all be 2 m. Only some of them can be 2 m apart if they are diametrically opposite, but others would be further apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have only the 12 charges interact with the fixed charge, and their mutual interactions are negligible. But then why is the answer not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let's recheck the formula.

Wait, each pair between the 12 and the fixed charge contributes U = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2 m.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, 24 k e² is the total.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Calculate 1.602e-19 squared: 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38 = (about 23.06) * 1e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.306e-28 = 55.344e-28 = 5.5344e-27 J.

Hmm, this is the same as before.

Looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct approach is to include the mutual interactions between the 12 charges.

Wait, each of the 12 charges contributes to the system's potential energy by interacting with all other 11. So, for each pair among the 12, the potential energy is U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them.

But without knowing r_ij, how can we compute this? Perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, but that's not possible unless they are arranged in a regular form, like a regular icosahedron or something, but even then, distances vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2 m. But wait, if all 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two can't all be 2m. For example, if two charges are at opposite ends of the sphere, their distance is 4m. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the mutual interactions are to be considered as all being at a distance of 4 meters. No, that can't be right because that would be the maximum distance on the sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are 2 meters each, but that's not possible in 3D space because you can't have 12 points all separated by 2 meters on a sphere of radius 2 meters. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, treating the 12 charges as fixed and not interacting. But then the answer I calculated isn't among the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27. Hmm, that's about twice the 5.53e-27 I calculated. So perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, so 12 interactions. But perhaps I forgot that each interaction is counted once, so 12 * (2e * 2e)/(2m) * k.

Wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, wait, maybe the 13th charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each pair is (2e)*(2e) =4e². So each pair contributes 4e² *k / (2m) = 2e² k /m. So 12 pairs contribute 24 e² k /m.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of 24 * k * e².

Wait, let me compute each step again.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, 24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiplying them gives:

8.988 * 2.566 = Let's compute this accurately.

8 * 2.566 =20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 = 2.536.

So total is 20.528 + 2.536 = 23.064.

So, 23.064 * 1e9 * 1e-38 = 23.064e-29.

Multiply by 24:

24 * 23.064e-29 = 553.536e-29 = 5.53536e-27 J.

Hmm, same result as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts each pair twice? Like, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, but perhaps I'm supposed to multiply by 2 because each pair is counted once from each charge's perspective. But no, in potential energy calculations, each pair is counted once.

Alternatively, maybe the problem includes the 13th charge being acted upon by the 12, but in reality, the potential energy is the same regardless of the direction, so it's correct as is.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the potential energy as the work done to bring the 12 charges from infinity to their positions. So, the initial state has all charges at infinity, and you bring each charge to its position one by one.

In that case, each charge would contribute an energy equal to the potential at the point P due to all the previously placed charges.

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me think. When you bring the first charge, since P is at rest, the potential at P is zero. So the work done to bring the first charge (2e) to 2m from P is zero. Then, bringing the second charge: the potential at P due to the first charge is V = k*(2e)/(2m), so the work done to bring the second charge is (2e) * V = (2e) * [k*(2e)/(2m)] = (2e * 2e k )/(2 m) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, but no, wait. The potential at P after placing the first charge is V1 = k*(2e)/(2m) = k e/m.

Then, the work to bring the second charge is (2e) * V1 = 2e * (k e/m) )= 2 k e²/m.

Similarly, when bringing the third charge, the potential at P is V2 = V1 plus the potential due to the second charge.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated, but maybe it's the right way to calculate the total work done, which is the potential energy of the system.

But in this case, the potential energy would be the sum of the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to all previous charges.

So, for the 13th charge (fixed at P), we don't need to bring it, but the 12 charges are being brought to 2m from P.

So, let's compute the potential energy step by step.

First charge: no existing charges at P, so V=0. Work done: 0.

Second charge: potential at P is V1 = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/m. Work done: (2e) * V1 = 2e*(k e/m) = 2 k e²/m.

Third charge: potential at P due to two charges is V2 = V1 + V2' where V2' = k*(2e)/(2m) again. So V2 = 2*(k e/m). Work done: (2e) * V2 = 2e*(2 k e/m) )=4 k e²/m.

Fourth charge: V3 = 3*(k e/m). Work done: 2e * V3 = 6 k e²/m.

And so on, until the 12th charge.

Wait, so the total work done is the sum for n=1 to 12 of (2e) * (n * (k e/m)) ) ?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The first charge: no work done.

Second charge: work is 2e * (k e/(2m)) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at P after placing (n-1) charges is (n-1) * (k e/(m)), because each charge contributes k*(2e)/(2m) = k e/m. So after n-1 charges, the potential is (n-1) * (k e/m).

Then, the work done to bring the nth charge is (2e) * (n-1) * (k e/m).

So, the total work is sum from n=2 to 12 of [2e * (n-1) * k e/m].

Which simplifies to (2 k e²/m) * sum from n=2 to 12 of (n-1).

The sum from m=1 to 11 of m is (11)(12)/2 = 66.

So, the total work is (2 k e²/m) * 66 = 132 k e²/m.

Wait, but earlier approach where I considered each of the 12 charges interacting with the fixed charge gave 24 k e². But this approach gives 132 k e².

Hmm, but which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the first approach is wrong because it treats each charge's interaction with the fixed charge as an independent pair, but in reality, when you bring each charge, you have to consider the potential created by all the previously placed charges. So the correct method is the second approach, which gives a higher value.

So, with this approach, the total potential energy is 132 k e²/m.

Wait, but in this calculation, m is 2 meters, right? Because each charge is brought to 2m from P.

So, substituting m=2 m:

Total U = 132 * k * e² / 2 = 66 k e².

So, U = 66 * k * e².

Now, compute that:

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So, 66 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.06e-29 as before.

Multiply by 66: 23.06e-29 * 66 = 1,519.56e-29 = 1.51956e-26 J.

Hmm, 1.51956e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, option B is 2.822e-26, which is close to 2.8e-26. Hmm, 1.5e-26 is not exactly matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: when bringing the charges one by one, the potential at P is due to all the previous charges. So, for the nth charge (n starting at 2), the potential at P is (n-1)*(k*(2e)/(2m)) )= (n-1)*(k e/m).

So, the work done to bring the nth charge is (2e) * (n-1)*(k e/m) )= 2 k e² (n-1)/m.

So, the total work is sum from n=2 to 13 (since there are 12 charges) of 2k e² (n-1)/m.

Wait, n runs from 2 to 12 (since there are 12 charges beyond the 13th). So, sum from n=2 to 12: sum of (n-1) from 1 to 11 is (11)(12)/2 =66.

So, total U= 2k e² / m * 66.

Wait, but m is 2 m.

So, U= (2 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) / 2 * 66.

Wait, 2 in numerator and denominator cancels, so U= 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 *66.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 =23.06e-29.

Multiply by 66: 23.06e-29 *66= 1,519.56e-29=1.51956e-26 J.

Wait, but none of the options match this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when bringing the charges, the 13th charge is fixed and the others are brought into place. So the potential at P due to the 13th charge is V = k*(2e)/r, but for each of the 12 charges, when brought in, the potential at P is the sum of potentials from the 13th and all the previously placed 12 charges.

Wait, that complicates things because each charge is placed in the field of the fixed charge and all the previously placed charges. So, perhaps the potential when placing the nth charge is due to the fixed charge (2e at P) plus the sum of the potentials from the (n-1) charges already placed.

So, for the first charge, the potential at P is V1 = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/m.

The work done to bring the first charge is (2e) * V1' where V1' is the potential at P before placing any other charges besides the fixed one. Wait, no, actually, the potential at P is due to the fixed charge (2e) and all previously placed charges.

Wait, when bringing the first movable charge (charge 2), the potential at P is due to the fixed charge (2e) only. So, V = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/m.

The work done to bring charge 2 is (2e) * V = 2e*(k e/m) )= 2 k e²/m.

Then, bringing charge 3: the potential at P is due to charge 13 (2e) and charge 2 (2e). So, V = k*(2e)/(2m) + k*(2e)/(2m) )= 2*(k e/m).

Work done for charge 3: (2e) * V = 2e*(2 k e/m) )=4 k e²/m.

Similarly, bringing charge 4: potential is 3*(k e/m). Work done: 6 k e²/m.

And so on, up to charge 12: the work done is (2e) * 11*(k e/m) )=22 k e²/m.

So, the total work is the sum from n=1 to 11 of (2e) * n * (k e/m) ).

Sum = 2 k e²/m * sum(n=1 to 11) n.

Sum from 1 to 11 is 66.

So, total U= 2 k e²/m *66 =132 k e²/m.

Wait, but m is 2m, so:

U= 132 * k e² / 2 =66 k e².

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before: 66 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =66 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Wait, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.06e-29.

Multiply by 66: 23.06e-29 *66=1519.56e-29 =1.51956e-26 J.

Again, this isn't matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach: perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th, and not their mutual interactions. So the total potential energy is 12*(k*(2e)^2/(2m)).

Which is 12*(4e² k/(2m)) =12*(2 e² k/m )=24 e² k/m.

With m=2m? Wait, m is 2 meters.

So, U=24 * (e² k) / (2) =12 e² k.

So, 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute e²*k: (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9=23.06e-29.

Multiply by 12: 276.72e-29=2.7672e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.77e-27 J. Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 12 * 2 e² k / (2 m).

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 24 e² k/(2*2 m) ?

Wait, no, the formula is U = (k q1 q2)/r.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, so U = 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Yes, that's correct. So 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) =12 * 2 e² k / m =24 e² k / m.

m=2 m, so U=24 e² k/(2 )=12 e² k.

So, 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute e² *k: (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 =2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =23.06e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.06e-29 *12 =276.72e-29 =2.767e-27 J.

Which is about 2.767e-27 J. None of the options match that exactly, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual interactions as well. Let's estimate the mutual potential energy.

Assuming that the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 meters. The average distance between any two charges can be found, but it's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is the same as the interactions each has with the fixed charge, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of the 12 charges contributes an energy of k*(2e)^2/(4 m), since the distance between any two charges on the sphere would be 4 meters if they're on opposite ends, but that's the maximum. The average distance would be less. But without exact data, perhaps the problem neglects the mutual interactions, as the options don't include the result. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the energy as if all the 12 charges are at a distance of 2 meters from each other, which would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well as from the fixed charge. So, each mutual pair contributes U =k*(2e)^2/(2m).

But that would mean each of the 66 mutual pairs contributes 2e² k/m. So, 66 * 2e² k/m =132 e² k/m.

Adding that to the 12 interactions with the fixed charge: 24 e² k/m.

Total U = (24 +132) e² k/m =156 e² k/m.

But since m=2 m, U=156 e² k/(2 )=78 e² k.

So, 78 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute 78 * (2.566e-38) *8.988e9.

Wait, 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.06e-29.

Multiply by 78: 23.06e-29 *78 =1,798.68e-29 =1.79868e-26 J.

Hmm, that's about 1.8e-26 J. Still not matching the options.

I'm getting stuck here because the problem doesn't specify the mutual distances, and without that, it's hard to calculate their contributions accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the 12 interactions with the fixed charge to be considered, which gives about 2.77e-27 J, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering 12 charges. The problem says 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the 12 are moving, but their positions are fixed at 2 m from P. So their mutual interactions are fixed as well, but without knowing their mutual distances, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate only the 12 interactions with the fixed charge, giving about 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about twice the value I calculated. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions.

Wait, perhaps each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, but the 13th is 2e, so each pair contributes (2e)*(2e)/(2m) *k.

Which is 4e²/(2m) *k = 2e² k/m.

So, 12 pairs contribute 12 * 2e² k/m =24 e² k/m.

Wait, but m is 2 m, so 24 e² k/(2 )=12 e² k.

So, 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute e² *k = (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9=23.06e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.06e-29 *12=276.7e-29=2.767e-27 J.

Again, same as before.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy of the system considering only the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge. Then, the answer is approximately 2.77e-27 J, which isn't any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the charges to be considered as a single charge. But no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 12 * 2e² k/m again.

m=2m, so 12 * 2e² k/(2) =12 e² k.

So, 12 * ( (1.602e-19)^2 ) * (8.988e9) =12 * (2.566e-38) *8.988e9.

Wait, 2.566e-38 *8.988e9=23.06e-29.

Multiply by 12: 276.7e-29=2.767e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

So, k=9e9.

Then, 12 e² k =12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *9e9.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply by 9e9: 2.566e-38 *9e9=23.094e-29.

Multiply by 12: 277.128e-29=2.77128e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, looking at option C)7.056e-27. That's about 2.55 times higher than 2.77e-27. 7.056 /2.77 ≈2.55.

Hmm, perhaps the problem includes both the 12 interactions and the mutual interactions of the 12 charges.

If the mutual interactions contribute an additional factor, perhaps it's 3 times the initial value, leading to 8.31e-27, but that's not matching option C either.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are negligible, and the correct answer is 2.77e-27 J, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial assumption. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So, each of them is 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are fixed as well. So, perhaps each pair of the 12 is exactly 2 m apart. But that can't be, because in 3D space, you can't have 12 points all separated by 2 m on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the 12 charges is 2 m away from P and also 2 m away from each other. But that would require a regular structure, but even then, it's not possible with 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's 12 charges at a distance of 2 m from each other. But that's unclear.

Since I'm stuck and time is limited, I'll have to make an educated guess. The closest option to my initial calculation of 5.53e-27 J isn't present, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is approximately twice my initial value. So, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers each pair twice, which would double the initial 5.53e-27 to about 1.1e-26, but that's not exactly matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended for the energy to be calculated as the potential energy between all pairs, including mutual, but without knowing their distances, perhaps it's impossible.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is intended to compute the potential energy using the formula for a system of point charges, considering all pairs. The total potential energy is the sum of (k q1 q2)/r for each pair.

In this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from P. So, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, and each of the 12 interacts with the other 11.

So, total U is U1 + U2, where U1 is the energy due to the 12-13th pairs, and U2 is the energy due to the 12-12 pairs.

Compute U1:

Each pair between 12 and 13: 12 pairs, each contributing (2e)(2e)/(2m) *k.

So, 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) =24 e² k/m.

Compute U2:

Each pair between the 12 charges: 12C2=66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(r_ij) *k.

But without knowing r_ij, what can we do? Perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, say, 2 meters. But that's not possible for more than 3 charges on a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 4 m, which is the diameter of the sphere. But that's the maximum possible distance between any two points on a sphere of radius 2 m.

If we assume that each pair of the 12 charges is 4 m apart, then U2=66*(4e² k)/(4 m).

Wait, 4m because r_ij is 4 m. So, 66 * (4e² k)/(4 m) )=66 e² k/m.

So, total U = U1 + U2 =24 e² k/m +66 e² k/m =90 e² k/m.

Now, m=2 m, so U=90 e² k/(2) =45 e² k.

So, 45*(1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute 1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9:23.06e-29.

Multiply by 45: 1.0377e-27 J.

Hmm, this is about 1.0377e-27 J. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2 m, which would make U2=66*(4e²k)/(2m).

Which is 66*(2e² k/m) )=132 e² k/m.

U= U1 + U2 =24 e² k/m +132 e² k/m=156 e² k/m.

m=2m, so U=78 e² k.

Compute 78 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =78 *23.06e-29=1.802e-27 J.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended approach is to only consider the 12 interactions and not the mutual ones, leading to 2.77e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for the potential energy of a system with point charges, considering all interactions, but without knowing the mutual distances, I can't proceed further.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice. The only option that's in the same order of magnitude as my initial calculation is option C)7.056e-27 J. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, option B)2.822e-26 is 10 times higher than my initial 2.77e-27.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor because I used 2e for each charge. Let me double-check the charge value.

Each charge is 2e, so q=2e.

So, the initial calculation for U1 is 12 * [k*(2e)(2e)/(2m)] =12*(4e² k)/(2m) )=24 e² k/m.

Which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant or e. Let me recompute with precise numbers.

Using k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602176634e-19 C.

Compute e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 =2.56696985e-38 C².

Compute 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.56696985e-38) / 2.

Wait, no, the formula is 24 * (e² * k) / m.

Where m=2 m.

So, e²*k=2.56696985e-38 *8.988e9 =2.30606e-28.

24 * 2.30606e-28 / 2 =24 *1.15303e-28=27.6727e-28=2.76727e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J. But I'm not sure how to get there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute 24 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m).

Wait, (2e)^2=4e².

So, 24 * (4e² *k)/(2m) )=24 * (2 e² k/m) )=48 e² k/m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because each pair is 2e * 2e =4e², and the distance is 2 m.

So, each pair contributes (4e² k)/(2 m) =2 e²k/m.

With 12 pairs, that's 24 e²k/m.

Wait, but I think I was correct earlier.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 2.77e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 2.55 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem considers each charge as being 2e, so each pair contributes (2e)^2=4e².

But perhaps the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 2 m, so each pair contributes (4e² *k) / (2 m) )=2e² k/m.

12 pairs: 24 e² k/m.

But, since m=2 m, U=24 e² k/(2)=12 e² k.

So, 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute 1.602e-19^2=2.566e-38.

2.566e-38 *8.988e9=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.306e-28 *12=2.767e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

Given that none of the options match, I think the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem setup.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The energy of the system is derived from the electric potential energy between the charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **System Setup**:  
   - The 13th charge is fixed at \( P \), and the other 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \).  
   - The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique charge pairs.  

2. **Potential Energy Formula**:  
   The potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:  
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is Coulomb's constant, and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) is the elementary charge.

3. **Interactions with the Fixed Charge (13th Charge)**:  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge at \( P \). The energy for each pair is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy from these interactions is:  
   \[
   U_1 = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
   \]

4. **Mutual Interactions Between the 12 Charges**:  
   The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from \( P \), but the distances between them are not explicitly given. If their mutual interactions are considered, the potential energy contributions depend on their arrangement. However, without explicit information about their mutual distances, the problem likely assumes that these interactions are negligible or ignored.

5. **Energy Calculation**:  
   Substituting the values of \( k \) and \( e \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   U_1 = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
   \]  
   Compute step-by-step:  
   \[
   8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 23.06 \times 10^{-29}
   \]  
   \[
   U_1 = 24 \cdot 23.06 \times 10^{-29} = 553.44 \times 10^{-29} = 5.5344 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( 5.5344 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 2.55 times higher. This discrepancy may arise from additional assumptions or approximations not explicitly stated in the problem, such as including mutual interactions or rounding differences.

### Conclusion:
Given the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, as it is the closest to the computed value.

Answer: C
