Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about isomers and tautomerism. Hmm, let's see. I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Oh right, there are constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

Let's tackle part A first. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, leading to structural isomerism. For example, in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups, like in enols and ketones. The keto-enol tautomerism is common in compounds with alpha hydrogens next to carbonyl groups.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone, right? It has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. But wait, the structure—benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So, the structure is like a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. Wait, no, benzoquinone can be para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) or meta (1,3) positions, but I think the most common is para. So, when you have two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring, do they have any possibility of tautomerism?

Tautomerism usually requires adjacent groups where a hydrogen can move. In benzoquinone, each ketone group is C=O, and the adjacent positions are either carbons (from the ring) or other oxygens. Wait, but in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Each carbonyl is on adjacent carbons in the ring? No, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the two carbonyls are at positions 1 and 4, which are opposite each other. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon in the ring, but the adjacent positions are just ring carbons. So, do these carbonyls have alpha hydrogens?

No, because the carbonyls are connected to the ring. Wait, the ring carbons are all part of the aromatic ring, so they don't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyls. So, the carbons next to the carbonyl groups are either part of the ring (without hydrogens, since benzene is sp² hybridized and each has one hydrogen if they are in certain positions) or perhaps not. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, each C=O is attached to a benzene carbon. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which don't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbon. Because in the benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one or two other carbons, and possibly a substituent. So, the carbonyl carbons are only attached to the benzene ring and an oxygen, so they don't have any alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism isn't possible because you need a hydrogen on the alpha carbon to shift. So, benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C, connected in a ring. Wait, more accurately, it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at every other carbon. So, each C=O is separated by a CH2 group. Or wait, 1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups, each on adjacent carbons? Wait, 1,3,5 are every other position in a six-membered ring, so they are spaced by two carbons each. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2... no, wait, actually, wait. Let me think: the numbering. 1,3,5 would be three positions in the ring, each two apart. So, the carbons 1,3,5 have ketone groups, and the 2,4,6 have CH2 groups or maybe something else.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, I think it's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So, each ketone is separated by one CH2 group. So, the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C, but that might not be accurate. Wait, perhaps each carbonyl is at the 1,3,5 positions, so each is adjacent to the next by two carbons. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons which are CH2 groups.

In any case, the question is whether this compound undergoes tautomerism. So, do any of the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens? Alpha hydrogens are on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. Let's see, in the trione structure, each carbonyl is at C1, C3, C5. The adjacent carbons would be C2, C6, C4, etc., and those are CH2 groups. So, each of these adjacent carbons would have hydrogens attached. Therefore, the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens available.

So, each C=O in the trione is attached to a CH2 group. These CH2 groups have hydrogens that are alpha to the carbonyl. Therefore, the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait. Let me think about that. If the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, can tautomerism still occur?

Alternatively, maybe in the trione, the conjugation is such that the hydrogens are not alpha. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at every other position. Each ketone is at C1, C3, C5. Each of these ketones is attached to a CH2 group on either side. So, for example, C1 is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-... etc. So, the CH2 groups are between the ketones. So, each of these CH2 carbons has two hydrogens.

Now, for tautomerism, the hydrogen must be alpha to the carbonyl. So, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls have alpha hydrogens. So, in that case, the trione would have alpha hydrogens, making tautomerism possible.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the molecule is symmetric, maybe tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary structure isn't present. Let me think. Benzoquinone can't have tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are attached to the aromatic ring, which lacks alpha hydrogens. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So, if benzoquinone can't and the trione can, then the one that doesn't is benzoquinone. So, for part A, the correct answer would be that benzoquinone (A) does not show tautomerism, so A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but the options for A are either benzoquinone or trione. The question says, "the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)".

So, if trione does show tautomerism and benzoquinone does not, then A is benzoquinone. So, looking at the options, option D says A=benzoquinone, B=dimethyl fumarate.

Now, part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3. Wait, wait, let me draw it. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOH. Then, its methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the molecule has a chiral center at the middle carbon (the one with the OH group). Because the four groups attached are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen (from CH2). Wait, wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is CH3-CH2-C(OH)O-OCH3? No, wait, no. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking at the carbon where the OH is attached: it's the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the carbon chain. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3. So, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

So, the middle carbon (CH2) has the OH group on it. But wait, that's the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait again.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-CH3.

Wait, no, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think of the carbon chain. The propanoate is three carbons. The methyl ester would have the OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, the OH is on the second carbon (CH2). So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- A CH2OH group,
- A CH2COOCH3 group,
- And two other groups?

Wait, the central carbon is the second carbon in propanoic acid. So, in the ester, the structure is:

COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon, the OH is attached to the second, and the first carbon is CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the carbon with OH is the second carbon. What are the groups attached to this carbon? The four substituents would be:

- CH3 (from carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

Wait, wait. No, because the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3),
- OH,
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, that would mean the central carbon is CH(OH), so the substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and H.

So, four different groups attached to the same carbon. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Thus, the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a di-carboxylic acid with two double bonds, or wait, no: fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. So, fumarate would be the ester form, like dimethyl fumarate: O=C-(CH2)2-C(=O)OCH3, but wait, that's not right.

Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with a trans configuration. Or is it HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is an unsaturated acid. It's HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is actually HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and it's in the trans configuration. So, the structure is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait, no double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up with maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with a cis double bond. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the same as maleic acid but with a trans double bond.

Wait, no. Maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. So, the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that can't be because that would be succinic acid. Wait, no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the groups on either side are trans.

So, dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester, so it would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(OOC)CH3. But wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the ester groups are on each end? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the middle two carbons and the two COOH groups on either end. And in dimethyl fumarate, the two -OH groups of the COOH are replaced by OMe groups. So, the structure is OMeOOC-CH=CH-COO-OMe. So, the two ester groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans) of the double bond?

Wait, no, the esterification would replace the -OH in the acid with OMe. So, the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. Now, the question is whether this molecule has stereoisomerism.

In this structure, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and each of those carbons is attached to an ester group (OCH3 and COOCH3 groups? Or wait, each of those carbons is attached to a carbonyl group and an ester group.

Wait, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2 ?

No, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So, the structure is CH₂=C(COO2Me)CH2(COO2Me), no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps I should just think about the structure. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid has a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two middle carbons.

So, when you esterify both -COOH groups with methanol, you get O=C-OCH3 on each end. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So, it's O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that would imply a single bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of fumarate as the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So, the di-ester would have two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 and O=C-OCH3 connected across a double bond. So, the structure would be:

O=C-OCH3
   \
CH₂=CH
   /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, but that would be a conjugated system. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule have E (trans) geometry.

Wait, but wait, can dimethyl fumarate have stereoisomerism? The double bond in dimethyl fumarate is between two carbonyl groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between two methylene groups, each attached to a carbonyl. So, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to an ester group (O-CO-OCH3) and a CH3 group? Or perhaps, each has an ester group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH2CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond. No, wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each attached to an ester group. So, the structure would be O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O but with a double bond, making it O=C-OCH₂-CH₂O-C=O, but that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So, each CH₂ group is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, the molecule is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂.

In this structure, the double bond is between two CH₂ groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on each end of the double bond are COOCH3 and H.

Wait, wait, no. If the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, then each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O. No, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it from another angle.

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester form of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with a trans double bond. When both -OH groups are esterified with methanol, you get the structure where each -COOH becomes -COOCH3.

So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end of the double bond. So, the molecule would be:

O=C-OCH3
   \
CH₂=CH
   /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, but that would imply a symmetrical structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      CH₂=CH
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that's not possible because you can't have a double bond like that. Alternatively, maybe it's:

O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

I think I need to find whether dimethyl fumarate has stereoisomerism. Since fumaric acid is a trans-dicarboxylic acid, its di-ester would have the same trans configuration across the double bond.

Wait, but wait, can the double bond in dimethyl fumarate have geometric isomerism?

Yes, the double bond is between two carbons that each have two different substituents. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (or another substituent),
- And the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two different groups. Let me think: Each end of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents (COOCH3 and CH2-), so the molecule can have E and Z isomerism.

Wait, but I thought fumaric acid is trans (E), so when esterified, the double bond remains trans, so dimethyl fumarate is in the E configuration. But if the double bond can have E and Z configurations, then dimethyl fumarate can exist as two stereoisomers.

Wait, but wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group (which is attached to another COOCH3). Hmm, perhaps each carbon is connected to two identical groups, making it impossible to have geometric isomerism. Wait, no, because each carbon has two different substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, maybe each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group that's attached to another COOCH3. So, each carbon has two different substituents. Therefore, the molecule has a double bond with two different groups on each side, allowing for E and Z isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate would have geometric isomerism. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which refers to stereoisomerism due to chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. So, if the molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? Let me look again. The structure has a double bond, but the substituents on each end are:

Each C=O group is attached to an OCH3. Wait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen each. Or not.

Wait, given that I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about what the question is asking. It's asking which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: does it have any chiral centers? Let me think. The structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond. No, wait, if the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond, so no double bond. Wait, no, that can't be right. I think I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that would imply a double bond in the middle. So, each CH is attached to an O-CO-OCH3 group and a CH₂ group. So, each CH would have two different substituents: COOCH3 and CH2COOCH3. Therefore, each of these carbons is connected to two different groups, but are they the same on both ends?

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each carbon are the same, making it impossible for geometric isomerism. For example, if both ends are the same, the molecule is symmetric and can't have E or Z isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, like in a trans configuration, then it won't have a chiral center. But wait, dimethyl fumarate structure: O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O. Wait, but that's a single bond. No, no, wait, the structure must have a double bond. So, it's O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but the middle is a single bond. No, that's not correct. Fumarate has a double bond in the acid, so the ester would have the same.

So, the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH₂-O-C=O, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's O=C-OCH₂-CH₂-O-C=O, but the middle is a double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH₂-CH₂-O-C=O with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would imply a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH₂-CH₂-O-C=O, but the central is a single bond. No, that's not right because fumarate is a di-ester of a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck on the structure and think about the properties. Dimethyl fumarate is a di-ester with a double bond, and whether it has any stereogenic centers.

Wait, another approach: does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. For example, if the substituents on each end are mirror images, then the molecule is achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents, making the molecule symmetric.

Wait, but if each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two different groups, it's possible to have a double bond with E and Z configurations, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center.

So, if dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't show optical isomerism. So, which of the two compounds has a chiral center?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, as I thought earlier. So, it can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: if it doesn't have a chiral center, then it wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again.

The structure could be (CH2COOCH3)₂ with a double bond. So, it's CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, no, that would be CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. Each CH₂ is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and the other carbon. So, each carbon is attached to two identical groups, which would mean that the molecule is not chiral, as there's a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents, then the molecule is symmetric. So, it's not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and can't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, among the two, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. Therefore, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, wait, but looking back, I thought the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So, it can show optical isomerism. So, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, what about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate? If it doesn't have a chiral center, then the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it together:

Part A: The compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option A says A = trione, which is incorrect because trione does show tautomerism.

So, the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answers for parts (A) and (B), we analyze the compounds and their properties:

---

### Part (A): Compound that does not show tautomerism

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). In benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the aromatic ring, which lacks alpha hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone group is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which contains alpha hydrogens. Since alpha hydrogens are present, this compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part (B): Compound that shows optical isomerism

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at the second position (the one with the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. Therefore, this compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, with the structure O=C-OCH₂-CH=CH-CO-OCH₃. The double bond in the center allows for geometric isomerism (E/Z), but it does not have any chiral centers. Since optical isomerism requires a chiral center, dimethyl fumarate cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer

From the analysis above:

- For Part (A), the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part (B), the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about isomers and tautomerism. Hmm, let's see. I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Oh right, there are constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

Let's tackle part A first. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, leading to structural isomerism. For example, in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups, like in enols and ketones. The keto-enol tautomerism is common in compounds with alpha hydrogens next to carbonyl groups.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone, right? It has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. But wait, the structure—benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So, the structure is like a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. Wait, no, benzoquinone can be para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) or meta (1,3) positions, but I think the most common is para. So, when you have two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring, do they have any possibility of tautomerism?

Tautomerism usually requires adjacent groups where a hydrogen can move. In benzoquinone, each ketone group is C=O, and the adjacent positions are either carbons (from the ring) or other oxygens. Wait, but in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Each carbonyl is on adjacent carbons in the ring? No, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the two carbonyls are at positions 1 and 4, which are opposite each other. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon in the ring, but the adjacent positions are just ring carbons. So, do these carbonyls have alpha hydrogens?

No, because the carbonyls are connected to the ring. Wait, the ring carbons are all part of the aromatic ring, so they don't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyls. So, the carbons next to the carbonyl groups are either part of the ring (without hydrogens, since benzene is sp² hybridized and each has one hydrogen if they are in certain positions) or perhaps not. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, each C=O is attached to a benzene carbon. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which don't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbon. Because in the benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one or two other carbons, and possibly a substituent. So, the carbonyl carbons are only attached to the benzene ring and an oxygen, so they don't have any alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism isn't possible because you need a hydrogen on the alpha carbon to shift. So, benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C, connected in a ring. Wait, more accurately, it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at every other carbon. So, each C=O is separated by a CH2 group. Or wait, 1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups, each on adjacent carbons? Wait, 1,3,5 are every other position in a six-membered ring, so they are spaced by two carbons each. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2... no, wait, actually, wait. Let me think: the numbering. 1,3,5 would be three positions in the ring, each two apart. So, the carbons 1,3,5 have ketone groups, and the 2,4,6 have CH2 groups or maybe something else.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, I think it's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So, each ketone is separated by one CH2 group. So, the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C, but that might not be accurate. Wait, perhaps each carbonyl is at the 1,3,5 positions, so each is adjacent to the next by two carbons. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons which are CH2 groups.

In any case, the question is whether this compound undergoes tautomerism. So, do any of the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens? Alpha hydrogens are on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. Let's see, in the trione structure, each carbonyl is at C1, C3, C5. The adjacent carbons would be C2, C6, C4, etc., and those are CH2 groups. So, each of these adjacent carbons would have hydrogens attached. Therefore, the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens available.

So, each C=O in the trione is attached to a CH2 group. These CH2 groups have hydrogens that are alpha to the carbonyl. Therefore, the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but wait. Let me think about that. If the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, can tautomerism still occur?

Alternatively, maybe in the trione, the conjugation is such that the hydrogens are not alpha. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at every other position. Each ketone is at C1, C3, C5. Each of these ketones is attached to a CH2 group on either side. So, for example, C1 is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-... etc. So, the CH2 groups are between the ketones. So, each of these CH2 carbons has two hydrogens.

Now, for tautomerism, the hydrogen must be alpha to the carbonyl. So, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls have alpha hydrogens. So, in that case, the trione would have alpha hydrogens, making tautomerism possible.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the molecule is symmetric, maybe tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary structure isn't present. Let me think. Benzoquinone can't have tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are attached to the aromatic ring, which lacks alpha hydrogens. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So, if benzoquinone can't and the trione can, then the one that doesn't is benzoquinone. So, for part A, the correct answer would be that benzoquinone (A) does not show tautomerism, so A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but the options for A are either benzoquinone or trione. The question says, "the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)".

So, if trione does show tautomerism and benzoquinone does not, then A is benzoquinone. So, looking at the options, option D says A=benzoquinone, B=dimethyl fumarate.

Now, part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3. Wait, wait, let me draw it. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOH. Then, its methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the molecule has a chiral center at the middle carbon (the one with the OH group). Because the four groups attached are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen (from CH2). Wait, wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is CH3-CH2-C(OH)O-OCH3? No, wait, no. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking at the carbon where the OH is attached: it's the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the carbon chain. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3. So, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

So, the middle carbon (CH2) has the OH group on it. But wait, that's the second carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait again.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-CH3.

Wait, no, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think of the carbon chain. The propanoate is three carbons. The methyl ester would have the OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, the OH is on the second carbon (CH2). So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- A CH2OH group,
- A CH2COOCH3 group,
- And two other groups?

Wait, the central carbon is the second carbon in propanoic acid. So, in the ester, the structure is:

COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon, the OH is attached to the second, and the first carbon is CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

So, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the carbon with OH is the second carbon. What are the groups attached to this carbon? The four substituents would be:

- CH3 (from carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

Wait, wait. No, because the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3),
- OH,
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, that would mean the central carbon is CH(OH), so the substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and H.

So, four different groups attached to the same carbon. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Thus, the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a di-carboxylic acid with two double bonds, or wait, no: fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. So, fumarate would be the ester form, like dimethyl fumarate: O=C-(CH2)2-C(=O)OCH3, but wait, that's not right.

Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with a trans configuration. Or is it HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is an unsaturated acid. It's HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is actually HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons, and it's in the trans configuration. So, the structure is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait, no double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up with maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with a cis double bond. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the same as maleic acid but with a trans double bond.

Wait, no. Maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. So, the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that can't be because that would be succinic acid. Wait, no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the groups on either side are trans.

So, dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester, so it would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(OOC)CH3. But wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the ester groups are on each end? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the middle two carbons and the two COOH groups on either end. And in dimethyl fumarate, the two -OH groups of the COOH are replaced by OMe groups. So, the structure is OMeOOC-CH=CH-COO-OMe. So, the two ester groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans) of the double bond?

Wait, no, the esterification would replace the -OH in the acid with OMe. So, the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. Now, the question is whether this molecule has stereoisomerism.

In this structure, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and each of those carbons is attached to an ester group (OCH3 and COOCH3 groups? Or wait, each of those carbons is attached to a carbonyl group and an ester group.

Wait, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2 ?

No, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So, the structure is CH₂=C(COO2Me)CH2(COO2Me), no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps I should just think about the structure. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid has a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two middle carbons.

So, when you esterify both -COOH groups with methanol, you get O=C-OCH3 on each end. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So, it's O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH₂
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that would imply a single bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of fumarate as the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So, the di-ester would have two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 and O=C-OCH3 connected across a double bond. So, the structure would be:

O=C-OCH3
   \
CH₂=CH
   /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, but that would be a conjugated system. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule have E (trans) geometry.

Wait, but wait, can dimethyl fumarate have stereoisomerism? The double bond in dimethyl fumarate is between two carbonyl groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between two methylene groups, each attached to a carbonyl. So, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to an ester group (O-CO-OCH3) and a CH3 group? Or perhaps, each has an ester group and a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH2CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond. No, wait, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each attached to an ester group. So, the structure would be O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O but with a double bond, making it O=C-OCH₂-CH₂O-C=O, but that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. So, each CH₂ group is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, the molecule is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂.

In this structure, the double bond is between two CH₂ groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on each end of the double bond are COOCH3 and H.

Wait, wait, no. If the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, then each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O. No, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it from another angle.

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester form of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with a trans double bond. When both -OH groups are esterified with methanol, you get the structure where each -COOH becomes -COOCH3.

So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 on each end of the double bond. So, the molecule would be:

O=C-OCH3
   \
CH₂=CH
   /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, but that would imply a symmetrical structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      CH₂=CH
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that's not possible because you can't have a double bond like that. Alternatively, maybe it's:

O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond. Hmm.

I think I need to find whether dimethyl fumarate has stereoisomerism. Since fumaric acid is a trans-dicarboxylic acid, its di-ester would have the same trans configuration across the double bond.

Wait, but wait, can the double bond in dimethyl fumarate have geometric isomerism?

Yes, the double bond is between two carbons that each have two different substituents. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (or another substituent),
- And the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two different groups. Let me think: Each end of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents (COOCH3 and CH2-), so the molecule can have E and Z isomerism.

Wait, but I thought fumaric acid is trans (E), so when esterified, the double bond remains trans, so dimethyl fumarate is in the E configuration. But if the double bond can have E and Z configurations, then dimethyl fumarate can exist as two stereoisomers.

Wait, but wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group (which is attached to another COOCH3). Hmm, perhaps each carbon is connected to two identical groups, making it impossible to have geometric isomerism. Wait, no, because each carbon has two different substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, maybe each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group that's attached to another COOCH3. So, each carbon has two different substituents. Therefore, the molecule has a double bond with two different groups on each side, allowing for E and Z isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate would have geometric isomerism. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which refers to stereoisomerism due to chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. So, if the molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? Let me look again. The structure has a double bond, but the substituents on each end are:

Each C=O group is attached to an OCH3. Wait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen each. Or not.

Wait, given that I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about what the question is asking. It's asking which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: does it have any chiral centers? Let me think. The structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond. No, wait, if the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that's a single bond, so no double bond. Wait, no, that can't be right. I think I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that would imply a double bond in the middle. So, each CH is attached to an O-CO-OCH3 group and a CH₂ group. So, each CH would have two different substituents: COOCH3 and CH2COOCH3. Therefore, each of these carbons is connected to two different groups, but are they the same on both ends?

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each carbon are the same, making it impossible for geometric isomerism. For example, if both ends are the same, the molecule is symmetric and can't have E or Z isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, like in a trans configuration, then it won't have a chiral center. But wait, dimethyl fumarate structure: O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O. Wait, but that's a single bond. No, no, wait, the structure must have a double bond. So, it's O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-C=O, but the middle is a single bond. No, that's not correct. Fumarate has a double bond in the acid, so the ester would have the same.

So, the structure is O=C-OCH2-CH₂-O-C=O, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's O=C-OCH₂-CH₂-O-C=O, but the middle is a double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH₂-CH₂-O-C=O with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would imply a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH₂-CH₂-O-C=O, but the central is a single bond. No, that's not right because fumarate is a di-ester of a di-carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck on the structure and think about the properties. Dimethyl fumarate is a di-ester with a double bond, and whether it has any stereogenic centers.

Wait, another approach: does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. For example, if the substituents on each end are mirror images, then the molecule is achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents, making the molecule symmetric.

Wait, but if each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two different groups, it's possible to have a double bond with E and Z configurations, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center.

So, if dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't show optical isomerism. So, which of the two compounds has a chiral center?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, as I thought earlier. So, it can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: if it doesn't have a chiral center, then it wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again.

The structure could be (CH2COOCH3)₂ with a double bond. So, it's CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, no, that would be CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂. Each CH₂ is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and the other carbon. So, each carbon is attached to two identical groups, which would mean that the molecule is not chiral, as there's a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents, then the molecule is symmetric. So, it's not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and can't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, among the two, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can show optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. Therefore, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, wait, but looking back, I thought the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So, it can show optical isomerism. So, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, what about the other compound, dimethyl fumarate? If it doesn't have a chiral center, then the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it together:

Part A: The compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option A says A = trione, which is incorrect because trione does show tautomerism.

So, the correct option is B.


To determine the correct answers for parts (A) and (B), we analyze the compounds and their properties:

---

### Part (A): Compound that does not show tautomerism

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). In benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the aromatic ring, which lacks alpha hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone group is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which contains alpha hydrogens. Since alpha hydrogens are present, this compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part (B): Compound that shows optical isomerism

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at the second position (the one with the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. Therefore, this compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, with the structure O=C-OCH₂-CH=CH-CO-OCH₃. The double bond in the center allows for geometric isomerism (E/Z), but it does not have any chiral centers. Since optical isomerism requires a chiral center, dimethyl fumarate cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer

From the analysis above:

- For Part (A), the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part (B), the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
