Okay, let's tackle this astronomy question. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember the question said that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag in V to be seen by ESPRESSO, but since HIRES is more sensitive (brighter than 16), the star needs to be brighter than 17 mag, because that's the stricter condition. Oh wait wait, no. Wait, the question says: for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Oh right, stars with lower apparent magnitudes (like 16) are brighter than those with higher (like 17). So for ESPRESSO, they can observe stars with V magnitude ≤17. For HIRES, it's ≤16. So, a star must have V ≤16 to be seen by both, because if it's brighter than 17 (like 18), ESPRESSO can't see it. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, that's not correct. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude of 17 is fainter than 16. So if a star is brighter than 17, that's magnitude less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17. For HIRES, less than or equal to 16. So, a star must have V ≤17 for ESPRESSO and V ≤16 for HIRES. So, the overlapping condition is V ≤16. Because if a star is V=15, both can see it. If V=16.5, then ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 ≤17), but HIRES can't (since 16.5 >16). So, for a star to be detectable by both, it must have apparent V magnitude ≤16.

Wait no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star is brighter than 17, meaning V <17, then ESPRESSO can observe it. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So, the stars that both can observe must have V <16, because that's the lower limit for HIRES. Because any star with V <16 is also <17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So the stars that are brighter than 16 (V <16) can be seen by both.

Wait, but the question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So, each star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because if it's higher than 16, only ESPRESSO can see it.

Now, looking at the stars:

Star1: absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. I need to calculate its apparent V magnitude. The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. So M =15.5, d=10. log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5 +5*(1) = 15.5 +10 =25.5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5? Wait, let me get the formula correct. Oh right, the formula is m - M = 5 log10 (d) -5. So m = M +5 log10 (d) -5.

Wait no, wait: m = M + 5 * (log10 (d) -1) ) *5? Wait, no: the formula is m = M +5*(log10 (d)) -5. Because m - M =5 log10 (d) -5.

So for Star1: M=15.5, d=10. log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5 +5 -5=15.5. So apparent V mag is 15.5. Which is less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it. Wait, but let me check the options. Because the question is about which stars can be seen by both.

Wait, but the options don't include Star1. Let me check each star.

Star1: m=15.5. So it's below 16. So both can detect it.

Star2: m =16.5, which is greater than 16. So only ESPRESSO can detect it, since 16.5 <=17. HIRES can't, because their limit is brighter than 16 (so V <16). So Star2 only ESPRESSO.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, so extinction? The question mentions that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction A_V =3.1 * 0.6 =1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting this backward. The star's light is absorbed, so the observed m is brighter than the intrinsic? Or fainter? Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter. So the observed m is m = m_intrinsic + A_V. Because the star's light is dimmed, making it appear dimmer, so higher magnitude.

Wait, in the case of Star3, the given m is already the apparent V magnitude? Or is it the intrinsic? Wait, let me read Star3's description again. It says: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6. So the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but extinction may affect it. Or wait, maybe the apparent magnitude is the observed one, and we need to correct for extinction. Wait, no, I think the star's apparent magnitude is affected by interstellar extinction, so the given apparent mag (15.5) is the observed, which is already corrected for extinction. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc, E(B-V)=0.6. Then, the note says that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So the extinction is A_V =3.1 * E(B-V)=3.1*0.6=1.86 mag.

Wait, but how does this affect the star's apparent magnitude? Because the star's light is absorbed, so the observed apparent magnitude is m = m_intrinsic + A_V. Because higher magnitude means fainter, so more extinction makes the star appear fainter. So if the star's actual (intrinsic) magnitude is m0, then the observed m is m0 + A_V.

Wait, but no. Wait, for example, if a star's light is dimmed by extinction, making it appear fainter, so the observed apparent magnitude would be higher. So, if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude m0, then with extinction, m = m0 + A_V.

But in Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5. So does that mean that it's already after correction for extinction? Or is it the observed magnitude including extinction? Hmm, the description says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag", and E(B-V)=0.6, so I think the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, which is after extinction. So if we want to get the intrinsic magnitude, we subtract A_V. But for the purpose of detection, the observed m is 15.5, which is the value we should use.

Wait, but wait. When considering whether the instrument can observe it, we need to use the apparent magnitude as observed, including extinction. Because the instrument sees the star through the dust, so the apparent magnitude is already reduced (higher). So for Star3, apparent V is 15.5, which is below 16, so both can detect it.

Wait, but wait another point. Let me think about it. When a star is observed, the extinction makes it appear dimmer, meaning its apparent magnitude is higher (m is larger). So, for example, if a star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0, then with extinction A_V, the observed m is m0 + A_V.

So for Star3, the given m is 15.5. Wait, but that's the apparent magnitude, already considering extinction. Because the description says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Hmm, perhaps the given m is the observed (extincted) apparent magnitude. So, for Star3, the observed m is 15.5, which is below 16, so both can detect it.

Star4: absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. So let's compute its apparent V magnitude.

m = M +5 log10(d) -5 =15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5+5-5=15.5. So apparent V mag is 15.5. E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24 mag. So the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74? Wait, wait no. Because the given apparent magnitude is already the observed (including extinction). So Star4's description says: absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0= M +5 log10(d) -5=15.5 +5*1 -5=15.5. But considering extinction, the observed m is m0 + A_V=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So the observed m is 16.74, which is above 16.5. So HIRES can't detect it (since it requires m <16), but ESPRESSO can (since m <17). So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, but wait the given m for Star4 is the absolute magnitude, right? Or is it the apparent? No, Star4's description says: absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude is m = M +5 log10(d) -5=15.5 +5 -5=15.5. So the m without extinction is 15.5. But with extinction, the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So the observed apparent magnitude is 16.74. So for detection, the HIRES can't see it (since 16.74 >16), but ESPRESSO can (16.74 <17). So Star4 can be detected only by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed". So for ESPRESSO, any star with m <17 can be observed. Star4's m is 16.74, which is <17, so ESPRESSO can. HIRES requires m <16, which 16.74 isn't, so HIRES can't.

So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: absolute magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc. Compute its apparent magnitude without extinction. m = M +5 log10(d) -5 =16.5 +5*(log10(5)) -5. Log10(5) is approximately 0.69897. So 5 *0.69897 ≈3.4949. So m=16.5 +3.4949 -5=16.5 + (-1.5051)=14.9949 ≈15. So apparent magnitude is ~15. E(B-V) is not given, so no extinction. So m=15. So both can detect it. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but let me recheck. Star5's description: absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m=M +5 log10(d) -5. So M=16.5, d=5. log10(5)=0.69897. So 5 * log10(5) is 3.4949. So m=16.5 +3.4949 -5 =16.5 + (-1.5051) =14.9949, which is ~15.0.

So apparent V mag is 15.0, which is <16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

So now, looking back at all stars:

Star1: m=15.5 -> both can detect (since 15.5 <17 and <16? No, wait: 15.5 is less than 16, so both can detect it.

Star2: m=16.5. ESPRESSO can (<=17), HIRES can't (needs <16). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5. Both can detect.

Star4: observed m=16.74. ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't.

Star5: m=15. Both can detect.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5. But Star4 can't be detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both. So this is a possibility.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2 can't be detected by both.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can be, Star4 can't.

So the correct option would include Star3 and Star5. Looking at the options, option B is "Star3 and Star5".

Wait, but let me check the other stars again.

Wait, what about Star3's extinction? Wait, Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is already the observed magnitude (after taking into account extinction). So it's 15.5, which is below 16, so both can detect.

Star5's m is 15, no extinction, so both can.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But looking at the options, which option includes any two of these.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. So that's an option.

Also, Star1 is in option D: Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be detected by both. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for Star5. M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d) -5 =16.5 +5*(log10(5)) -5.

log10(5) is about 0.69897. So 5*0.69897≈3.4949.

So m=16.5 +3.4949 -5 =16.5 + (-1.5051)=14.9949 ≈15.0. That's correct.

So Star5 is 15.0, which is <16, so both can detect.

So the correct option is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but looking back, Star1 has apparent magnitude 15.5, which is below 16, so both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now, looking at the options, which one includes any two of these.

Option B is Star3 and Star5. Option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be detected by both. So the options don't include a choice that includes Star1 and Star3. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing Star1. Let me check Star1's parameters again.

Star1: absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m = M +5 log10(10) -5=15.5 +5 -5=15.5. So apparent magnitude is 15.5. No extinction mentioned, so m=15.5. So both can detect it.

But looking at the options, the options are A, B, C, D, which are combinations given.

So which stars are in the options that can be detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both can.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can, Star4 cannot.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \cdot 1 - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), which is ≤16.  
   - **Conclusion**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 \) is >16, so it cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO (since \( m \leq 17 \)).  
   - **Conclusion**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The given apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) is already the observed magnitude (including extinction).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \).  
   - **Conclusion**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude (without extinction):  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \cdot 1 - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude (including extinction):  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so it cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO (since \( m \leq 17 \)).  
   - **Conclusion**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(5) - 5
     \]  
     \[
     \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897 \implies 5 \cdot \log_{10}(5) \approx 3.4949
     \]  
     \[
     m = 16.5 + 3.4949 - 5 = 14.9949 \approx 15.0
     \]  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \).  
   - **Conclusion**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**. 

**Correct Option**: B) Star3 and Star5.

Answer: B
