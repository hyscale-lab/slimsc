Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one. Hmm.

Wait, first, I remember that in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh, right, and the problem gives E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² * E. That simplifies things a bit.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, right? Because they're spin-1/2, which are fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n. But wait, because they are spin-1/2 particles, each state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So each energy level (each n) can have a maximum of two particles.

Wait, but how does this affect the ordering? Let me think. So for four particles, I need to fill up the energy levels with two particles each until I have four.

So the ground state is the lowest energy, then the first excited, then second excited.

Let me start by listing the energy levels, each corresponding to n=1, 2, 3, etc.

Since each level can hold two particles, let's see:

- n=1: can hold 2 particles
- n=2: can hold another 2 particles
But wait, four particles total, so n=1 and n=2 can each hold two, that's four. So that would be the ground state: all four particles in n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

Wait, no, wait. No, no—wait, each level can take two particles. So n=1 would have two, n=2 would have two, but that's four. So the ground state is when all four are filled in the lowest possible n's.

Wait, but maybe the way the energy levels are filled depends on the order. So the first level is n=1, then n=2, etc. Each can hold two particles. So for four particles, we'd need to fill n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but for identical particles, each in their own state. So each particle in n=1 has energy E_1 = 1² E = E. Each in n=2 has E_2 = 4E. But since each n can have two particles, four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, but wait, that's all the particles in the lowest two energy levels. But wait, the question is about the ground state, first excited, second excited. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the system's state.

Wait, no. The question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So the system's energy levels are determined by the possible combinations of the individual particles' states, considering the exclusion principle.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Each particle is in a state with a certain n. Since they're fermions, each must have a unique combination of quantum numbers. But in 1D, the quantum number is just n, and since spin is 1/2, each state can have two particles (spin up and down). So the possible n's are filled starting from the lowest.

So with four particles, we'll need to fill n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles), and then n=3 would be empty in the ground state. Wait, no, four particles would fill n=1 (2), n=2 (2), so that's all.

So the ground state of the system would have all four particles in the lowest possible n's, so two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E = 10E.

Wait, but the question is about the ground state, first excited, and second excited of the entire system. Wait, no, the question says: "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E."

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The system's ground state is the state with the lowest possible energy. The first excited state is the next higher energy, and so on.

But considering that each particle's state is determined by their n and spin, and for four particles, the possible states are built by distributing the particles across the lowest possible energy levels, considering the spin.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Since each n can hold two particles due to spin, the system's overall energy is the sum of the individual particles' energies arranged in the lowest possible way.

So for four particles:

- The first two go into n=1 (each with spin up and down), and the next two go into n=2. So the energies for each particle are E1 and E2.

Wait, but if each particle must have a unique quantum state, then for four particles, we have n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles), and n=3 would be higher, but no particles there.

So the system's ground state energy is 2*(E1) + 2*(E2) = 2E + 8E =10E.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, it's n=1 with two and n=2 with two. So the energies would be E1 (n=1) and E2 (n=2). So the system's total energy is 2E1 + 2E2 = 2E + 8E=10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait. The question lists the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So maybe the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible energy levels. But perhaps the system's energy has higher states when particles are in higher n's.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the way the energies are calculated. Let me think about the possible states.

Wait, the four fermions must occupy the lowest possible energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion. So the ground state would have the two lowest n's filled, each with two particles. So n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles).

So system's energy is 2E + 8E=10E.

Then, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher state. But wait, but in the lowest possible energy. Wait, maybe it's when one particle is promoted to the next available state, which is n=3.

But n=3 can take two particles. So if I promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=2 already has two particles, so you can't have more than two. So perhaps the first excited state would have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but no, because each n can hold two, so perhaps in the first excited state, n=2 is filled (two), and n=3 is partially filled (two). But wait, four particles, so n=1 has two, n=2 has two. If I promote one from n=2 to n=3, that would leave n=2 with one, and n=3 with one. But that's not possible because each can hold up to two. So perhaps the next possible configuration is when n=1 has two, n=2 has one, and n=3 has one. But wait, but that would leave n=4 with zero. Hmm, no, wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, that's four particles.

Wait, but in that case, the energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, but each particle's energy is n² E, so n=3 is 9E.

Wait, but wait a second, that's not the correct way to think about it. Because when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, the total energy increases. So the ground state is 10E, as calculated before.

But how do the excited states come about? Let's think about possible configurations.

- Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 2E + 8E = 10E.

But wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible arrangement, which would be n=1 and n=2 filled. So this gives 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. What's the next possible? Perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3, but then you can't have two because n=3 would only have one, but wait, because each n can hold two, so perhaps the next state is when n=3 is filled with two particles. But wait, that would require four particles? No, because n=1 is two, n=3 is two. So that's four, so total energy is 2E + 18E=20E.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if n=1 is two, n=2 is zero, and n=3 is two, that's four particles. But is that a lower energy than other possible configurations? Wait, earlier I thought the ground state had n=2 filled as well, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available orbitals, each with two particles. So first, n=1 has two particles, then n=2 has two particles. That's four, so the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E.

But wait, maybe another configuration is possible where the particles are arranged in a higher way. For example, if all four are in n=1, but that's not possible because each n can only hold two particles. So for four particles, you must have at least two n's filled.

Wait, but wait, no. Since each n can hold up to two, the minimum number of n's is two: n=1 (two) and n=2 (two).

So the ground state is 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to the next available n, but n=2 is already filled. So perhaps the next available is n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). Wait, but each n can hold two, so if n=2 has one, it can take another. So perhaps the first excited state is when n=2 has two, n=3 has two, but that's four particles. So that would be 8E + 18E =26E. But that's higher than the ground state. Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). So the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) = 2+4+9=15E.

Wait, but wait, that's only three particles. Oh, because four particles. So perhaps the fourth is in n=3 as well. But then n=3 would have two particles, and n=2 has two, but that's back to 10E again. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible states as the system's energy levels. The system will have energy levels based on how the four particles are arranged, considering the exclusion principle.

Another approach is to consider that each particle must have a unique quantum state. So for four fermions, each must have a unique (n, spin) combination. Since each n can have two (spin up and down), the first two will go into n=1, the next two into n=2.

So the system's ground state energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Wait, but that's what I calculated earlier. So the ground state is 10E.

What about the first excited state? To find the first excited energy, perhaps one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's only three particles. Oh no, wait, I have four particles. So perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So that's four particles. The total is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but wait, but n=2 can hold two. So if I have two in n=1, two in n=2, that's the ground state. If I move one from n=2 to n=3, then I have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That's four. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

So the ground state is 10E, the first excited is 15E, and the next is what?

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and the remaining two are in n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But that's higher than 15E, so perhaps 15E is the first excited state, and 20E is the second.

Wait, but now I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

The ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be the next lowest possible energy. So what's the next configuration after all particles are in the lowest possible n's.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, so we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That gives a total energy of 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps two in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. Wait, but that's four particles. So the second excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but wait, maybe the first excited state is when all four are in the same n? No, that's not possible because each n can hold two particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=1 and one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two, so that's not allowed. So the first excited state is when two are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Which gives 15E.

Then the second excited state would be when two are in n=1 and two are in n=3. So energy 2E + 18E=20E.

But wait, the options don't have 20E. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 30E, 39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, option C says ground state 4E, first excited 10, second excited 15. But according to my earlier calculation, ground state is 10E. So I think the options might think differently.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the configuration. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles. So four particles would be in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). So that's the ground state, 2E +8E=10E.

Thus, the ground state is 10E. So the first excited state is when the configuration changes. What's the next possible arrangement?

Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. So the first excited state is 15E, and the second is 18E.

Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E=15E. The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. But that's not an option.

Wait, but looking at option D, the second excited state is 18E. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (two). Then the energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than 15E, so 15E would be a lower excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=1 and one in n=2. But no, n=1 can only hold two. So that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the approach is wrong. Let me think about the possible allowed states for four fermions in a 1D box.

Each fermion must have a unique (n, spin). So for n=1, spin up and down → two particles. For n=2, same → two more. So four particles in n=1 and n=2. So ground state energy is 2E + 8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Let's think: perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, each n can hold two, so perhaps the first excited state is when one more particle is in n=3, but that would require moving another from n=2. So for four particles, two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but that's higher than the previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the fermions can have different n's as long as their quantum numbers are unique. So maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=2 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the ground state is the lowest possible, and the first excited state is when the next possible energy level is filled.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's energy levels are built by considering each particle's state, but the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. So the ground state is when the four particles are in the lowest possible orbitals, which is n=1 and n=2.

In that case, the ground state energy is 2E (n=1) + 8E (n=2) =10E.

The first excited state would be when one particle moves to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=3, so two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, but option D says ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But 18E would be the case when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2, which would be 8E (n=2) + 18E (n=3) =26E. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others as in ground state. So 2E (n=1) +8E (n=2) +9E (n=3) → but that's three particles, so where's the fourth? Oh, wait, no, because each n can hold two. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's four particles. So energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The next excited state (second excited state) would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering that each particle in a higher n would contribute more energy. So perhaps the ground state is 10E, the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 20E. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 4E,10E,15E → That would imply the ground state is 4E. How?

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in n=1? But that's impossible because each n can hold two particles. So only two can be in n=1, the other two must go to higher n's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ground state calculation.

Wait, maybe each particle in the same n must have a unique spin, so two per n. So for four particles, the lowest configuration is two in n=1 and two in n=2, which gives a total energy of 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Thus, in the options, the ground state is 10E, which is present in options B, C, D.

Looking at option B: 4E, 10E,50E. Hmm, 4E would be 2*(2E), which would be two particles in n=2. But that can't be the ground state, since n=1 is lower.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. So ground state is 4E. That would mean two particles in n=2, and two elsewhere. But that's not the ground state. So option C's ground state is 4E can't be correct.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E. So ground state 10E. That matches our calculation.

But according to the earlier calculation, the first excited state would be 15E, and the second excited state would be 20E, but option D's second excited state is 18E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing another scenario. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So energy is 8E + 18E=26E. But that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps the way the system's energy is calculated isn't just the sum of each particle's energy, but perhaps the system's energy is determined by the highest occupied energy level. But no, that's not right. The total energy is the sum of all particles' energies.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

If the four particles are arranged as two in n=1 and two in n=2, that's 10E.

Then, the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

So the energies would be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited:15E

Second excited:20E

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm wrong about the second excited state.

Wait, looking at option D: second excited is 18E. So how could that be?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=2 can only hold two.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 18E. No, that's higher than 15E.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when all four are in n=2. But that's not possible because n=2 can hold two.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that each fermion in a state must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin. So perhaps the way the particles are arranged is such that in the first excited state, two are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, but this gives 15E. Then, the second excited state is when we have two in n=1, two in n=3, which gives 20E.

But again, this isn't matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Let me think again. The ground state is when the four particles are in the lowest possible n's. So two in n=1 (2E) and two in n=2 (8E), total 10E. So that's correct.

So the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. Now, two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, two in n=3. So the total is 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the answer isn't matching any of the options. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly about the possible states. Let me think about the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, considering the exclusion principle.

The possible states are:

- All four in n=1 and n=2, with two each. So energy 10E.

- Two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy 2E + 18E=20E.

- Two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy 15E.

- One in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But no, since each n can hold two.

Wait, no, that's not possible because n=2 can hold two, so perhaps the first excited state is two in n=1, two in n=3, giving 20E.

But that's higher than 15E, which would be the first excited state.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again:

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

So, ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So, 18E would come from where? Let's think. Suppose the system's second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So energy is 8E +18E=26E.

No, that's higher than 18E. So perhaps 18E is when three particles are in n=2, but that's not allowed since n=2 can only hold two.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one in n=4. But that's even higher. So that can't be.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's five particles, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has two particles in n=2 and two in n=3, but that's four particles. So energy is 8E + 18E=26E. But that's not matching anything.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that requires five particles, which isn't possible. So I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the system's energy as the sum of individual energies, which isn't correct. No, that's how it should be.

Wait, perhaps the options are considering each energy level as a multiple, but I'm not considering that the particles can have higher spin states. But no, spin is 1/2, so each state can have two particles.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a configuration where the particles are arranged in a way that doesn't involve all of them being in the lowest n's. For example, maybe the first excited state has two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, which gives 15E, and the second excited state has two in n=1, two in n=3, which gives 20E.

But that's not matching the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has 10E, 15E,18E. But where does 18E come from?

Wait, 18E is n=4 (since n=4 would be 16E), no, wait n=4 is 16E. 18E would be n= sqrt(18) which is not an integer. No, wait, n must be integer. So 18E would be n= sqrt(18)=~4.24, but that's not possible. So 18E can't be the energy of a single particle. So perhaps it's the sum of particles in n=2 and n=4.

Wait, but n=4 would have E=16E per particle. So if two particles are in n=4, that's 32E. But that's way higher than 18E.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 (9E) and the others as in the ground state. So total energy is 10E (ground) + (9E-4E)=5E → 15E. So that's the first excited state. Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making the energy 2E (n=1) + 8E (n=2) → no, wait, if two are in n=3, that's 2*9E=18E. So the total would be 2E +18E=20E.

But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible answer.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So the energies would be 10,15,18.

How could that happen? Let's see:

Ground state: 2*(1²E) +2*(2²E) =2E+8E=10E.

First excited state: 2*(1²E) +1*(2²E) +1*(3²E) =2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: How to get 18E. Maybe 1*(1²E) +2*(2²E) +1*(4²E). So 1E +8E +16E=25E, which isn't 18E.

Alternatively, 1*(1²E) +1*(2²E) +2*(3²E) =1E +4E +18E=23E. No, that's not 18E.

Hmm, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two are in n=4. But that's 18E +32E=50E, which is option A.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So the energy is 2*(9E)=18E. But that's only considering those two, but the other two are in n=1. So total is 2E +18E=20E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible options again.

The only option that has 10E as the ground state is option D and B.

Option B has 4E as ground state, which can't be correct.

So option D is the only one with ground state as 10E.

So according to this, the correct answer should be option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

But how does 18E fit in? Because according to my earlier calculations, the second excited state would be 20E. So perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. Wait, no, that's five particles. So it's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=2. So energy is 2*(4E) +2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the other three are in higher n's, but that's more than four particles.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but looking at the options, the only option that fits the ground state as 10E, the first excited as 15E is option D, which has 18E as the second excited. So perhaps I'm missing something in the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3, which would give energy 8E + 18E=26E. But that's not in the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in the second excited state, one particle is in n=2 and three in n=3. But that's four particles, so 4E + 27E=31E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=1. So energy 2E + 18E =20E.

But again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 10E,15E,18E, even though I can't see how to get 18E. Because it's the only option with 10E as ground state, which I'm confident is correct.

So I'll go with option D.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we start by noting that the energy levels in such a well are quantized and given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E,
\]

where \(E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}\). Each quantum level \(n\) can hold a maximum of two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (Pauli exclusion principle). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of all particles.

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. Since each level can hold two particles, the configuration is:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) with energy \(E_1 = 1^2 E = E\),
- Two particles in \(n=2\) with energy \(E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E\).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) with energy \(E_1 = E\),
- One particle in \(n=2\) with energy \(E_2 = 4E\),
- One particle in \(n=3\) with energy \(E_3 = 9E\).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) with energy \(E_1 = E\),
- Two particles in \(n=3\) with energy \(E_3 = 9E\).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Matching with Options
The calculated energies are \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(20E\). However, none of the options directly match this result. Among the given options, **Option D** (\(10E\), \(15E\), \(18E\)) is the closest match, as it correctly identifies the ground state energy as \(10E\) and the first excited state as \(15E\). The discrepancy in the second excited state (\(18E\) instead of \(20E\)) may arise from a different interpretation of the configurations.

Thus, the best choice based on the given options is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one. Hmm.

Wait, first, I remember that in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh, right, and the problem gives E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² * E. That simplifies things a bit.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, right? Because they're spin-1/2, which are fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n. But wait, because they are spin-1/2 particles, each state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So each energy level (each n) can have a maximum of two particles.

Wait, but how does this affect the ordering? Let me think. So for four particles, I need to fill up the energy levels with two particles each until I have four.

So the ground state is the lowest energy, then the first excited, then second excited.

Let me start by listing the energy levels, each corresponding to n=1, 2, 3, etc.

Since each level can hold two particles, let's see:

- n=1: can hold 2 particles
- n=2: can hold another 2 particles
But wait, four particles total, so n=1 and n=2 can each hold two, that's four. So that would be the ground state: all four particles in n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

Wait, no, wait. No, no—wait, each level can take two particles. So n=1 would have two, n=2 would have two, but that's four. So the ground state is when all four are filled in the lowest possible n's.

Wait, but maybe the way the energy levels are filled depends on the order. So the first level is n=1, then n=2, etc. Each can hold two particles. So for four particles, we'd need to fill n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but for identical particles, each in their own state. So each particle in n=1 has energy E_1 = 1² E = E. Each in n=2 has E_2 = 4E. But since each n can have two particles, four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, but wait, that's all the particles in the lowest two energy levels. But wait, the question is about the ground state, first excited, second excited. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the system's state.

Wait, no. The question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So the system's energy levels are determined by the possible combinations of the individual particles' states, considering the exclusion principle.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Each particle is in a state with a certain n. Since they're fermions, each must have a unique combination of quantum numbers. But in 1D, the quantum number is just n, and since spin is 1/2, each state can have two particles (spin up and down). So the possible n's are filled starting from the lowest.

So with four particles, we'll need to fill n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles), and then n=3 would be empty in the ground state. Wait, no, four particles would fill n=1 (2), n=2 (2), so that's all.

So the ground state of the system would have all four particles in the lowest possible n's, so two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E = 10E.

Wait, but the question is about the ground state, first excited, and second excited of the entire system. Wait, no, the question says: "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E."

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The system's ground state is the state with the lowest possible energy. The first excited state is the next higher energy, and so on.

But considering that each particle's state is determined by their n and spin, and for four particles, the possible states are built by distributing the particles across the lowest possible energy levels, considering the spin.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Since each n can hold two particles due to spin, the system's overall energy is the sum of the individual particles' energies arranged in the lowest possible way.

So for four particles:

- The first two go into n=1 (each with spin up and down), and the next two go into n=2. So the energies for each particle are E1 and E2.

Wait, but if each particle must have a unique quantum state, then for four particles, we have n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles), and n=3 would be higher, but no particles there.

So the system's ground state energy is 2*(E1) + 2*(E2) = 2E + 8E =10E.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, it's n=1 with two and n=2 with two. So the energies would be E1 (n=1) and E2 (n=2). So the system's total energy is 2E1 + 2E2 = 2E + 8E=10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait. The question lists the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So maybe the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible energy levels. But perhaps the system's energy has higher states when particles are in higher n's.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the way the energies are calculated. Let me think about the possible states.

Wait, the four fermions must occupy the lowest possible energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion. So the ground state would have the two lowest n's filled, each with two particles. So n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles).

So system's energy is 2E + 8E=10E.

Then, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher state. But wait, but in the lowest possible energy. Wait, maybe it's when one particle is promoted to the next available state, which is n=3.

But n=3 can take two particles. So if I promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=2 already has two particles, so you can't have more than two. So perhaps the first excited state would have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but no, because each n can hold two, so perhaps in the first excited state, n=2 is filled (two), and n=3 is partially filled (two). But wait, four particles, so n=1 has two, n=2 has two. If I promote one from n=2 to n=3, that would leave n=2 with one, and n=3 with one. But that's not possible because each can hold up to two. So perhaps the next possible configuration is when n=1 has two, n=2 has one, and n=3 has one. But wait, but that would leave n=4 with zero. Hmm, no, wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, that's four particles.

Wait, but in that case, the energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Wait, but each particle's energy is n² E, so n=3 is 9E.

Wait, but wait a second, that's not the correct way to think about it. Because when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, the total energy increases. So the ground state is 10E, as calculated before.

But how do the excited states come about? Let's think about possible configurations.

- Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 2E + 8E = 10E.

But wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible arrangement, which would be n=1 and n=2 filled. So this gives 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. What's the next possible? Perhaps one particle is promoted to n=3, but then you can't have two because n=3 would only have one, but wait, because each n can hold two, so perhaps the next state is when n=3 is filled with two particles. But wait, that would require four particles? No, because n=1 is two, n=3 is two. So that's four, so total energy is 2E + 18E=20E.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if n=1 is two, n=2 is zero, and n=3 is two, that's four particles. But is that a lower energy than other possible configurations? Wait, earlier I thought the ground state had n=2 filled as well, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available orbitals, each with two particles. So first, n=1 has two particles, then n=2 has two particles. That's four, so the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E.

But wait, maybe another configuration is possible where the particles are arranged in a higher way. For example, if all four are in n=1, but that's not possible because each n can only hold two particles. So for four particles, you must have at least two n's filled.

Wait, but wait, no. Since each n can hold up to two, the minimum number of n's is two: n=1 (two) and n=2 (two).

So the ground state is 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to the next available n, but n=2 is already filled. So perhaps the next available is n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one). Wait, but each n can hold two, so if n=2 has one, it can take another. So perhaps the first excited state is when n=2 has two, n=3 has two, but that's four particles. So that would be 8E + 18E =26E. But that's higher than the ground state. Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). So the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) = 2+4+9=15E.

Wait, but wait, that's only three particles. Oh, because four particles. So perhaps the fourth is in n=3 as well. But then n=3 would have two particles, and n=2 has two, but that's back to 10E again. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible states as the system's energy levels. The system will have energy levels based on how the four particles are arranged, considering the exclusion principle.

Another approach is to consider that each particle must have a unique quantum state. So for four fermions, each must have a unique (n, spin) combination. Since each n can have two (spin up and down), the first two will go into n=1, the next two into n=2.

So the system's ground state energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Wait, but that's what I calculated earlier. So the ground state is 10E.

What about the first excited state? To find the first excited energy, perhaps one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's only three particles. Oh no, wait, I have four particles. So perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So that's four particles. The total is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but wait, but n=2 can hold two. So if I have two in n=1, two in n=2, that's the ground state. If I move one from n=2 to n=3, then I have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That's four. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

So the ground state is 10E, the first excited is 15E, and the next is what?

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and the remaining two are in n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But that's higher than 15E, so perhaps 15E is the first excited state, and 20E is the second.

Wait, but now I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

The ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be the next lowest possible energy. So what's the next configuration after all particles are in the lowest possible n's.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, so we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That gives a total energy of 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps two in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. Wait, but that's four particles. So the second excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but wait, maybe the first excited state is when all four are in the same n? No, that's not possible because each n can hold two particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=1 and one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two, so that's not allowed. So the first excited state is when two are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Which gives 15E.

Then the second excited state would be when two are in n=1 and two are in n=3. So energy 2E + 18E=20E.

But wait, the options don't have 20E. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 30E, 39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, option C says ground state 4E, first excited 10, second excited 15. But according to my earlier calculation, ground state is 10E. So I think the options might think differently.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the configuration. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles. So four particles would be in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). So that's the ground state, 2E +8E=10E.

Thus, the ground state is 10E. So the first excited state is when the configuration changes. What's the next possible arrangement?

Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. So the first excited state is 15E, and the second is 18E.

Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E=15E. The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. But that's not an option.

Wait, but looking at option D, the second excited state is 18E. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (two). Then the energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than 15E, so 15E would be a lower excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when three particles are in n=1 and one in n=2. But no, n=1 can only hold two. So that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the approach is wrong. Let me think about the possible allowed states for four fermions in a 1D box.

Each fermion must have a unique (n, spin). So for n=1, spin up and down → two particles. For n=2, same → two more. So four particles in n=1 and n=2. So ground state energy is 2E + 8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Let's think: perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But wait, each n can hold two, so perhaps the first excited state is when one more particle is in n=3, but that would require moving another from n=2. So for four particles, two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but that's higher than the previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the fermions can have different n's as long as their quantum numbers are unique. So maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=2 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the ground state is the lowest possible, and the first excited state is when the next possible energy level is filled.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's energy levels are built by considering each particle's state, but the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. So the ground state is when the four particles are in the lowest possible orbitals, which is n=1 and n=2.

In that case, the ground state energy is 2E (n=1) + 8E (n=2) =10E.

The first excited state would be when one particle moves to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=3, so two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, but option D says ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But 18E would be the case when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2, which would be 8E (n=2) + 18E (n=3) =26E. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others as in ground state. So 2E (n=1) +8E (n=2) +9E (n=3) → but that's three particles, so where's the fourth? Oh, wait, no, because each n can hold two. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But that's four particles. So energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The next excited state (second excited state) would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering that each particle in a higher n would contribute more energy. So perhaps the ground state is 10E, the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 20E. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 4E,10E,15E → That would imply the ground state is 4E. How?

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in n=1? But that's impossible because each n can hold two particles. So only two can be in n=1, the other two must go to higher n's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ground state calculation.

Wait, maybe each particle in the same n must have a unique spin, so two per n. So for four particles, the lowest configuration is two in n=1 and two in n=2, which gives a total energy of 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Thus, in the options, the ground state is 10E, which is present in options B, C, D.

Looking at option B: 4E, 10E,50E. Hmm, 4E would be 2*(2E), which would be two particles in n=2. But that can't be the ground state, since n=1 is lower.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. So ground state is 4E. That would mean two particles in n=2, and two elsewhere. But that's not the ground state. So option C's ground state is 4E can't be correct.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E. So ground state 10E. That matches our calculation.

But according to the earlier calculation, the first excited state would be 15E, and the second excited state would be 20E, but option D's second excited state is 18E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing another scenario. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So energy is 8E + 18E=26E. But that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps the way the system's energy is calculated isn't just the sum of each particle's energy, but perhaps the system's energy is determined by the highest occupied energy level. But no, that's not right. The total energy is the sum of all particles' energies.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

If the four particles are arranged as two in n=1 and two in n=2, that's 10E.

Then, the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

So the energies would be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited:15E

Second excited:20E

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm wrong about the second excited state.

Wait, looking at option D: second excited is 18E. So how could that be?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's not possible because n=2 can only hold two.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 18E. No, that's higher than 15E.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when all four are in n=2. But that's not possible because n=2 can hold two.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that each fermion in a state must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin. So perhaps the way the particles are arranged is such that in the first excited state, two are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, but this gives 15E. Then, the second excited state is when we have two in n=1, two in n=3, which gives 20E.

But again, this isn't matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Let me think again. The ground state is when the four particles are in the lowest possible n's. So two in n=1 (2E) and two in n=2 (8E), total 10E. So that's correct.

So the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. Now, two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, two in n=3. So the total is 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the answer isn't matching any of the options. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly about the possible states. Let me think about the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, considering the exclusion principle.

The possible states are:

- All four in n=1 and n=2, with two each. So energy 10E.

- Two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy 2E + 18E=20E.

- Two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy 15E.

- One in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But no, since each n can hold two.

Wait, no, that's not possible because n=2 can hold two, so perhaps the first excited state is two in n=1, two in n=3, giving 20E.

But that's higher than 15E, which would be the first excited state.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again:

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

So, ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So, 18E would come from where? Let's think. Suppose the system's second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So energy is 8E +18E=26E.

No, that's higher than 18E. So perhaps 18E is when three particles are in n=2, but that's not allowed since n=2 can only hold two.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one in n=4. But that's even higher. So that can't be.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's five particles, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has two particles in n=2 and two in n=3, but that's four particles. So energy is 8E + 18E=26E. But that's not matching anything.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that requires five particles, which isn't possible. So I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the system's energy as the sum of individual energies, which isn't correct. No, that's how it should be.

Wait, perhaps the options are considering each energy level as a multiple, but I'm not considering that the particles can have higher spin states. But no, spin is 1/2, so each state can have two particles.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a configuration where the particles are arranged in a way that doesn't involve all of them being in the lowest n's. For example, maybe the first excited state has two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, which gives 15E, and the second excited state has two in n=1, two in n=3, which gives 20E.

But that's not matching the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has 10E, 15E,18E. But where does 18E come from?

Wait, 18E is n=4 (since n=4 would be 16E), no, wait n=4 is 16E. 18E would be n= sqrt(18) which is not an integer. No, wait, n must be integer. So 18E would be n= sqrt(18)=~4.24, but that's not possible. So 18E can't be the energy of a single particle. So perhaps it's the sum of particles in n=2 and n=4.

Wait, but n=4 would have E=16E per particle. So if two particles are in n=4, that's 32E. But that's way higher than 18E.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 (9E) and the others as in the ground state. So total energy is 10E (ground) + (9E-4E)=5E → 15E. So that's the first excited state. Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making the energy 2E (n=1) + 8E (n=2) → no, wait, if two are in n=3, that's 2*9E=18E. So the total would be 2E +18E=20E.

But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible answer.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So the energies would be 10,15,18.

How could that happen? Let's see:

Ground state: 2*(1²E) +2*(2²E) =2E+8E=10E.

First excited state: 2*(1²E) +1*(2²E) +1*(3²E) =2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: How to get 18E. Maybe 1*(1²E) +2*(2²E) +1*(4²E). So 1E +8E +16E=25E, which isn't 18E.

Alternatively, 1*(1²E) +1*(2²E) +2*(3²E) =1E +4E +18E=23E. No, that's not 18E.

Hmm, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two are in n=4. But that's 18E +32E=50E, which is option A.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So the energy is 2*(9E)=18E. But that's only considering those two, but the other two are in n=1. So total is 2E +18E=20E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible options again.

The only option that has 10E as the ground state is option D and B.

Option B has 4E as ground state, which can't be correct.

So option D is the only one with ground state as 10E.

So according to this, the correct answer should be option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

But how does 18E fit in? Because according to my earlier calculations, the second excited state would be 20E. So perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. Wait, no, that's five particles. So it's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=2. So energy is 2*(4E) +2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the other three are in higher n's, but that's more than four particles.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but looking at the options, the only option that fits the ground state as 10E, the first excited as 15E is option D, which has 18E as the second excited. So perhaps I'm missing something in the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3, which would give energy 8E + 18E=26E. But that's not in the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in the second excited state, one particle is in n=2 and three in n=3. But that's four particles, so 4E + 27E=31E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=1. So energy 2E + 18E =20E.

But again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 10E,15E,18E, even though I can't see how to get 18E. Because it's the only option with 10E as ground state, which I'm confident is correct.

So I'll go with option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we start by noting that the energy levels in such a well are quantized and given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E,
\]

where \(E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}\). Each quantum level \(n\) can hold a maximum of two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (Pauli exclusion principle). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of all particles.

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. Since each level can hold two particles, the configuration is:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) with energy \(E_1 = 1^2 E = E\),
- Two particles in \(n=2\) with energy \(E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E\).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) with energy \(E_1 = E\),
- One particle in \(n=2\) with energy \(E_2 = 4E\),
- One particle in \(n=3\) with energy \(E_3 = 9E\).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) with energy \(E_1 = E\),
- Two particles in \(n=3\) with energy \(E_3 = 9E\).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Matching with Options
The calculated energies are \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(20E\). However, none of the options directly match this result. Among the given options, **Option D** (\(10E\), \(15E\), \(18E\)) is the closest match, as it correctly identifies the ground state energy as \(10E\) and the first excited state as \(15E\). The discrepancy in the second excited state (\(18E\) instead of \(20E\)) may arise from a different interpretation of the configurations.

Thus, the best choice based on the given options is:

**Answer: D**
