Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. Hmm, the question says that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. So, the gene structure is split into these exons and introns. The sequencing was done on the target gene in all mutants, and the changes are in the first exon area. 

Wait, so the first exon is where the mutations occurred. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations here could affect the protein structure. The goal is to find a mutation that stops the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a loss-of-function mutation.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different sequence. The intact gene is given, and the mutants have changes in the first exon. I think I need to compare the mutants' sequences to see which one causes a significant change in the amino acids produced.

Let me write down the sequences:

Intact:
ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, looking at the first part. The intact starts with ATG TTT CTC... Mutant 1 has CTAC instead of TCTC. Oh wait, let me see the exact changes.

Wait, perhaps I should look for changes that cause a frameshift or a premature stop codon. Frameshifts can mess up the entire reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, a point mutation that changes an amino acid might not be as effective unless it disrupts a critical function.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: First exon. Let's see the exact change. The first part of the sequence is:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing exon 1: Let's look at the first few codons.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write the sequences as triplets to see codons.

Wait, the sequences are given as long strings, so I need to split each into codons (groups of three) to see the amino acids.

Intact: 

First part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

So codons are:
ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), T... etc.

Mutant 1:

ATG TTT CT ACG T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

Wait, perhaps the actual change is in the third codon. Let me compare:

In the intact, the third codon is TTT. In Mutant 1, the third codon is TCT? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the sequences are longer and I'm trying to parse them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note where the changes are.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact:
... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant 1:
... TCT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, so the change in Mutant 1 is in the third codon. Let's see:

In intact, it's TTT CTC GCT.

In Mutant 1, it's TCT ACG GCT.

So the first three codons after ATG are:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu) in intact.

In Mutant 1, it's ATG, TTT, CT ACG? Wait, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong.

Wait, the intact first part is:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1's first part is:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So, aligning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, so in Mutant 1, the third nucleotide in the second codon (which was TTT) is now a T, so the second codon becomes TCT instead of TTT. Wait no, wait the letters: Let me look at the exact letters.

The intact starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, the first few letters:

Intact: Position 3: TTT... (so after ATG, the next three are TTT, then CTC, etc.)

Mutant1: ATG TTT C T ACG... Wait, no, perhaps I should break it into triplets.

Wait, the start codon is ATG. Then the next three nucleotides are TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), etc.

In Mutant 1, after ATG, the next three are TTT, then CTA (Leu?), then CGC (Arg?), maybe. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to look for a frameshift. If the mutation is an insertion or deletion causing the reading frame to shift, that would lead to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, potentially leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: Ends with ...TCGT... but the intact ends with ...TCGT... so maybe the change is somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the sequences differ.

In the first exon, the mutant sequences differ from the intact. Let's compare Mutant1:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the change is at the sixth, seventh, and eighth nucleotides? Let me line them up:

Intact: T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

Mutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

So the fourth, fifth, and sixth nucleotides in that segment: in intact, it's C G C, in Mutant1, it's A C G.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the nucleotides.

Wait, the intact has C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's look at the nucleotide differences for each mutant.

Mutant1: In the first exon, the sequence changes from 'CTCGCT' to 'CTACGC'.

Wait, that's perhaps a substitution of nucleotides in the middle of the exon. So, that's a point mutation. Let's see what that does to the codons.

The original sequence (exon 1) in that region:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the original sequence is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the first part is CT CGC TGG TAC T...

In Mutant1, it's CT ACG CTG GTAC T...

Wait, that changes the second codon in that segment. So, in the original, the codons were CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mutant1, the codon changes from CTC to CTA (Leu?), then the next codon from GCT to CGC (Arg), and so on.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in triplets.

Original codons:
- CTC: Leu
- GCT: Ala
- GGT: Gly
- ACT: Thr
- TCT: Ser
- GTG: Val
- GAT: Asp

In Mutant1, the changes are:

Original sequence: ... CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...
Mutant1: ... CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the first codon after change is CTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then GGT (Gly), same as before, etc.

So the amino acids would change from Leu, Ala, Gly, ... to Leu, Arg, Gly, ...

So, a change from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC). So that's a substitution. But would that disrupt the protein enough to eliminate the compound? Maybe not.

Mutant 2:

Mutant2's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing to the intact:

Intact: ... TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant2: ... TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the change is from CTCGCT to TAAGCT.

Let me split into codons.

Original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant2: TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the first codon after the change would be CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), next is GGT (Gly), etc.

Wait, no, in Mutant2, the change is in the sequence: so in the intact, it's CTC GCT, but in Mutant2, it's TAA GCT?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the nucleotides. Let me see:

Intact: ... T T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G ...

Mutant2: ... T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G ...

So, the change is in the middle of the exon. Let me see: The intact has CTC GCT, and Mutant2 has TAA GCT.

So, the first codon is TCT (Ser) instead of CTC (Leu?), wait no, wait the first few nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me write out the sequence for the first exon in each mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon.

Let's check each mutant for any early stop codons.

The original gene's reading frame continues until TGA at the end. So any mutation introducing a TAA, TAG, or TGA would create a stop codon.

Looking for where in the mutants a stop codon appears.

Mutant 1:

Looking at the end of the sequence, it ends with ...TCGC...TGA. The intact ends with ...TCGT...TGA.

So, in Mutant1, the last part before TGA is GTCGC, which would be GTC (Val), GC (but wait, it's the triplet before TGA. Wait, the reading frame would be ...GTC G... or something else? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a stop codon in any of the mutants.

Looking at Mutant4:

Mutant4's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact:

Intact: ... TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ... TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, in the first exon, the sequence changes from CTC GCT GGT to TAC GCT ACT.

So, the codons would be:

Original: CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc.

Hmm, so the first codon changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). That's a substitution, but no stop codon.

Wait, but looking further, does Mutant4 have any new stop codons?

The original gene's first codon is ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), etc.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the start codon is ATG, then the next codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc.

Wait, so the first few codons are normal except for TAC instead of CTC. No stop codon introduced here. So, maybe the protein is still made but with a different start?

Wait, no, the start codon is still ATG. So, the protein starts, but the second codon is now Tyr instead of Phe. Not a stop codon.

Mutant3:

Mutant3's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact:

Intact: ... TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3: ... TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the change is in the first exon. Let's break into codons.

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the third codon was CTC (Leu) in the original, now it's TAC (Tyr). Then the fourth codon: GCT (Ala) becomes GCT (Ala) again? Or wait, perhaps the sequence is TAC GCT.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the exact positions wrong. Let me count the letters:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the first codon after TTT is CTC (Leu) in intact. In Mutant3, it's TAC (Tyr). Then the next codon in intact was GCT (Ala), in Mutant3 it's GCT (Ala) as well. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, let me line up the sequences.

Intact after ATG:
TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3 after ATG:
TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, the first codon is TTT (same), then CTC becomes TAC. So, that's Leu -> Tyr. Then GCT remains GCT (Ala), then GGT -> GGT (Gly), then ACT -> ACT (Thr), then TCT -> TCT (Ser), etc.

Hmm, no stop codon introduced. So, the protein would be altered but not terminated early.

Wait, but looking further on, let's see if any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.

Looking at Mutant 4's sequence again:

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, codons after ATG: TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT...

ACT is Thr, TCT is Ser, GTG is Val, GAT is Asp. No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4 has a larger deletion. Let me check the length.

Intact: ... ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

Mutant4: ... ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

So, perhaps Mutant4 is missing some nucleotides. Let me count the letters.

Intact's first exon in that region is longer. For example, intact has CT CGC TGG TAC T, while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4's sequence is shorter, leading to a frameshift. Let me compare the lengths.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence has a deletion. For example, in the intact, the part is "CTCGCTGGTACT", which is 12 nucleotides (4 codons). In Mutant4, it's "TACGCTACTTCT", which is 12 as well. Hmm, same length. So no frameshift. So, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, maybe in Mutant4, after ATG, the sequence is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc. No stop codon. So, it's a missense mutation but doesn't lead to a premature stop.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: which mutation leads to a frameshift, causing a completely different downstream amino acid sequence and possibly a nonfunctional protein?

Looking for insertions or deletions that are not multiples of three, causing a frameshift.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: No obvious change in length. The sequence seems to have substitutions but same length, so no frameshift.

Mutant2: Let's see. The sequence in the first exon is changed from CTCGCT to TAAGCT. So, the length remains the same (6 nucleotides before and after). So, no frameshift.

Mutant3: The sequence changes from CTCGCTGGTAC to TACGCTGGTGTCA. Wait, perhaps same length.

Mutant4: The first part is TTTTACGCTACT... same length as the original.

So, perhaps none of the mutants have a frameshift. So, the alternative is that one of them has a nonsense mutation, introducing a stop codon.

Looking again:

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking at each mutant's sequence for these.

Mutant1's sequence ends with ...GTCGC...TGA. The TGA is the stop codon at the end, same as the intact.

Mutant2's sequence ends with ...GTCGC...TGA. Same as intact.

Mutant3's sequence ends with ...GTCGT...TGA. Same stop, so no new stop.

Mutant4's sequence ends with ...GTCGT...TGA. Same as intact.

Hmm, so none of the mutations introduce a new stop codon before the original TGA.

Wait, unless one of the mutations creates a stop codon in the middle.

Looking at Mutant1's sequence:

After the change, what's the sequence?

Mutant1: ...ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA...

So, looking at the codons:

ATG, TTT, TCT, ACG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAA, TAT, TTA, TGC...

Wait, TGC is a codon for Cys. But is there any new stop codon in the middle?

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: the question says that the gene has five exons and four introns. So the first exon is the first part. The changes are in the first exon, so perhaps the mutation is in a critical region, like the start codon or an important functional domain.

Wait, looking for changes in the start codon. The start codon is ATG. All the mutants start with ATG, so the start codon is intact.

Hmm, so the mutations are in the coding region. The goal is to eliminate the compound, so we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

In that case, a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) would likely disrupt the gene. But none of the mutations seem to introduce a stop codon before the original TGA, except for the original TGA.

Wait, another possibility: a missense mutation that disrupts a critical functional site, like an enzyme active site.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's function by a premature stop codon, but none of the options introduce that. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation disrupts the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each mutant for possible in-frame stop codons.

Wait, looking at Mutant4: Let me parse the entire sequence.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

After ATG, the sequence is:

TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

So codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), TGC (Cys), GT (wait, but that's the end before TGA? No, wait, the sequence is longer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the letters for Mutant4:

The entire sequence starts with ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, that's more than the original, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 has a larger deletion. Let me compare the lengths of the sequences.

The intact sequence in that region is longer. Let me count the number of nucleotides before the stop codon.

Intact: ... ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Mutant4: ... ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Hmm, perhaps they have the same length, so no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe one of the mutations changes a critical codon that is essential for the enzyme's function. For example, if the mutation creates a stop codon, the protein is truncated and likely nonfunctional.

But looking again, all the stop codons are at the end, same as the original.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of a null allele, which completely inactivates the gene. One way to achieve this is a frameshift leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the point of mutation onward, often resulting in a nonfunctional protein.

But I thought none of the mutants had a frameshift.

Wait, let me check Mutant4 again. The original sequence in that region is:

... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant4's sequence there is:

... TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the first change is from CTC to TAC. CTC is Leu, TAC is Tyr.

Wait, but perhaps the mutation is an insertion or deletion elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. Let me think about each option.

The options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

The question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests a loss-of-function mutation.

Which mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene product? A frameshift would cause a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, likely leading to a nonfunctional protein. But if all the mutations are substitutions, then maybe none cause a frameshift, but perhaps one causes a premature stop elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should check for any in-frame stop codons.

Wait, let's think about each mutant's sequence.

Mutant1:

After the change, the codons after ATG are TTT, TCT, ACG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc.

Wait, any of these codons a stop? No. TCT is Ser, ACG is Thr, GCT is Ala, etc.

Mutant2:

After ATG, the codons are TTT, TCT, TAA, GCT, GGT, ACT, etc.

Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh! So in Mutant2, the codon changes to TAA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, let me re-examine Mutant2's sequence.

Mutant2's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, after the start codon ATG, the sequence is TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should split it into triplets.

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, that can't be right because the triplet after TTT would be CTA (Leu), then AGC (Ser), then TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc.

Wait, wait, perhaps the sequence is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the codons are ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Wait, but in Mutant2, the sequence after ATG is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), the fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), eighth is GTG (Val), ninth is GAT (Asp), etc.

Wait, so after CTA, the next codon is AGC. So, no stop codon introduced here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reading frame wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the sequence in Mutant2 introduces a TAA in the same frame.

Wait, another approach: let's look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence.

In Mutant2:

After the start codon, the sequence is TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Looking for TAA: Let's see, the codons are TTT, CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. No TAA, TAG, or TGA except at the end.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me check Mutant2's sequence again.

Mutant2’s sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me break this into triplets:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, the sequence TGC is Cys, TGT is Cys, CGT is Arg. No stop codons except at the end.

Hmm, so maybe none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation disrupts a critical region, such as the start codon or a critical functional domain, such as the active site of an enzyme.

But all the mutations are in the first exon, so perhaps the region is critical for the gene's function.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is pointing towards a missense mutation that changes a critical amino acid, leading to a loss of function.

But without knowing which amino acid is critical, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which has a major change in the exon, leading to a frameshift. Wait, no, earlier analysis suggested no frameshift.

Wait, maybe I should think about the position of the mutation. The first exon is early in the gene, so a frameshift here would affect the entire downstream sequence, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

So, if a mutation causes a frameshift in the first exon, the entire protein would be altered, leading to a loss of function.

Looking again, perhaps Mutant4 has a deletion or insertion that causes a frameshift.

Wait, let me count the number of nucleotides in the first exon region for each mutant.

In the intact, the first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, that's 27 nucleotides (9 codons).

Mutant4's first part is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, same number of nucleotides, so no frameshift.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think about the nature of the changes.

Mutant4's sequence in the first exon changes from CTCGCTGGTACT to TACGCTACT.

Wait, perhaps that's a change from CTC GCT GGT ACT to TAC GCT ACT.

So, the codons change from CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr) to TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc.

So, the change is in the third codon: from CTC to TAC.

So, that codon changes from Leu to Tyr.

That's a missense mutation. Could that disrupt the function of the protein?

Possibly, if that position is critical. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the right approach is to look for a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon, which would terminate translation early, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking again, perhaps I missed a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, looking at Mutant2’s sequence: after ATG, the second codon is TTT (Phe), third is TCT (Ser), fourth is AAG (Lys?), fifth is CTT (Leu), etc. No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all the possibilities and choose the most probable.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests a mutation that disrupts the gene function.

Frameshifts and nonsense mutations are more likely to cause loss of function. Since none of the mutations seem to cause a frameshift, perhaps the answer is the one with a substitution leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the only option with a substitution leading to a stop codon is Mutant2.

Wait, earlier I thought Mutant2's sequence introduces a TAA stop codon. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine.

Mutant2's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, the fourth codon is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), etc.

No TAA, TAG, or TGA except the last one.

So, no. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the options.

The options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

The question states that the gene has 5 exons and 4 introns. So, the first exon is the first part of the gene. The mutations are in the first exon.

The goal is to eliminate the compound, so we need a gene that is not functional.

The best way is a mutation that creates a stop codon early in the gene, so the protein is truncated and nonfunctional.

Looking for where any of the mutants introduce a stop codon.

Wait, in Mutant2's sequence, after the ATG, the sequence is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), the fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, unless I'm missing something.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4. Because in its sequence, the codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Then, the following codon is GCT (Ala) which remains the same. But perhaps this leads to a situation where the protein's structure is altered in a way that disrupts the synthesis of the compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a frameshift, but I don't see any in the mutants.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a substitution that changes a codon to a stop codon. Let me see:

Mutant1:

The third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is ACG (Thr), fifth is GCT (Ala). No stop.

Mutant2:

CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop.

Mutant3:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), etc. No stop.

Mutant4:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc. No stop.

So, none of the mutations introduce a stop codon early. Therefore, the only way for the gene to be nonfunctional is via a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

But without knowing which amino acid is critical, it's hard to choose.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation is a nonsense mutation. Looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in reading Mutant2's sequence.

Wait, let me recheck Mutant2's sequence.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), etc. No stop codons.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, because looking at the sequence:

Mutant4: ... TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which is a change from the original CTC (Leu). Maybe this changes an amino acid in a critical region, leading to loss of function.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the sequence.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the anti-nutritional compound is due to the gene's product. If the gene is knocked out, the compound won't be synthesized.

The best way to knock out the gene is to have a frameshift or a stop codon early in the gene.

But in the given options, I don't see any stop codons introduced except the original one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier with Mutant2. Let me check again.

Mutant2's sequence after ATG is TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the third codon is CTA (Leu), the fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), eighth is GTG (Val), ninth is GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons. So, perhaps none of the mutants introduce a stop codon.

In that case, the best bet is a missense mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Which mutation changes a codon in a way that disrupts the protein's function.

Looking at the options, Mutant4 changes from CTC GCT GGT ACT to TAC GCT ACT.

So, the third codon becomes TAC (Tyr), changing from CTC (Leu). That's a significant change. Suppose this position is critical for the enzyme's function, it could disrupt the synthesis.

Alternatively, Mutant1 changes CTC GCT to CT ACG.

So, the third codon becomes CT ACG (CG?), but I'm probably getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4's change leads to a shorter protein if a stop codon was introduced, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 leads to a frameshift because the substitution changes the reading frame. But that's unlikely since the substitution is a point mutation, not an insertion or deletion.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes from CTC GCT GGT ACT to TAC GCT ACT, which is a shorter sequence? No, same length.

Hmm.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is multiple-choice, and the options are A to D. Based on the sequences, the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function. The way to do that is to have a mutation that introduces a stop codon early.

But from my analysis, none of the mutations do that. So perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, assuming it disrupts a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the start codon. If the mutation is in the start codon, the protein won't be made. But all the mutants have ATG as the start codon.

Another approach: all the mutants have a mutation in the first exon. The first exon is often where the start codon is. So, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 changes the reading frame, but that's not the case as the length is same.

I'm a bit stuck. Based on the initial analysis, perhaps the best option is Mutant4, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the first exon's sequence in a way that disrupts the gene's function, leading to no compound production.

I think I'll go with Mutant4 as the correct answer. So, the option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein's structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `CTA` and `GCT` to `CGC`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Leu, Ala → Arg) but do not introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift. The protein is likely still functional.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `CTA` and `GCT` to `AGC`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Leu, Ala → Ser) but do not introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift. The protein is likely still functional.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `TAC` and `GGT` to `GTC`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Tyr, Gly → Val) but do not introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift. The protein is likely still functional.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `TAC` and `GCT` to `ACT`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Tyr, Ala → Thr). While no premature stop codon is introduced, the significant alteration in the early region of the gene could disrupt the protein's structure or function, potentially eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 4** introduces the most significant changes in the first exon, which could disrupt the gene's function and lead to the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound. While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, Mutant 4's alterations are most likely to interfere with the protein's critical functions.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. Hmm, the question says that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. So, the gene structure is split into these exons and introns. The sequencing was done on the target gene in all mutants, and the changes are in the first exon area. 

Wait, so the first exon is where the mutations occurred. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations here could affect the protein structure. The goal is to find a mutation that stops the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a loss-of-function mutation.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different sequence. The intact gene is given, and the mutants have changes in the first exon. I think I need to compare the mutants' sequences to see which one causes a significant change in the amino acids produced.

Let me write down the sequences:

Intact:
ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, looking at the first part. The intact starts with ATG TTT CTC... Mutant 1 has CTAC instead of TCTC. Oh wait, let me see the exact changes.

Wait, perhaps I should look for changes that cause a frameshift or a premature stop codon. Frameshifts can mess up the entire reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, a point mutation that changes an amino acid might not be as effective unless it disrupts a critical function.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: First exon. Let's see the exact change. The first part of the sequence is:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing exon 1: Let's look at the first few codons.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write the sequences as triplets to see codons.

Wait, the sequences are given as long strings, so I need to split each into codons (groups of three) to see the amino acids.

Intact: 

First part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

So codons are:
ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), T... etc.

Mutant 1:

ATG TTT CT ACG T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

Wait, perhaps the actual change is in the third codon. Let me compare:

In the intact, the third codon is TTT. In Mutant 1, the third codon is TCT? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the sequences are longer and I'm trying to parse them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note where the changes are.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact:
... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant 1:
... TCT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, so the change in Mutant 1 is in the third codon. Let's see:

In intact, it's TTT CTC GCT.

In Mutant 1, it's TCT ACG GCT.

So the first three codons after ATG are:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu) in intact.

In Mutant 1, it's ATG, TTT, CT ACG? Wait, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong.

Wait, the intact first part is:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1's first part is:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So, aligning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, so in Mutant 1, the third nucleotide in the second codon (which was TTT) is now a T, so the second codon becomes TCT instead of TTT. Wait no, wait the letters: Let me look at the exact letters.

The intact starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, the first few letters:

Intact: Position 3: TTT... (so after ATG, the next three are TTT, then CTC, etc.)

Mutant1: ATG TTT C T ACG... Wait, no, perhaps I should break it into triplets.

Wait, the start codon is ATG. Then the next three nucleotides are TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), etc.

In Mutant 1, after ATG, the next three are TTT, then CTA (Leu?), then CGC (Arg?), maybe. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to look for a frameshift. If the mutation is an insertion or deletion causing the reading frame to shift, that would lead to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, potentially leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: Ends with ...TCGT... but the intact ends with ...TCGT... so maybe the change is somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the sequences differ.

In the first exon, the mutant sequences differ from the intact. Let's compare Mutant1:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the change is at the sixth, seventh, and eighth nucleotides? Let me line them up:

Intact: T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

Mutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

So the fourth, fifth, and sixth nucleotides in that segment: in intact, it's C G C, in Mutant1, it's A C G.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the nucleotides.

Wait, the intact has C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's look at the nucleotide differences for each mutant.

Mutant1: In the first exon, the sequence changes from 'CTCGCT' to 'CTACGC'.

Wait, that's perhaps a substitution of nucleotides in the middle of the exon. So, that's a point mutation. Let's see what that does to the codons.

The original sequence (exon 1) in that region:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the original sequence is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the first part is CT CGC TGG TAC T...

In Mutant1, it's CT ACG CTG GTAC T...

Wait, that changes the second codon in that segment. So, in the original, the codons were CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mutant1, the codon changes from CTC to CTA (Leu?), then the next codon from GCT to CGC (Arg), and so on.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in triplets.

Original codons:
- CTC: Leu
- GCT: Ala
- GGT: Gly
- ACT: Thr
- TCT: Ser
- GTG: Val
- GAT: Asp

In Mutant1, the changes are:

Original sequence: ... CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...
Mutant1: ... CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the first codon after change is CTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then GGT (Gly), same as before, etc.

So the amino acids would change from Leu, Ala, Gly, ... to Leu, Arg, Gly, ...

So, a change from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC). So that's a substitution. But would that disrupt the protein enough to eliminate the compound? Maybe not.

Mutant 2:

Mutant2's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing to the intact:

Intact: ... TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant2: ... TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the change is from CTCGCT to TAAGCT.

Let me split into codons.

Original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant2: TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the first codon after the change would be CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), next is GGT (Gly), etc.

Wait, no, in Mutant2, the change is in the sequence: so in the intact, it's CTC GCT, but in Mutant2, it's TAA GCT?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the nucleotides. Let me see:

Intact: ... T T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G ...

Mutant2: ... T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G ...

So, the change is in the middle of the exon. Let me see: The intact has CTC GCT, and Mutant2 has TAA GCT.

So, the first codon is TCT (Ser) instead of CTC (Leu?), wait no, wait the first few nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me write out the sequence for the first exon in each mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon.

Let's check each mutant for any early stop codons.

The original gene's reading frame continues until TGA at the end. So any mutation introducing a TAA, TAG, or TGA would create a stop codon.

Looking for where in the mutants a stop codon appears.

Mutant 1:

Looking at the end of the sequence, it ends with ...TCGC...TGA. The intact ends with ...TCGT...TGA.

So, in Mutant1, the last part before TGA is GTCGC, which would be GTC (Val), GC (but wait, it's the triplet before TGA. Wait, the reading frame would be ...GTC G... or something else? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a stop codon in any of the mutants.

Looking at Mutant4:

Mutant4's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact:

Intact: ... TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ... TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, in the first exon, the sequence changes from CTC GCT GGT to TAC GCT ACT.

So, the codons would be:

Original: CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc.

Hmm, so the first codon changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). That's a substitution, but no stop codon.

Wait, but looking further, does Mutant4 have any new stop codons?

The original gene's first codon is ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), etc.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the start codon is ATG, then the next codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc.

Wait, so the first few codons are normal except for TAC instead of CTC. No stop codon introduced here. So, maybe the protein is still made but with a different start?

Wait, no, the start codon is still ATG. So, the protein starts, but the second codon is now Tyr instead of Phe. Not a stop codon.

Mutant3:

Mutant3's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact:

Intact: ... TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3: ... TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the change is in the first exon. Let's break into codons.

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the third codon was CTC (Leu) in the original, now it's TAC (Tyr). Then the fourth codon: GCT (Ala) becomes GCT (Ala) again? Or wait, perhaps the sequence is TAC GCT.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the exact positions wrong. Let me count the letters:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the first codon after TTT is CTC (Leu) in intact. In Mutant3, it's TAC (Tyr). Then the next codon in intact was GCT (Ala), in Mutant3 it's GCT (Ala) as well. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, let me line up the sequences.

Intact after ATG:
TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3 after ATG:
TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, the first codon is TTT (same), then CTC becomes TAC. So, that's Leu -> Tyr. Then GCT remains GCT (Ala), then GGT -> GGT (Gly), then ACT -> ACT (Thr), then TCT -> TCT (Ser), etc.

Hmm, no stop codon introduced. So, the protein would be altered but not terminated early.

Wait, but looking further on, let's see if any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.

Looking at Mutant 4's sequence again:

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, codons after ATG: TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT...

ACT is Thr, TCT is Ser, GTG is Val, GAT is Asp. No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4 has a larger deletion. Let me check the length.

Intact: ... ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

Mutant4: ... ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

So, perhaps Mutant4 is missing some nucleotides. Let me count the letters.

Intact's first exon in that region is longer. For example, intact has CT CGC TGG TAC T, while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4's sequence is shorter, leading to a frameshift. Let me compare the lengths.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence has a deletion. For example, in the intact, the part is "CTCGCTGGTACT", which is 12 nucleotides (4 codons). In Mutant4, it's "TACGCTACTTCT", which is 12 as well. Hmm, same length. So no frameshift. So, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, maybe in Mutant4, after ATG, the sequence is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc. No stop codon. So, it's a missense mutation but doesn't lead to a premature stop.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: which mutation leads to a frameshift, causing a completely different downstream amino acid sequence and possibly a nonfunctional protein?

Looking for insertions or deletions that are not multiples of three, causing a frameshift.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: No obvious change in length. The sequence seems to have substitutions but same length, so no frameshift.

Mutant2: Let's see. The sequence in the first exon is changed from CTCGCT to TAAGCT. So, the length remains the same (6 nucleotides before and after). So, no frameshift.

Mutant3: The sequence changes from CTCGCTGGTAC to TACGCTGGTGTCA. Wait, perhaps same length.

Mutant4: The first part is TTTTACGCTACT... same length as the original.

So, perhaps none of the mutants have a frameshift. So, the alternative is that one of them has a nonsense mutation, introducing a stop codon.

Looking again:

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking at each mutant's sequence for these.

Mutant1's sequence ends with ...GTCGC...TGA. The TGA is the stop codon at the end, same as the intact.

Mutant2's sequence ends with ...GTCGC...TGA. Same as intact.

Mutant3's sequence ends with ...GTCGT...TGA. Same stop, so no new stop.

Mutant4's sequence ends with ...GTCGT...TGA. Same as intact.

Hmm, so none of the mutations introduce a new stop codon before the original TGA.

Wait, unless one of the mutations creates a stop codon in the middle.

Looking at Mutant1's sequence:

After the change, what's the sequence?

Mutant1: ...ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA...

So, looking at the codons:

ATG, TTT, TCT, ACG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAA, TAT, TTA, TGC...

Wait, TGC is a codon for Cys. But is there any new stop codon in the middle?

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: the question says that the gene has five exons and four introns. So the first exon is the first part. The changes are in the first exon, so perhaps the mutation is in a critical region, like the start codon or an important functional domain.

Wait, looking for changes in the start codon. The start codon is ATG. All the mutants start with ATG, so the start codon is intact.

Hmm, so the mutations are in the coding region. The goal is to eliminate the compound, so we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

In that case, a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) would likely disrupt the gene. But none of the mutations seem to introduce a stop codon before the original TGA, except for the original TGA.

Wait, another possibility: a missense mutation that disrupts a critical functional site, like an enzyme active site.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's function by a premature stop codon, but none of the options introduce that. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation disrupts the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each mutant for possible in-frame stop codons.

Wait, looking at Mutant4: Let me parse the entire sequence.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

After ATG, the sequence is:

TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA T...

So codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), TGC (Cys), GT (wait, but that's the end before TGA? No, wait, the sequence is longer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the letters for Mutant4:

The entire sequence starts with ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, that's more than the original, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 has a larger deletion. Let me compare the lengths of the sequences.

The intact sequence in that region is longer. Let me count the number of nucleotides before the stop codon.

Intact: ... ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Mutant4: ... ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Hmm, perhaps they have the same length, so no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe one of the mutations changes a critical codon that is essential for the enzyme's function. For example, if the mutation creates a stop codon, the protein is truncated and likely nonfunctional.

But looking again, all the stop codons are at the end, same as the original.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of a null allele, which completely inactivates the gene. One way to achieve this is a frameshift leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the point of mutation onward, often resulting in a nonfunctional protein.

But I thought none of the mutants had a frameshift.

Wait, let me check Mutant4 again. The original sequence in that region is:

... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant4's sequence there is:

... TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the first change is from CTC to TAC. CTC is Leu, TAC is Tyr.

Wait, but perhaps the mutation is an insertion or deletion elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. Let me think about each option.

The options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

The question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests a loss-of-function mutation.

Which mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene product? A frameshift would cause a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, likely leading to a nonfunctional protein. But if all the mutations are substitutions, then maybe none cause a frameshift, but perhaps one causes a premature stop elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should check for any in-frame stop codons.

Wait, let's think about each mutant's sequence.

Mutant1:

After the change, the codons after ATG are TTT, TCT, ACG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc.

Wait, any of these codons a stop? No. TCT is Ser, ACG is Thr, GCT is Ala, etc.

Mutant2:

After ATG, the codons are TTT, TCT, TAA, GCT, GGT, ACT, etc.

Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh! So in Mutant2, the codon changes to TAA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, let me re-examine Mutant2's sequence.

Mutant2's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, after the start codon ATG, the sequence is TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should split it into triplets.

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, that can't be right because the triplet after TTT would be CTA (Leu), then AGC (Ser), then TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc.

Wait, wait, perhaps the sequence is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the codons are ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Wait, but in Mutant2, the sequence after ATG is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), the fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), eighth is GTG (Val), ninth is GAT (Asp), etc.

Wait, so after CTA, the next codon is AGC. So, no stop codon introduced here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reading frame wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the sequence in Mutant2 introduces a TAA in the same frame.

Wait, another approach: let's look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence.

In Mutant2:

After the start codon, the sequence is TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Looking for TAA: Let's see, the codons are TTT, CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. No TAA, TAG, or TGA except at the end.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me check Mutant2's sequence again.

Mutant2’s sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me break this into triplets:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, the sequence TGC is Cys, TGT is Cys, CGT is Arg. No stop codons except at the end.

Hmm, so maybe none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation disrupts a critical region, such as the start codon or a critical functional domain, such as the active site of an enzyme.

But all the mutations are in the first exon, so perhaps the region is critical for the gene's function.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is pointing towards a missense mutation that changes a critical amino acid, leading to a loss of function.

But without knowing which amino acid is critical, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which has a major change in the exon, leading to a frameshift. Wait, no, earlier analysis suggested no frameshift.

Wait, maybe I should think about the position of the mutation. The first exon is early in the gene, so a frameshift here would affect the entire downstream sequence, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

So, if a mutation causes a frameshift in the first exon, the entire protein would be altered, leading to a loss of function.

Looking again, perhaps Mutant4 has a deletion or insertion that causes a frameshift.

Wait, let me count the number of nucleotides in the first exon region for each mutant.

In the intact, the first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, that's 27 nucleotides (9 codons).

Mutant4's first part is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, same number of nucleotides, so no frameshift.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think about the nature of the changes.

Mutant4's sequence in the first exon changes from CTCGCTGGTACT to TACGCTACT.

Wait, perhaps that's a change from CTC GCT GGT ACT to TAC GCT ACT.

So, the codons change from CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr) to TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc.

So, the change is in the third codon: from CTC to TAC.

So, that codon changes from Leu to Tyr.

That's a missense mutation. Could that disrupt the function of the protein?

Possibly, if that position is critical. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the right approach is to look for a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon, which would terminate translation early, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking again, perhaps I missed a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, looking at Mutant2’s sequence: after ATG, the second codon is TTT (Phe), third is TCT (Ser), fourth is AAG (Lys?), fifth is CTT (Leu), etc. No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all the possibilities and choose the most probable.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests a mutation that disrupts the gene function.

Frameshifts and nonsense mutations are more likely to cause loss of function. Since none of the mutations seem to cause a frameshift, perhaps the answer is the one with a substitution leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the only option with a substitution leading to a stop codon is Mutant2.

Wait, earlier I thought Mutant2's sequence introduces a TAA stop codon. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine.

Mutant2's sequence is:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, the fourth codon is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), etc.

No TAA, TAG, or TGA except the last one.

So, no. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the options.

The options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

The question states that the gene has 5 exons and 4 introns. So, the first exon is the first part of the gene. The mutations are in the first exon.

The goal is to eliminate the compound, so we need a gene that is not functional.

The best way is a mutation that creates a stop codon early in the gene, so the protein is truncated and nonfunctional.

Looking for where any of the mutants introduce a stop codon.

Wait, in Mutant2's sequence, after the ATG, the sequence is:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), the fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, unless I'm missing something.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4. Because in its sequence, the codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Then, the following codon is GCT (Ala) which remains the same. But perhaps this leads to a situation where the protein's structure is altered in a way that disrupts the synthesis of the compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a frameshift, but I don't see any in the mutants.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a substitution that changes a codon to a stop codon. Let me see:

Mutant1:

The third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is ACG (Thr), fifth is GCT (Ala). No stop.

Mutant2:

CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop.

Mutant3:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), etc. No stop.

Mutant4:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc. No stop.

So, none of the mutations introduce a stop codon early. Therefore, the only way for the gene to be nonfunctional is via a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

But without knowing which amino acid is critical, it's hard to choose.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation is a nonsense mutation. Looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in reading Mutant2's sequence.

Wait, let me recheck Mutant2's sequence.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC TGT CGT … TGA.

So, the third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), etc. No stop codons.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, because looking at the sequence:

Mutant4: ... TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which is a change from the original CTC (Leu). Maybe this changes an amino acid in a critical region, leading to loss of function.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the sequence.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the anti-nutritional compound is due to the gene's product. If the gene is knocked out, the compound won't be synthesized.

The best way to knock out the gene is to have a frameshift or a stop codon early in the gene.

But in the given options, I don't see any stop codons introduced except the original one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier with Mutant2. Let me check again.

Mutant2's sequence after ATG is TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the third codon is CTA (Leu), the fourth is AGC (Ser), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh is TCT (Ser), eighth is GTG (Val), ninth is GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons. So, perhaps none of the mutants introduce a stop codon.

In that case, the best bet is a missense mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Which mutation changes a codon in a way that disrupts the protein's function.

Looking at the options, Mutant4 changes from CTC GCT GGT ACT to TAC GCT ACT.

So, the third codon becomes TAC (Tyr), changing from CTC (Leu). That's a significant change. Suppose this position is critical for the enzyme's function, it could disrupt the synthesis.

Alternatively, Mutant1 changes CTC GCT to CT ACG.

So, the third codon becomes CT ACG (CG?), but I'm probably getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4's change leads to a shorter protein if a stop codon was introduced, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 leads to a frameshift because the substitution changes the reading frame. But that's unlikely since the substitution is a point mutation, not an insertion or deletion.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes from CTC GCT GGT ACT to TAC GCT ACT, which is a shorter sequence? No, same length.

Hmm.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is multiple-choice, and the options are A to D. Based on the sequences, the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function. The way to do that is to have a mutation that introduces a stop codon early.

But from my analysis, none of the mutations do that. So perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, assuming it disrupts a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the start codon. If the mutation is in the start codon, the protein won't be made. But all the mutants have ATG as the start codon.

Another approach: all the mutants have a mutation in the first exon. The first exon is often where the start codon is. So, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 changes the reading frame, but that's not the case as the length is same.

I'm a bit stuck. Based on the initial analysis, perhaps the best option is Mutant4, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the first exon's sequence in a way that disrupts the gene's function, leading to no compound production.

I think I'll go with Mutant4 as the correct answer. So, the option is D.


To determine which mutation most probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein's structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `CTA` and `GCT` to `CGC`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Leu, Ala → Arg) but do not introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift. The protein is likely still functional.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `CTA` and `GCT` to `AGC`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Leu, Ala → Ser) but do not introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift. The protein is likely still functional.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `TAC` and `GGT` to `GTC`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Tyr, Gly → Val) but do not introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift. The protein is likely still functional.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`
   - Changes: Substitutions in the first exon, altering codons such as `CTC` to `TAC` and `GCT` to `ACT`. These changes result in amino acid substitutions (e.g., Leu → Tyr, Ala → Thr). While no premature stop codon is introduced, the significant alteration in the early region of the gene could disrupt the protein's structure or function, potentially eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 4** introduces the most significant changes in the first exon, which could disrupt the gene's function and lead to the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound. While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, Mutant 4's alterations are most likely to interfere with the protein's critical functions.
