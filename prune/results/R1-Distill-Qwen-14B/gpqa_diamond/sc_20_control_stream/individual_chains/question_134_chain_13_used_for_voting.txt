Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kJ/mol, and for strong acids and bases, it's roughly around -57 kJ/mol per mole of H+ neutralized. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is also a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Wait, but H2SO4 is diprotic, right? So each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. And Ba(OH)2, I think, is a strong base that dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

The first thing I need to do is figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present in each solution. Because the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ (or OH- since they're in a 1:1 ratio in the reaction).

Let's calculate each solution's contribution.

Starting with HCl: It's a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+.

Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. So that's 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, Ba(OH)2: It's a base. Each mole gives 2 OH-. Concentration is 0.5 M, volume 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. So moles of OH- are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but wait. When you mix these, the H+ and OH- will react. So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. The total OH- is 0.2 mol. So which one is in excess?

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here is OH- because 0.2 < 0.28. So all the OH- will be neutralized, and there will be some H+ left over.

So moles of H+ neutralized = 0.2 mol. Each mole of H+ gives off about -57 kJ (or is it per mole of H2O formed? Because each mole of H+ and OH- makes one mole of H2O. So the enthalpy change is per mole of H2O, which is approximately -57 kJ/mol).

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each H+ comes from the acid and each OH- from the base). So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ. So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, so the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options have things in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48 kJ (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Hmm, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should recheck my calculations.

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait, no, wait. The question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. Wait, but the problem is mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and then see which is the limiting one.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH- to form 0.2 mol of H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

So the enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ neutralized. Each mole of H+ gives about -57 kJ, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is about 2.73 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). Wait, no, that's the other way. To get kcal, divide kJ by 4.184.

So 11.4 kJ ÷ 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So that would be about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Did I mix up the units? Because the options have kcal and kJ. So some options are in kcal, others in kJ.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol. So 0.2 mol would be -11.4 kJ. So that's about -11.4 kJ. Looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So that would match option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why is the calculation giving me -11.4 kJ which is about -2.72 kcal, but none of the options have that in kJ. Wait, looking again: option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me think again. The total moles of H+ and OH- may not just be the sum. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

Total H+: 0.28 mol.

Total OH-: 0.2 mol.

So H+ will be in excess by 0.08 mol. The reaction between H+ and OH- will proceed until OH- is exhausted. So 0.2 mol of H+ will be neutralized, producing 0.2 mol of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72), so the answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but another approach: maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reactant. But I think I did that right. So then the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal, option A.

But wait, another thought: the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid or base. Wait, but for strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy change per mole of H+ is about -57 kJ. So that part should be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the solution involves considering the dilution, but I don't think so because the volumes are mixed, but the enthalpy is based on the moles reacting, not the concentration after mixing.

Wait, another point: when mixing HCl and H2SO4, they both contribute H+ to the solution, and Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles of H+ neutralized: 0.2, so enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So the answer should be option A.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.8 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.8). That doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem requires taking into account the stoichiometry of each acid and base. But I think I accounted for that correctly. H2SO4 gives two H+ per mole, and Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per mole.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the total H+ and OH- as if they would all react, but maybe the reaction doesn't proceed that way. Let me think about the neutralization process again.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total equivalents of acid and base.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → 0.1 equivalents.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 equivalents (since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 equivalents (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole, but in terms of equivalents, it's 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 equivalents. Wait, wait, no: Equivalents for base is moles of OH- × valence. Oh, wait, no: for neutralization, the equivalents of acid = equivalents of base.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of equivalents.

Equivalents of acid = sum of (moles × n) for each acid.

HCl: 0.1 mol × 1 = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 eq.

Total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Equivalents of base: Ba(OH)2 is giving OH-. Each mole gives 2 equivalents (since OH- has a charge of -1).

So moles of Ba(OH)2 × 2 = 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 eq.

So the acid equivalents are 0.28, base are 0.2. So the base is the limiting reagent.

So moles of H+ neutralized = 0.2 eq. So enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Which is about -2.72 kcal. So option A.

Wait, another way: perhaps the question expects the use of the formula for enthalpy change, considering the volumes and concentrations, but I think the approach I took is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ contributed by each solution:

1. **HCl (acid):**  
   HCl is monoprotic, so each mole contributes 1 H⁺.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (acid):**  
   H₂SO₄ is diprotic, so each mole contributes 2 H⁺.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (base):**  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions per mole.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, we calculate the total moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:  
- Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), and the limiting reagent is OH⁻ (0.2 mol). Thus, 0.2 mol of H⁺ will be neutralized, leaving 0.08 mol of unreacted H⁺.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized. Therefore, the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Converting to kcal (using \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \)):  
\[
\Delta H = \frac{-11.4 \, \text{kJ}}{4.184} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A**
