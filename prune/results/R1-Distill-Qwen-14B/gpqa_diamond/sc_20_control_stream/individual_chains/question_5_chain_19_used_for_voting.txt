Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a muon's momentum operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators have eigenvectors corresponding to their eigenvalues, which represent possible outcomes of measurements.

The problem says the operator is P, and the direction is an arbitrary vector n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I think the operator P is probably the spin operator here because the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which are typical for spin-1/2 particles like a muon. Oh wait, muons are leptons, and their spin is 1/2, yeah.

The question gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. Similarly for P_y and P_z, which are (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.

I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane would have a polar angle θ from the z-axis and zero azimuthal angle φ. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

The operator P for an arbitrary direction would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components. So P = n·(P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n lies in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down each component operator. 

Given:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix:

Matrix for P:
= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me do the multiplication:

First term (from n_x P_x):
sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = (ħ sinθ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Which is:
[ [0, ħ sinθ/2 ], [ ħ sinθ/2, 0 ] ]

Second term (from n_z P_z):
cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = (ħ cosθ /2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Which is:
[ [ ħ cosθ/2, 0 ], [0, -ħ cosθ/2 ] ]

Adding these two matrices together:
[ [ ħ cosθ/2 + 0, (ħ sinθ/2) + 0 ],
  [ (ħ sinθ/2 ) + 0, 0 - ħ cosθ/2 ] ]

So the resulting P matrix is:
(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The second term's diagonal elements are (ħ cosθ/2 and -ħ cosθ/2). The first term's diagonal is (0,0). So adding them, the top left is (ħ cosθ/2), top right is sinθ * ħ/2, bottom left same, bottom right is (-ħ cosθ/2). So yes, the P matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, I think I got that right. So the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Wait, wait. Let me write it as:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
             [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is given as +ħ/2.

So let me write: (P - λ I) |ψ> = 0

Compute P - λ I:

λ is ħ/2, so:

P - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
                      [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

Wait, let's compute each element.

Matrix P is (ħ/2)*[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]
So subtracting (ħ/2) I would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ-1, sinθ ],
         [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

We need to find non-trivial solutions (vectors) to this equation.

The determinant of (P - λ I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So let's compute the determinant of the matrix (P - λ I) without the (ħ/2) factor, because when we factor it out, the (ħ/2)^2 would be a common factor, but since we're setting the determinant to zero, the scaling doesn't affect the equation.

Wait, better compute the determinant properly.

Wait, the matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[cosθ-1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ-1]]. So the determinant is (ħ/2)^2 * [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)^2 ].

But since we are looking for eigenvalues, the determinant must be zero, so:

(ħ/2)^2 [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin²θ ] = 0

Compute the term inside the brackets:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ +1) + (cosθ +1) ?

Wait, let me multiply (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -cos²θ -cosθ + cosθ +1 = -cos²θ + 1

Wait:

Let me compute (a - b)(c + d) = a c + a d - b c -b d.

Wait, (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = cosθ*(-cosθ) + cosθ*(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1)

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1

Simplify: -cos²θ + 1.

So the first term is ( -cos²θ +1 )

Then subtract sin²θ: -cos²θ +1 - sin²θ.

But cos²θ + sin²θ =1, so substituting:

- (cos²θ + sin²θ ) +1 = -1 +1 =0.

Wait, so the determinant is zero. That makes sense because we're dealing with eigenvalues, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the determinant is (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin²θ.

Let me compute each part:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1 ) = -cos²θ +1.

Then subtract sin²θ:

- cos²θ +1 - sin²θ.

= (1 - cos²θ ) - sin²θ.

But 1 - cos²θ is sin²θ, so:

= sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So the determinant is zero, which is consistent because we're looking for an eigenvalue.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is singular, and we can find the eigenvector by finding the null space.

Let me write the matrix (P - λ I) without the (ħ/2) factor:

M = [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
       [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

We can write the equations M |ψ> = 0.

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 --> equation 1.

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 --> equation 2.

We have two equations, but they are linearly dependent because the determinant is zero.

Let me take equation 1 as the main equation.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 --> rearrange, (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b.

So a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So let's see:

a = [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = cot(theta/2) b.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ].

We can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but let me check equation 2 to see if it's consistent.

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

Substitute a = cot(theta/2) b.

sinθ * cot(theta/2) b + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

Factor out b:

sinθ cot(theta/2) - cosθ -1 =0.

Let me compute sinθ cot(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sinθ cot(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So equation becomes:

2 cos²(theta/2) - cosθ -1 =0.

But cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So substituting:

2 cos²(theta/2) - (2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ) -1 = 2 cos²(theta/2) -2 cos²(theta/2) +1 -1 =0.

Yes, equation 2 is satisfied. So the equations are consistent.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

Let me write the vector as [ cos(theta/2)/(sin(theta/2)), 1 ].

Wait, because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So the vector components are ( cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2 ), 1 )

The normalization factor is the square root of ( [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ]^2 + 1^2 ) = [ cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ] / sin²(theta/2) ) = 1 / sin²(theta/2).

So normalization factor is sqrt(1 / sin²(theta/2) ) ) = 1 / |sin(theta/2)|.

Assuming sin(theta/2) is positive (theta between 0 and pi), so normalization factor is 1/sin(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ] * [ sin(theta/2) / sqrt( cos²(theta/2)/sin²(theta/2) + 1 ) ) ] 

Wait, no, better approach: the components are a and b as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( (cot(theta/2))^2 + 1 )

But cot^2 +1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2). So the normalization factor is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) * 1 ]

Simplify:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So a = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

b = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait. Wait, the normalization factor is sin(theta/2), right?

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

b = 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

So the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), and the normalization is 1 because cos² + sin² =1.

Wait, that's correct?

Yes, because [ cos(theta/2) ]² + [ sin(theta/2) ]² =1.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's it.

But wait what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have a phase factor.

Wait, the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized, but the options include things like e^{i phi}.

Wait, our solution has ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is a real vector.

But what if the eigenvector has a phase factor? Let me think.

The general solution is any scalar multiple, including complex phases. But in our calculation, the eigenvector came out real because we started with real components. Hmm.

Wait, the operator P is Hermitian because it's an observable (momentum operator, or in this case, spin component operator). So its eigenvectors can be chosen to be real, I think.

Wait, but looking at the given matrices, P_x and P_y are Hermitian? Let's check.

P_x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]] is real and symmetric, so Hermitian.

P_y matrix: [[0,-i],[i,0]] is Hermitian because the conjugate transpose is the same. Because [0, -i; i, 0] is equal to its conjugate transpose.

So overall, P is Hermitian because it's a sum of Hermitian matrices multiplied by real coefficients (sinθ and cosθ are real). So P is Hermitian, which implies its eigenvectors can be taken as real.

So the eigenvector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is real, and it's a valid normalized eigenvector.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but not sure if it's relevant here.

Option D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors; that seems more like a spin-up or spin-down state in a particular direction but scaled, but in our case, the normalization is 1.

Option A includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector should be dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvectors are dimensionless because they are vectors in Hilbert space. So the options that have ħ (like A and D) are probably incorrect because the eigenvector shouldn't have units of ħ.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, we construct:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Thus:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \lambda | \psi \rangle
\]
where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue. Substituting $\vec{P}$, the matrix equation becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0
\]
\[
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]
Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2)$ and $b = 1$, we compute:
\[
\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is $\sin(\theta/2)$, and the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D**: Includes unnecessary scaling factors and is inconsistent with the derived result.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a muon's momentum operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators have eigenvectors corresponding to their eigenvalues, which represent possible outcomes of measurements.

The problem says the operator is P, and the direction is an arbitrary vector n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I think the operator P is probably the spin operator here because the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which are typical for spin-1/2 particles like a muon. Oh wait, muons are leptons, and their spin is 1/2, yeah.

The question gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. Similarly for P_y and P_z, which are (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.

I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane would have a polar angle θ from the z-axis and zero azimuthal angle φ. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

The operator P for an arbitrary direction would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components. So P = n·(P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n lies in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down each component operator. 

Given:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix:

Matrix for P:
= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me do the multiplication:

First term (from n_x P_x):
sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = (ħ sinθ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Which is:
[ [0, ħ sinθ/2 ], [ ħ sinθ/2, 0 ] ]

Second term (from n_z P_z):
cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = (ħ cosθ /2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Which is:
[ [ ħ cosθ/2, 0 ], [0, -ħ cosθ/2 ] ]

Adding these two matrices together:
[ [ ħ cosθ/2 + 0, (ħ sinθ/2) + 0 ],
  [ (ħ sinθ/2 ) + 0, 0 - ħ cosθ/2 ] ]

So the resulting P matrix is:
(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The second term's diagonal elements are (ħ cosθ/2 and -ħ cosθ/2). The first term's diagonal is (0,0). So adding them, the top left is (ħ cosθ/2), top right is sinθ * ħ/2, bottom left same, bottom right is (-ħ cosθ/2). So yes, the P matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, I think I got that right. So the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Wait, wait. Let me write it as:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
             [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is given as +ħ/2.

So let me write: (P - λ I) |ψ> = 0

Compute P - λ I:

λ is ħ/2, so:

P - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
                      [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

Wait, let's compute each element.

Matrix P is (ħ/2)*[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]
So subtracting (ħ/2) I would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ-1, sinθ ],
         [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

We need to find non-trivial solutions (vectors) to this equation.

The determinant of (P - λ I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So let's compute the determinant of the matrix (P - λ I) without the (ħ/2) factor, because when we factor it out, the (ħ/2)^2 would be a common factor, but since we're setting the determinant to zero, the scaling doesn't affect the equation.

Wait, better compute the determinant properly.

Wait, the matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[cosθ-1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ-1]]. So the determinant is (ħ/2)^2 * [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)^2 ].

But since we are looking for eigenvalues, the determinant must be zero, so:

(ħ/2)^2 [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin²θ ] = 0

Compute the term inside the brackets:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ +1) + (cosθ +1) ?

Wait, let me multiply (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -cos²θ -cosθ + cosθ +1 = -cos²θ + 1

Wait:

Let me compute (a - b)(c + d) = a c + a d - b c -b d.

Wait, (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = cosθ*(-cosθ) + cosθ*(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1)

= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1

Simplify: -cos²θ + 1.

So the first term is ( -cos²θ +1 )

Then subtract sin²θ: -cos²θ +1 - sin²θ.

But cos²θ + sin²θ =1, so substituting:

- (cos²θ + sin²θ ) +1 = -1 +1 =0.

Wait, so the determinant is zero. That makes sense because we're dealing with eigenvalues, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the determinant is (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin²θ.

Let me compute each part:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1 ) = -cos²θ +1.

Then subtract sin²θ:

- cos²θ +1 - sin²θ.

= (1 - cos²θ ) - sin²θ.

But 1 - cos²θ is sin²θ, so:

= sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So the determinant is zero, which is consistent because we're looking for an eigenvalue.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is singular, and we can find the eigenvector by finding the null space.

Let me write the matrix (P - λ I) without the (ħ/2) factor:

M = [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
       [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

We can write the equations M |ψ> = 0.

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 --> equation 1.

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 --> equation 2.

We have two equations, but they are linearly dependent because the determinant is zero.

Let me take equation 1 as the main equation.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 --> rearrange, (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b.

So a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So let's see:

a = [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = cot(theta/2) b.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ].

We can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but let me check equation 2 to see if it's consistent.

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

Substitute a = cot(theta/2) b.

sinθ * cot(theta/2) b + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

Factor out b:

sinθ cot(theta/2) - cosθ -1 =0.

Let me compute sinθ cot(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sinθ cot(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So equation becomes:

2 cos²(theta/2) - cosθ -1 =0.

But cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So substituting:

2 cos²(theta/2) - (2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ) -1 = 2 cos²(theta/2) -2 cos²(theta/2) +1 -1 =0.

Yes, equation 2 is satisfied. So the equations are consistent.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

Let me write the vector as [ cos(theta/2)/(sin(theta/2)), 1 ].

Wait, because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So the vector components are ( cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2 ), 1 )

The normalization factor is the square root of ( [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ]^2 + 1^2 ) = [ cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ] / sin²(theta/2) ) = 1 / sin²(theta/2).

So normalization factor is sqrt(1 / sin²(theta/2) ) ) = 1 / |sin(theta/2)|.

Assuming sin(theta/2) is positive (theta between 0 and pi), so normalization factor is 1/sin(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ] * [ sin(theta/2) / sqrt( cos²(theta/2)/sin²(theta/2) + 1 ) ) ] 

Wait, no, better approach: the components are a and b as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( (cot(theta/2))^2 + 1 )

But cot^2 +1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2). So the normalization factor is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) * 1 ]

Simplify:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So a = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

b = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait. Wait, the normalization factor is sin(theta/2), right?

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

b = 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

So the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), and the normalization is 1 because cos² + sin² =1.

Wait, that's correct?

Yes, because [ cos(theta/2) ]² + [ sin(theta/2) ]² =1.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's it.

But wait what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have a phase factor.

Wait, the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized, but the options include things like e^{i phi}.

Wait, our solution has ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is a real vector.

But what if the eigenvector has a phase factor? Let me think.

The general solution is any scalar multiple, including complex phases. But in our calculation, the eigenvector came out real because we started with real components. Hmm.

Wait, the operator P is Hermitian because it's an observable (momentum operator, or in this case, spin component operator). So its eigenvectors can be chosen to be real, I think.

Wait, but looking at the given matrices, P_x and P_y are Hermitian? Let's check.

P_x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]] is real and symmetric, so Hermitian.

P_y matrix: [[0,-i],[i,0]] is Hermitian because the conjugate transpose is the same. Because [0, -i; i, 0] is equal to its conjugate transpose.

So overall, P is Hermitian because it's a sum of Hermitian matrices multiplied by real coefficients (sinθ and cosθ are real). So P is Hermitian, which implies its eigenvectors can be taken as real.

So the eigenvector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is real, and it's a valid normalized eigenvector.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but not sure if it's relevant here.

Option D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors; that seems more like a spin-up or spin-down state in a particular direction but scaled, but in our case, the normalization is 1.

Option A includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvector should be dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvectors are dimensionless because they are vectors in Hilbert space. So the options that have ħ (like A and D) are probably incorrect because the eigenvector shouldn't have units of ħ.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are expressed as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, we construct:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Thus:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \lambda | \psi \rangle
\]
where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue. Substituting $\vec{P}$, the matrix equation becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0
\]
\[
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]
Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2)$ and $b = 1$, we compute:
\[
\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is $\sin(\theta/2)$, and the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D**: Includes unnecessary scaling factors and is inconsistent with the derived result.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
