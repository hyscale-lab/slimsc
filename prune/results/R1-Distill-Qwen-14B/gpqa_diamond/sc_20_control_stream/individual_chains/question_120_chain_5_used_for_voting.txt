Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of stars. Let me think about what I know.

Parallax, plx, is the apparent shift in a star's position due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is distance d = 1 / plx, where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If plx is 0.5, the distance is 2 parsecs, right?

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed probably means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So, the number of stars depends on the volume available up to a certain distance.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, it's not the total number of stars, but the number in a small change of plx, like between plx and plx + dplx.

Let me think about how distance relates to parallax. Since d = 1/plx, when plx increases, distance decreases, and vice versa. So, for stars with larger parallax, they are closer.

Now, if I have a small range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Let's see. d = 1/plx, so when plx changes by dplx, the distance changes by dd. Let me compute that. So, dd = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx times dplx. The derivative is -1/(plx^2), so dd ≈ (-1/plx^2) * dplx. But since we're looking at a small change, the negative sign just indicates the direction, but the magnitude is what's important. So, |dd| = (1/plx^2) * dplx.

Wait, but the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² * (number density) * dd. Since the number density is uniform, let's say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But in terms of parallax, I can express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, d = 1/plx. So, substituting d into the expression.

So, number of stars (N) per unit distance dd is:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me make sure I get the substitution right. The shell's thickness is dd, which is (1/plx²) dplx. So, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² * (dd). So substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx, we get:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me calculate that again. d is 1/plx, so d squared is (1/plx)^2. Then, dd is (1/plx^2) dplx. So, putting it all together:

N = n * 4π * (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

Wait, that would be n*4π * (1/(plx^4)) dplx. Oh, but wait, that's the number of stars per unit change in plx, right? Because dplx is the change in parallax.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, so it's like N/(dplx) would give the number per unit plx. No, wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So in other words, it's N per dplx. So N is the number in a range dplx, so N/(dplx) would be the density. Or wait, no: the question says "number of stars per unit range of plx", which is N per dplx. So from my earlier equation, N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx. So,

N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number per unit plx (dplx) is N / dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, but this would imply that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). But that's not matching any of the options, except option A is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Another approach: The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is the same as the number of stars at distance d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in distance for a change dplx.

So, number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² * n * dd.

But since d = 1/plx, then dd = (d dplx) * (-1)/plx². The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're considering magnitude, dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, we get:

N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * n * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Which simplifies to N = 4 π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit change in plx (i.e., N per dplx) is 4 π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/(plx^4), which is option A.

But wait, another approach: considering the volume element. The number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr, where r is the distance.

Since r = 1/plx, dr = (d plx)/ (plx²). So, substituting:

Volume element = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx²) = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars in this volume (assuming uniform density) is 4 π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So per unit plx, it's 4 π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 1/plx^4

B) ~ 1/plx^2

C) ~ 1/plx^1

D) ~1/plx^3

So, A is the correct option.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), where \( d \) is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the thickness \( dd \) in terms of plx is \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume element, the number of stars in the shell becomes:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx},
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars. Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of plx is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This matches option A.
