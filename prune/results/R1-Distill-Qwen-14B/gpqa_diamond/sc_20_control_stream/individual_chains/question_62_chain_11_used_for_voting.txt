Okay, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I should probably think about the target molecule. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, that means there are two cyclohexane rings. One has a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) attached, and the other is connected via a CH(OH) group. Wait, actually, the structure is cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl connected via a CH2 group, which has an OH and a methyl group? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me draw this out mentally.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane. Then, the substituent at position 1 (which would be adjacent to the aldehyde group?) is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl ring and has an OH group on it. So, the structure is like a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde, and at position 1, a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected via a methylene group (CH2) that has an OH. So, it's something like cyclohexyl-CH(OH)- attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a CHO group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, it's CH2-C≡CH connected to a cyclohexane ring.

I think the synthesis will involve several steps, perhaps including functional group transformations and some cyclopropane or cyclohexane forming reactions.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reagents. Let me think about what each reagent does.

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride could be an alkylating agent. So maybe a nucleophilic substitution? Like forming a new carbon chain.

Option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in liquid NH3; then O3 and H2O; then NH4OH.

Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, like in Birch reductions or for forming Grignard-like reagents. Ozone followed by workup (like with H2O and then NH4OH) is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

H2/Pd-CaCO3 is hydrogenation, maybe reducing triple bonds to single bonds or alkenes. Ozone with (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would break ozonides into aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li in liquid NH3; O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Methanol as an alkylation agent? Maybe forming an ether or something else. Li and NH3 could be for deprotonation or ring-opening.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Triple bond. So, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate it to form an alkyne with a good leaving group. Or maybe form a longer chain.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. If you have ethynylcyclohexane and treat it with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, that's an alkylation. But wait, NaNH2 is a base, so maybe deprotonating the alkyne? Or maybe it's a Grignard-type addition.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (since it's -C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). Deprotonating with a strong base like NaNH2 would give the cyclohexyl acetylide ion. Then, methyl chloride could alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So, the alkyne would become longer. Reaction would be: cyclohexyl-C≡CH → cyclohexyl-C≡C-MgBr? No, wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, in the presence of a strong base, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl in an SN2 reaction. So, the alkyne would become -C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, NaNH2 will deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide. So, the alkyne would become -C≡C-CH3. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexylacetylene, but longer, maybe 3-pentyne or something. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would lead to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or would it add to the other end?

Wait, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal H gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride would react here, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no, because CH3Cl would provide CH3^+? No, SN2 would attack. Wait, the acetylide is a strong base. It would abstract a proton from a suitable source, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, the acetylide (strong base) would react with CH3Cl in an SN2 reaction, adding a methyl group to the sp-hybridized carbon. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to convert the triple bond into a trans double bond via dehydrohalogenation or via some elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each reagent step by step.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring connected via a CH(OH) group to another cyclohexane. Also, there's an aldehyde group on the main ring.

So, perhaps we're going to form a new cyclohexane ring via some cyclopropane opening or via some ring expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being converted into a double bond, then subjected to cyclopropanation or some addition.

Wait, maybe the sequence involves forming a ketone or aldehyde through some oxidation steps.

Looking at the options, steps involving O3 (ozone) are likely for cleavage of double bonds. So, if after forming a double bond, ozonolysis would break it, forming carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. Let's plan out the steps needed to reach the target.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe convert the triple bond into a double bond. But how? One way is to hydrogenate it. Using H2 with a catalyst like Pd would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a cis double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-C≡CH→ cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 after hydrogenation. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond (ethynyl) with H2 and Pd would give cis double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH. Hydrogenation adds H across triple bond to make double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 after full hydrogenation? No, because hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond would require more H2. Wait, maybe they're using a poisoned catalyst that stops at the alkene. Oh, right, Lindlar catalyst (Pd with quinoline) gives cis addition, but regular Pd might go all the way. Alternatively, using H2 and a catalyst would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, but I'm not sure if the options include such a step.

Wait, looking at the options, option A's step 2 is H2/Pd. So that would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is a Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones to esters, etc.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe the target is formed via a larger synthesis. Let me think about the possible steps.

Another approach is to form a benzannulation or similar, but perhaps that's too advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis of a triple bond would give something, but I'm not certain about the products. Wait, no, ozonolysis is for double bonds, not triple bonds. So maybe we need to first convert the triple bond into a double bond.

Wait, maybe the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylate it. Then, possibly hydrogenate to form a longer chain.

Wait, let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide via NaNH2 and methyl chloride → longer alkyne?
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene or an alkane?
3. Then, perhaps ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.
4. Further steps for ring formation or oxidation.

Wait, the target has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH(OH) group. Hmm, perhaps the starting material's ethynyl is part of a larger structure that will form a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to perform a Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling or similar to form a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation. So, ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 to form the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride could add a methyl group, making the alkyne longer. Maybe this forms a propargyl group.

But then, what's next? Maybe hydrogenation to form an alkene. For example, if we have a longer alkyne, hydrogenating it with H2 and Pd would give an alkene.

Wait, looking at option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond? Or to an alkene?

Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd can go either way. If using a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar), you get cis alkene. With regular Pd, perhaps it goes all the way to the alkane. Wait, but Pd is more of a catalyst for hydrogenation of alkenes, but alkynes can be hydrogenated with Lindlar to cis alkenes or with Na/NH3 to trans alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the exact conditions determine the product.

Wait, in any case, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans or cis alkene.

Then, perhaps an ozonolysis step to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group. So, ozonolysis of a double bond would give carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene was internal, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But in this case, perhaps the double bond is at a position that, when cleaved, would give the desired aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some hydration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a cyclopropane ring through some addition. I remember that alkyne cyclopropanation is possible via Simmons-Smith reaction, but that uses a diiodomethane and Zn-Cu couple. But none of the options seem to have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely with these reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a good nucleophile.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So, deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile. So, perhaps the acetylide would attack the methanol, but that would give an ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, giving a methyl group attached to the alkyne.

Wait, for example, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH → NaNH2 → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- → + CH3Cl → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But that's in option A and C.

Alternatively, if step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, the acetylide would react with methanol, perhaps giving a methoxy group? But I'm not sure about that.

Option B starts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Then Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for Birch reduction or deprotonation.

Hmm, perhaps the first step in option B is alkylation of the acetylide. So, adding ethyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Then, Li in NH3, maybe for elimination or ring formation.

But I'm not making much progress. Let's think about each step in the options.

The target molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the starting material's ethynyl group is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, perhaps the process involves forming a new ring. For example, converting the ethynyl group into a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group. So, the aldehyde could come from oxidation of an alcohol, perhaps via a Tollen's reagent or Jones reagent.

So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing an aldehyde group via oxidation.

Looking at option C, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used for elimination, like the Cope elimination or for forming epoxides. Alternatively, in some cases, it's used for saponification, but that's more with esters.

Wait, perhaps the reagent sequence in option C is as follows:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: acetylide formation and alkylation, making the alkyne longer.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation of the alkyne to alkane? Or to alkene.

If it's hydrogenated to an alkene, then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if the alkene is in the middle, it would form two carbonyls.

Then, Ba(OH)2 would perhaps saponify an ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups, which then are further modified.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the presence of a Grignard reagent or organometallic steps.

Looking at the options, some have Li in liquid NH3, which is used for deprotonation, maybe for forming Grignard-like reagents or for ring-opening.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has an aldehyde and an alcohol group attached to a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexane ring. So, maybe the steps involve forming a ketone or an aldehyde via oxidation, and an alcohol via some addition or reduction.

Wait, perhaps the reagents involve first forming a ketone, then reducing it to form an alcohol, but that doesn't fit directly with the target.

Alternatively, the aldehyde group could come from an oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Wait, let's think about the steps in option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, acetylide forms and methylates to make a longer alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond.

Wait, but that would make a longer chain. Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would act on double bonds, but if the molecule is now a single bond, maybe not. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a trans or cis alkene. But if step 2 is H2/Pd, would that hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond or stop at the alkene? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the Pd here is Lindlar, which stops at the alkene, but maybe the options don't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the step 2 is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But I don't see any halogen in the starting material.

Wait, maybe the correct option is B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

2. Li in liq NH3 → perhaps forming a Grignard, or deprotonating to form a strong base.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which would break a double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure if this leads to the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenated to form an alkene (cis or trans).

3. Ozonolysis breaks the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

4. Then, perhaps some ring-forming steps or hydroboration to form an alcohol.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on the same CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane.

So, perhaps after ozonolysis, we have two carbonyl groups, and further steps form the rings.

Alternatively, another approach: The target's structure suggests that a cyclohexane ring is attached via a CH(OH)- group to another cyclohexane. So, maybe the synthesis involves forming an epoxide, then opening it in such a way to form the rings.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a diol from an alkyne via some hydration, then forming a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some cycloaddition.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct reagents that would form the aldehyde group and the hydroxyl group.

Looking at option C, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination. For example, if there's a neighboring group, eliminating to form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH. That's a mild acid, perhaps for workup after a Grignard reaction or after ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group. So, first, maybe converting the alkyne into an enol ether, then into a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The target has a structure where a cyclohexane is connected via a CH(OH) group to another cyclohexane and an aldehyde group. So, perhaps after some steps, an aldehyde is formed, and a diol is present.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide, then alkylate to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Then, perhaps perform a oxidation or reduction step to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: acetylide forms, then reacts with methanol. So, perhaps the alkyne becomes a methyl ether? Or maybe the acetylide attacks the methanol, giving a methyl group on the alkyne.

Wait, methanol might not be a good electrophile for acetylide alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, giving a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating something or for elimination.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, which would break ozonides into aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild acid, perhaps to protonate something or for hydrolysis.

But I'm not getting the exact sequence.

Another approach: let's think about the oxidation steps. The target has an aldehyde, which is an oxidized form of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation reaction.

Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is Jones reagent. That would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in some cases, with appropriate protection, to aldehydes.

Wait, but Jones reagent is a strong oxidizing agent. It would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, not aldehydes. Unless the alcohol is protected as a methyl ether, which upon oxidation would give a ketone, but that's not helpful.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 in option C's step 3 is used for elimination, forming a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about each option and see which sequence logically leads to the desired product.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes longer (alkylation).

2. H2/Pd → Hydrogenate the alkyne to cis alkene or to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination or saponification.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation.

But I'm not sure how this would form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → Alkyne becomes longer (adding an ethyl group).

2. Li in liq NH3 → Strong base, maybe for deprotonation. Could this lead to ring formation?

3. O3, H2O → Ozonolysis of a double bond, forming carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → Workup, perhaps to form amines from imines, but not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes longer.

2. H2/Pd → Hydrogenate to alkene.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis with reductive workup, giving aldehydes or ketones.

4. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination or forming epoxide.

Hmm, not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → Acetylide reacts with methanol, perhaps giving a methyl group.

2. Li in liq NH3 → Strong base, maybe for elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis and reductive workup.

4. NH4OH → Acid workup.

Wait, maybe in option C, after step 3, ozonolysis gives two carbonyl groups, which are then treated with Ba(OH)2 to form rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate it to form a diol, then perform ozonolysis, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: the target has a cyclohexane ring attached via a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the starting material's ethynyl group is converted into a cyclohexyl group via some ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane ring, but I don't see reagents for that in the options. Alternatively, maybe through a Simmons-Smith type addition, but again, none of the options seem to have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then a Grignard reagent adds to form a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, if the alkyne is converted into a ketone, perhaps via hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (like in the oxymercuration reaction), but that would require a mercuric sulfate catalyst. But looking at the options, some have H2SO4 and HgSO4.

Wait, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the condition for oxymercuration, which converts alkynes into ketones. But wait, oxymercuration typically targets alkenes, not alkynes. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene first, then treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4, it would hydrate the alkene into a diol. Hmm, but that's for alkenes.

Wait, no, if the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4, maybe it would form a diol. But that's not the case because HgSO4 and H2SO4 are for oxymercuration of alkenes.

Alternatively, if the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a longer alkane, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider each reagent's function and see how they contribute to the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group to another cyclohexane, which has an aldehyde. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new cyclohexane ring adjacent to a CH(OH) group.

One possible way to form rings is through a cyclopropanation or by using a Wittig reaction, but I don't see those reagents here.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves a coupling reaction, but again, I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, another approach: The target has a structure where a cyclohexane is attached via a CH(OH) group. This suggests a vicinal diol, which could come from an alkene via dihydroxylation, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Robinson annulation to form a cyclohexane ring. Robinson annulation typically forms six-membered rings using a conjugated enone and a ketone.

Alternatively, the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then reacted with an organometallic reagent to form a new ring.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about each step in the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: Alkyne gets methylated, becoming longer.

Step 2: Hydrogenation to alkene.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves the alkene into carbonyls.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → possibly elimination.

But how would that form the cyclohexane rings?

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis step breaks the molecule into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne after alkylation is CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-cyclohexane. No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is in a position that, when cleaved, forms the necessary carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes longer via ethyl chloride.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonation for elimination, forming a double bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. Maybe this is formed via a Grignard reaction, where a cyclohexyl Grignard adds to a carbonyl group, followed by hydrolysis to form the alcohol.

So, perhaps one step involves forming a Grignard reagent, which adds to a ketone or aldehyde, forming the cyclohexyl-CH(OH)- structure.

Looking for Grignard-like steps, option B and D have Li in liquid NH3, which is used for such reactions.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: Let's think about each reagent's purpose.

NaNH2 is used to deprotonate the alkyne, forming an acetylide.

Methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, making a longer alkyne.

Hydrogenation (H2/Pd) would reduce the alkyne to an alkane or alkene.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or forming epoxides.

H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.

Wait, maybe in option C, after alkylating and hydrogenating, ozonolysis creates carbonyl groups, and then Ba(OH)2 forms an epoxide, which is then opened to form the cyclohexane rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne → alkyne after alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups.

4. Ba(OH)2 for elimination to form rings.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

After a lot of thinking, I'll have to make an educated guess. I think the correct option is C because the steps involve alkylating the alkyne, hydrogenating it to an alkene, ozonolysis to form aldehydes, and Ba(OH)2 for some elimination or ring formation.

But I'm not 100% confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves understanding the sequence of reagents and their roles in transforming the starting material into the target molecule. The target molecule consists of two cyclohexane rings, one with an aldehyde group and the other connected via a CH(OH) group. The synthesis likely involves functional group transformations, such as alkyne modifications, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and base-mediated reactions.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to extend the alkyne chain.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, potentially forming a longer alkane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or saponification.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. However, this does not align well with forming the aldehyde group in the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then ethylated to extend the alkyne chain.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but it is unclear how this sequence leads to the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to extend the alkyne chain.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkene.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups, with a reductive workup to form aldehydes or ketones.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or ring formation, which could help in forming the cyclohexane rings.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol. However, methanol is a poor electrophile, making this step unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides a logical sequence of steps. The alkyne is first extended via alkylation, then hydrogenated to an alkene. Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)₂ could facilitate elimination or ring formation to yield the target molecule. This sequence aligns best with the transformations needed to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I should probably think about the target molecule. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, that means there are two cyclohexane rings. One has a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) attached, and the other is connected via a CH(OH) group. Wait, actually, the structure is cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl connected via a CH2 group, which has an OH and a methyl group? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me draw this out mentally.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane. Then, the substituent at position 1 (which would be adjacent to the aldehyde group?) is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl ring and has an OH group on it. So, the structure is like a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde, and at position 1, a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected via a methylene group (CH2) that has an OH. So, it's something like cyclohexyl-CH(OH)- attached to the main cyclohexane ring, which also has a CHO group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, it's CH2-C≡CH connected to a cyclohexane ring.

I think the synthesis will involve several steps, perhaps including functional group transformations and some cyclopropane or cyclohexane forming reactions.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reagents. Let me think about what each reagent does.

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride could be an alkylating agent. So maybe a nucleophilic substitution? Like forming a new carbon chain.

Option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in liquid NH3; then O3 and H2O; then NH4OH.

Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, like in Birch reductions or for forming Grignard-like reagents. Ozone followed by workup (like with H2O and then NH4OH) is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

H2/Pd-CaCO3 is hydrogenation, maybe reducing triple bonds to single bonds or alkenes. Ozone with (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which would break ozonides into aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li in liquid NH3; O3 with (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Methanol as an alkylation agent? Maybe forming an ether or something else. Li and NH3 could be for deprotonation or ring-opening.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Triple bond. So, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate it to form an alkyne with a good leaving group. Or maybe form a longer chain.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. If you have ethynylcyclohexane and treat it with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, that's an alkylation. But wait, NaNH2 is a base, so maybe deprotonating the alkyne? Or maybe it's a Grignard-type addition.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (since it's -C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). Deprotonating with a strong base like NaNH2 would give the cyclohexyl acetylide ion. Then, methyl chloride could alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So, the alkyne would become longer. Reaction would be: cyclohexyl-C≡CH → cyclohexyl-C≡C-MgBr? No, wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, in the presence of a strong base, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl in an SN2 reaction. So, the alkyne would become -C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, NaNH2 will deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide. So, the alkyne would become -C≡C-CH3. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexylacetylene, but longer, maybe 3-pentyne or something. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would lead to cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? Or would it add to the other end?

Wait, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal H gives cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride would react here, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no, because CH3Cl would provide CH3^+? No, SN2 would attack. Wait, the acetylide is a strong base. It would abstract a proton from a suitable source, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, the acetylide (strong base) would react with CH3Cl in an SN2 reaction, adding a methyl group to the sp-hybridized carbon. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to convert the triple bond into a trans double bond via dehydrohalogenation or via some elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each reagent step by step.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring connected via a CH(OH) group to another cyclohexane. Also, there's an aldehyde group on the main ring.

So, perhaps we're going to form a new cyclohexane ring via some cyclopropane opening or via some ring expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is being converted into a double bond, then subjected to cyclopropanation or some addition.

Wait, maybe the sequence involves forming a ketone or aldehyde through some oxidation steps.

Looking at the options, steps involving O3 (ozone) are likely for cleavage of double bonds. So, if after forming a double bond, ozonolysis would break it, forming carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. Let's plan out the steps needed to reach the target.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe convert the triple bond into a double bond. But how? One way is to hydrogenate it. Using H2 with a catalyst like Pd would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a cis double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-C≡CH→ cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 after hydrogenation. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond (ethynyl) with H2 and Pd would give cis double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH. Hydrogenation adds H across triple bond to make double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 after full hydrogenation? No, because hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond would require more H2. Wait, maybe they're using a poisoned catalyst that stops at the alkene. Oh, right, Lindlar catalyst (Pd with quinoline) gives cis addition, but regular Pd might go all the way. Alternatively, using H2 and a catalyst would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, but I'm not sure if the options include such a step.

Wait, looking at the options, option A's step 2 is H2/Pd. So that would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is a Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones to esters, etc.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe the target is formed via a larger synthesis. Let me think about the possible steps.

Another approach is to form a benzannulation or similar, but perhaps that's too advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis of a triple bond would give something, but I'm not certain about the products. Wait, no, ozonolysis is for double bonds, not triple bonds. So maybe we need to first convert the triple bond into a double bond.

Wait, maybe the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylate it. Then, possibly hydrogenate to form a longer chain.

Wait, let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide via NaNH2 and methyl chloride → longer alkyne?
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene or an alkane?
3. Then, perhaps ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.
4. Further steps for ring formation or oxidation.

Wait, the target has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH(OH) group. Hmm, perhaps the starting material's ethynyl is part of a larger structure that will form a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to perform a Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling or similar to form a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation. So, ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 to form the acetylide. Then, methyl chloride could add a methyl group, making the alkyne longer. Maybe this forms a propargyl group.

But then, what's next? Maybe hydrogenation to form an alkene. For example, if we have a longer alkyne, hydrogenating it with H2 and Pd would give an alkene.

Wait, looking at option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond? Or to an alkene?

Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd can go either way. If using a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar), you get cis alkene. With regular Pd, perhaps it goes all the way to the alkane. Wait, but Pd is more of a catalyst for hydrogenation of alkenes, but alkynes can be hydrogenated with Lindlar to cis alkenes or with Na/NH3 to trans alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the exact conditions determine the product.

Wait, in any case, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans or cis alkene.

Then, perhaps an ozonolysis step to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group. So, ozonolysis of a double bond would give carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene was internal, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But in this case, perhaps the double bond is at a position that, when cleaved, would give the desired aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via some hydration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a cyclopropane ring through some addition. I remember that alkyne cyclopropanation is possible via Simmons-Smith reaction, but that uses a diiodomethane and Zn-Cu couple. But none of the options seem to have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely with these reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a good nucleophile.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So, deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile. So, perhaps the acetylide would attack the methanol, but that would give an ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, giving a methyl group attached to the alkyne.

Wait, for example, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH → NaNH2 → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- → + CH3Cl → cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. But that's in option A and C.

Alternatively, if step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, the acetylide would react with methanol, perhaps giving a methoxy group? But I'm not sure about that.

Option B starts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Then Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for Birch reduction or deprotonation.

Hmm, perhaps the first step in option B is alkylation of the acetylide. So, adding ethyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Then, Li in NH3, maybe for elimination or ring formation.

But I'm not making much progress. Let's think about each step in the options.

The target molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the starting material's ethynyl group is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, perhaps the process involves forming a new ring. For example, converting the ethynyl group into a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group. So, the aldehyde could come from oxidation of an alcohol, perhaps via a Tollen's reagent or Jones reagent.

So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing an aldehyde group via oxidation.

Looking at option C, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used for elimination, like the Cope elimination or for forming epoxides. Alternatively, in some cases, it's used for saponification, but that's more with esters.

Wait, perhaps the reagent sequence in option C is as follows:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: acetylide formation and alkylation, making the alkyne longer.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation of the alkyne to alkane? Or to alkene.

If it's hydrogenated to an alkene, then step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if the alkene is in the middle, it would form two carbonyls.

Then, Ba(OH)2 would perhaps saponify an ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups, which then are further modified.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the presence of a Grignard reagent or organometallic steps.

Looking at the options, some have Li in liquid NH3, which is used for deprotonation, maybe for forming Grignard-like reagents or for ring-opening.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has an aldehyde and an alcohol group attached to a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexane ring. So, maybe the steps involve forming a ketone or an aldehyde via oxidation, and an alcohol via some addition or reduction.

Wait, perhaps the reagents involve first forming a ketone, then reducing it to form an alcohol, but that doesn't fit directly with the target.

Alternatively, the aldehyde group could come from an oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Wait, let's think about the steps in option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, acetylide forms and methylates to make a longer alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenating the alkyne to an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond.

Wait, but that would make a longer chain. Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would act on double bonds, but if the molecule is now a single bond, maybe not. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a trans or cis alkene. But if step 2 is H2/Pd, would that hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond or stop at the alkene? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the Pd here is Lindlar, which stops at the alkene, but maybe the options don't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the step 2 is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But I don't see any halogen in the starting material.

Wait, maybe the correct option is B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkyne becomes longer.

2. Li in liq NH3 → perhaps forming a Grignard, or deprotonating to form a strong base.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which would break a double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure if this leads to the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated to form a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenated to form an alkene (cis or trans).

3. Ozonolysis breaks the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

4. Then, perhaps some ring-forming steps or hydroboration to form an alcohol.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on the same CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane.

So, perhaps after ozonolysis, we have two carbonyl groups, and further steps form the rings.

Alternatively, another approach: The target's structure suggests that a cyclohexane ring is attached via a CH(OH)- group to another cyclohexane. So, maybe the synthesis involves forming an epoxide, then opening it in such a way to form the rings.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve forming a diol from an alkyne via some hydration, then forming a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to some cycloaddition.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct reagents that would form the aldehyde group and the hydroxyl group.

Looking at option C, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination. For example, if there's a neighboring group, eliminating to form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH. That's a mild acid, perhaps for workup after a Grignard reaction or after ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group. So, first, maybe converting the alkyne into an enol ether, then into a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The target has a structure where a cyclohexane is connected via a CH(OH) group to another cyclohexane and an aldehyde group. So, perhaps after some steps, an aldehyde is formed, and a diol is present.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate to acetylide, then alkylate to add a methyl group, making a longer alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Then, perhaps perform a oxidation or reduction step to form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: acetylide forms, then reacts with methanol. So, perhaps the alkyne becomes a methyl ether? Or maybe the acetylide attacks the methanol, giving a methyl group on the alkyne.

Wait, methanol might not be a good electrophile for acetylide alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, giving a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating something or for elimination.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, which would break ozonides into aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild acid, perhaps to protonate something or for hydrolysis.

But I'm not getting the exact sequence.

Another approach: let's think about the oxidation steps. The target has an aldehyde, which is an oxidized form of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation reaction.

Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is Jones reagent. That would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in some cases, with appropriate protection, to aldehydes.

Wait, but Jones reagent is a strong oxidizing agent. It would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, not aldehydes. Unless the alcohol is protected as a methyl ether, which upon oxidation would give a ketone, but that's not helpful.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 in option C's step 3 is used for elimination, forming a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about each option and see which sequence logically leads to the desired product.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes longer (alkylation).

2. H2/Pd → Hydrogenate the alkyne to cis alkene or to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination or saponification.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation.

But I'm not sure how this would form the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → Alkyne becomes longer (adding an ethyl group).

2. Li in liq NH3 → Strong base, maybe for deprotonation. Could this lead to ring formation?

3. O3, H2O → Ozonolysis of a double bond, forming carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → Workup, perhaps to form amines from imines, but not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → Alkyne becomes longer.

2. H2/Pd → Hydrogenate to alkene.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis with reductive workup, giving aldehydes or ketones.

4. Ba(OH)2 → Maybe elimination or forming epoxide.

Hmm, not sure.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → Acetylide reacts with methanol, perhaps giving a methyl group.

2. Li in liq NH3 → Strong base, maybe for elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis and reductive workup.

4. NH4OH → Acid workup.

Wait, maybe in option C, after step 3, ozonolysis gives two carbonyl groups, which are then treated with Ba(OH)2 to form rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate it to form a diol, then perform ozonolysis, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: the target has a cyclohexane ring attached via a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the starting material's ethynyl group is converted into a cyclohexyl group via some ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane ring, but I don't see reagents for that in the options. Alternatively, maybe through a Simmons-Smith type addition, but again, none of the options seem to have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then a Grignard reagent adds to form a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, if the alkyne is converted into a ketone, perhaps via hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (like in the oxymercuration reaction), but that would require a mercuric sulfate catalyst. But looking at the options, some have H2SO4 and HgSO4.

Wait, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the condition for oxymercuration, which converts alkynes into ketones. But wait, oxymercuration typically targets alkenes, not alkynes. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene first, then treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4, it would hydrate the alkene into a diol. Hmm, but that's for alkenes.

Wait, no, if the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4, maybe it would form a diol. But that's not the case because HgSO4 and H2SO4 are for oxymercuration of alkenes.

Alternatively, if the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a longer alkane, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider each reagent's function and see how they contribute to the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group to another cyclohexane, which has an aldehyde. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new cyclohexane ring adjacent to a CH(OH) group.

One possible way to form rings is through a cyclopropanation or by using a Wittig reaction, but I don't see those reagents here.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves a coupling reaction, but again, I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, another approach: The target has a structure where a cyclohexane is attached via a CH(OH) group. This suggests a vicinal diol, which could come from an alkene via dihydroxylation, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Robinson annulation to form a cyclohexane ring. Robinson annulation typically forms six-membered rings using a conjugated enone and a ketone.

Alternatively, the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then reacted with an organometallic reagent to form a new ring.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about each step in the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: Alkyne gets methylated, becoming longer.

Step 2: Hydrogenation to alkene.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves the alkene into carbonyls.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → possibly elimination.

But how would that form the cyclohexane rings?

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis step breaks the molecule into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne after alkylation is CH2-C≡C-CH2-CH2-cyclohexane. No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is in a position that, when cleaved, forms the necessary carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes longer via ethyl chloride.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonation for elimination, forming a double bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. Maybe this is formed via a Grignard reaction, where a cyclohexyl Grignard adds to a carbonyl group, followed by hydrolysis to form the alcohol.

So, perhaps one step involves forming a Grignard reagent, which adds to a ketone or aldehyde, forming the cyclohexyl-CH(OH)- structure.

Looking for Grignard-like steps, option B and D have Li in liquid NH3, which is used for such reactions.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: Let's think about each reagent's purpose.

NaNH2 is used to deprotonate the alkyne, forming an acetylide.

Methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, making a longer alkyne.

Hydrogenation (H2/Pd) would reduce the alkyne to an alkane or alkene.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or forming epoxides.

H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.

Wait, maybe in option C, after alkylating and hydrogenating, ozonolysis creates carbonyl groups, and then Ba(OH)2 forms an epoxide, which is then opened to form the cyclohexane rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne → alkyne after alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis forms two carbonyl groups.

4. Ba(OH)2 for elimination to form rings.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

After a lot of thinking, I'll have to make an educated guess. I think the correct option is C because the steps involve alkylating the alkyne, hydrogenating it to an alkene, ozonolysis to form aldehydes, and Ba(OH)2 for some elimination or ring formation.

But I'm not 100% confident.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the analysis of the options involves understanding the sequence of reagents and their roles in transforming the starting material into the target molecule. The target molecule consists of two cyclohexane rings, one with an aldehyde group and the other connected via a CH(OH) group. The synthesis likely involves functional group transformations, such as alkyne modifications, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and base-mediated reactions.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to extend the alkyne chain.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, potentially forming a longer alkane.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or saponification.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. However, this does not align well with forming the aldehyde group in the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then ethylated to extend the alkyne chain.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but it is unclear how this sequence leads to the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to extend the alkyne chain.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to an alkene.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups, with a reductive workup to form aldehydes or ketones.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or ring formation, which could help in forming the cyclohexane rings.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol. However, methanol is a poor electrophile, making this step unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or elimination.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides a logical sequence of steps. The alkyne is first extended via alkylation, then hydrogenated to an alkene. Ozonolysis cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)₂ could facilitate elimination or ring formation to yield the target molecule. This sequence aligns best with the transformations needed to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
