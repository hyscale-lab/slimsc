Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the steps, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume.

First, I need to break this down. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, right? So when it dissolves in an acid, it should react. The acid is monobasic and strong. Monobasic means it can donate one proton, so it's like HCl, HNO3, etc. Strong acid means it dissociates completely.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid (let's say HCl) would be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl.

First step: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Fe(OH)3's molar mass: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1 = 3
Total: 55.85 +48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol

Molar mass is approximately 106.85 g/mol.

Mass given is 0.1 g. So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately.

0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.0009359 moles. Let's say approximately 9.36 ×10^-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 × 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

But wait, the HCl is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. We need to find the volume of HCl solution that provides 0.002808 moles.

Volume (in liters) = moles / Molarity = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, that's about 28.08 cm³.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is really close. But wait, what about the total volume of the solution? The problem states that the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. Oh wait, no. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So, the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid solution added (V) plus the initial volume (maybe) equals 100 cm³? Wait, wait, maybe the initial solution is 100 cm³, and we add V cm³ of acid, so the total becomes (100 + V) cm³. But the question says "total volume is 100 cm³". Hmm, so perhaps the solution is made by adding V cm³ of acid to the Fe(OH)3, and the total volume is 100 cm³. So V would be 100 cm³ minus the volume of Fe(OH)3 solution. But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a solid, right? So it's just dissolved in the acid, so the initial volume might just be the volume of the acid plus the solid. So maybe the 100 cm³ is the total solution volume after adding the acid. So the volume of acid added is V, and the total solution is 100 cm³.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the final solution volume is 100 cm³, which comes from the acid solution. So the acid is diluted to the final volume of 100 cm³. So the moles of HCl needed is 0.002808 mol, and the concentration is 0.1 M. So the volume of HCl needed is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. But wait, if the total solution volume is 100 cm³, then the volume of the acid solution is 100 cm³. Because adding V cm³ of acid (which is 0.1 M) to the solid would make the total solution volume 100 cm³. So the moles from the acid would be 0.1 * V, where V is in liters. Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the approach.

Wait, perhaps I was right the first time. The problem is that we're adding V cm³ of 0.1 M HCl to the Fe(OH)3, which is a solid. So the initial solution volume is V cm³ (the acid), but when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, the total volume is 100 cm³. So V plus the volume of Fe(OH)3 solution equals 100 cm³. But Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its volume is negligible, so V ≈ 100 cm³. Hmm, but that complicates things, perhaps I'm making an incorrect assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the acid is diluted to 100 cm³, so the HCl is diluted by the entire 100 cm³. So the initial volume of HCl is V, then diluted to 100 cm³. So the number of moles of HCl is 0.1 * V (in liters), and that should be equal to 0.002808 mol.

So 0.1 * V = 0.002808 → V = 0.002808 / 0.1 → V=0.02808 liters =28.08 cm³. So the volume of acid needed is about 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. So the minimum volume is approximately 28.08 cm³, and the closest option is C: 28.05 cm³.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the acid solution is such that when you add it to the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid solution is V, which makes the total solution volume 100 cm³. So the moles of HCl is 0.1 * (V / 1000) [since V is in cm³, so liters is V/1000]. That's 0.1 * V/1000 = 0.00001 V. Moles needed: 0.002808.

So 0.00001 V = 0.002808 → V = 0.002808 / 0.00001 = 280.8 cm³. Wait, that can't be right because that's more than the 100 cm³. So I must have messed up the approach.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if I have 100 cm³ as the final volume, and the acid is added to that, the initial volume of the acid must be less than 100 cm³. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the final concentration.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing mixing solutions. Let me think again.

When you add V cm³ of 0.1 M HCl to a solution (or solid), the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So the moles of HCl added are 0.1 * (V / 1000) (since V is in cm³, converted to liters by dividing by 1000). These moles should be equal to 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol = 0.0009359 mol.

HCl needed: 3 * 0.0009359 = 0.0028077 mol.

So 0.1 * (V / 1000) = 0.0028077 → V = (0.0028077 * 1000) / 0.1 → 28.077 cm³.

So approximately 28.08 cm³. So the volume of HCl needed is 28.08 cm³, which is option C's 28.05 cm³.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution.

After dissolving, the solution contains Fe^3+ ions and Cl- ions. Since HCl is a strong acid, it's fully dissociated. But once all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the solution will have excess H+ ions from the acid, as well as the Fe^3+ ions. However, Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution more acidic.

Wait, but which is the dominant factor here? The initial strong acid or the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The initial amount of HCl is 0.002808 mol in 0.1 L (100 cm³ is 0.1 L). So the concentration of HCl is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 M. But wait, no. Wait, the HCl is added to 100 cm³. So the concentration of H+ from HCl is 0.02808 M. However, Fe^3+ can hydrolyze as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

But since we've added excess H+ (from HCl), the hydrolysis might be suppressed because of the common ion effect. So the solution's pH is primarily determined by the excess H+ from HCl, but we also need to consider any contribution from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The initial H+ from HCl is 0.02808 M, which is about 0.028 M. Let's compute pH: pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55. But wait, that's just from HCl. But wait, wait a minute. The moles of HCl added are equal to 3 times moles of Fe(OH)3. So all the Fe(OH)3 should react with the HCl, producing Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

Wait, no, because Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- ions. Each mole reacts with 3 H+ from HCl.

So after reaction:

Moles of Fe^3+: 0.0009359 mol.

Moles of Cl^-: 0.0028077 mol.

But after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution contains Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. But the H+ comes from HCl that was in excess, except in this case, the moles of HCl are exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So all the HCl would be consumed, right? Because each Fe(OH)3 needs 3 H+.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it reacts with H+.

Reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.0028077 mol.

Moles of H+ added: 0.1 M × V (in liters) → V is 28.08 cm³ → 0.02808 L × 0.1 = 0.002808 mol. So exact stoichiometric amount. So all HCl is consumed, and all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, producing Fe^3+ and H2O.

Wait, but that would mean that the H+ in solution comes from the dissociation of Fe^3+.

So the solution after reaction will have Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions, and H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But wait, let me double-check.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ to produce Fe^3+ and water. If the moles of H+ are exactly 3 times Fe(OH)3, then all H+ and Fe(OH)3 are consumed, so the solution will have Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

So the [Fe^3+] = moles / volume (L) → 0.0009359 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009359 M.

Fe^3+ can hydrolyze in water:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The hydrolysis produces H+ ions, contributing to the acidity of the solution.

So the concentration of H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis can be calculated using the hydrolysis constant.

But I don't remember the exact K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, I can think about the pH.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is a reaction that produces H+ ions. Let's denote the concentration of Fe^3+ as c = 0.009359 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K off the top of my head. Alternatively, I can look for the hydrolysis constant or the K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Wait, perhaps I can find the pH based on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the H+ from water autoionization, but I think that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: since the solution is acidic, the pH will be less than 7. Let me think about the possible pH values in the options. The options given are A: 3.16; B: 2.69; C: 2.04; D:4.94.

Wait, if the Fe^3+ is 0.009359 M, and assuming that the hydrolysis is significant, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ after reaction. Wait, no, because in this case, the H+ from HCl is exactly consumed by Fe(OH)3. So the H+ in solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But wait, another thought: perhaps after adding the HCl, some H+ remains. Or maybe not. Because if the moles of H+ exactly match the reaction, then all H+ is consumed, and the solution's H+ comes from water and hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the stoichiometry.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.0009359 mol.

Moles of HCl added: 3 × 0.0009359 = 0.0028077 mol.

So the HCl added is exactly 3 times the Fe(OH)3. So all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and all HCl is consumed. So the solution will contain Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

Cl^- is the spectator ion. Fe^3+ will hydrolyze in water.

So the [Fe^3+] is 0.0009359 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009359 M.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression for K is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But without knowing K, perhaps I can find the pH another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ is known. I think that for Fe^3+, the hydrolysis constant is around 1e-33? No, wait, that's for something else. Or wait, maybe I should think about the hydrolysis in terms of the formation of Fe(OH)3.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be calculated using the concentration of Fe^3+ and assuming some degree of hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the solution will have a low pH because Fe^3+ is a strong enough acid to hydrolyze significantly.

Wait, but if I can't remember the exact K, maybe I can estimate the pH based on the concentration.

Wait, another approach: after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ at 0.009359 M. Let's assume that the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ produces x amount of H+.

The reaction: Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Wait, no, the correct stoichiometry is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me denote the hydrolysis as producing 3 H+ per Fe^3+.

So the equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But without K, perhaps I can find the pH using an approximation.

Assume that the hydrolysis is significant, and that [H+] is much greater than 1e-7 (i.e., solution is acidic).

Let me make an assumption that x is the concentration of H+ produced per Fe^3+.

But this is getting complicated, perhaps I should think of the solution's pH based on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

I think that the pH of a 0.01 M Fe^3+ solution is around 2. So perhaps the pH here is about 2, which would match option C: pH 2.04.

But wait, let me think again. The concentration is 0.009359 M, which is about 0.00936 M. Let's say it's approximately 0.01 M.

If I consider that Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to produce H+:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

The expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But without knowing K, perhaps I can look for another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+.

Wait, I think the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ is about 1e-38. Wait, that seems very small. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the K value. Oh wait, I think the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ is approximately 6 × 10^-38. But I'm not certain.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a weak acid.

If Fe^3+ behaves as a weak acid, its hydrolysis can be treated as such. So the concentration of H+ can be approximated using the formula for a weak acid:

[H+] = sqrt( (K * c) )

Wait, but that's for a monoprotic acid. Here, each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ ions. So perhaps it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution can be considered as a solution of Fe^3+ hydrolyzing to produce H+.

But this is getting too complicated, and I'm not sure of the exact steps. Maybe I should think about the possible pH values given in the options and see which makes sense.

Given that the concentration is about 0.00936 M Fe^3+, and it's a strong enough acid to produce a pH around 2. So option C has pH 2.04, which seems about right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it. Let's proceed.

Assume that the hydrolysis reaction contributes x M of H+.

The initial [Fe^3+] is 0.009359 M. The change due to hydrolysis is -x, and [H+] increases by 3x.

Wait, but each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+, so the change in [H+] is +3x. So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[Fe^3+] = 0.009359 - x ≈ 0.009359 (since x is small compared to 0.009359)

[Fe(OH)3] = x

[H+] = 3x + 1e-7 (from water), but 3x is much larger than 1e-7, so we can ignore the 1e-7.

So the K expression becomes:

K = (x) * (3x)^3 / (0.009359)

K = x * 27 x^3 / 0.009359 = 27 x^4 / 0.009359.

But I don't know K. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find K for the reaction Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is equal to Kw / K_b, where K_b is the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, I think K_b for Fe(OH)3 is about 6 × 10^-38. So K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) ) = approximately 1.67e23.

Wait, that's a very large K, which would mean the reaction strongly favors products. So the hydrolysis would proceed almost completely, releasing a lot of H+.

But wait, if K is 1.67e23, which is a very large number, that suggests that the reaction goes almost to completion, so x is almost 0.009359.

Wait, but that's not possible because [H+] can't be more than 1 M or so. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct K value for Fe(OH)3 hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing K values.

Wait, another approach: The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a stepwise process. The first H+ comes from Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The K1 for this step is about 5.6e-3 (though I'm not sure of the exact value).

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the pH of a 0.01 M Fe^3+ solution. From my vague memory, I think such a solution has a pH around 2. So perhaps in this problem, the pH is around 2.04, which matches option C.

But another way: Let's say that the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ produces H+ such that [H+] = sqrt( (3 * K * c) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for polyprotic hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ and its hydrolysis constant.

But without knowing the exact K, this is getting difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but in this case, we used exactly the right amount, so all H+ is consumed. So the remaining H+ comes from water and Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the options given.

Looking at the options, option C's pH is 2.04, which is lower than the others. If the Fe^3+ hydrolysis is the main source of H+, then that would explain a pH around 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH using the assumption that [H+] is 0.009359^(3/4) or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009359 M. If the hydrolysis reaction produces H+ such that [H+] = (K * c)^(1/3), but I'm probably making this up.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be found using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid. Since Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of a weak base (Fe(OH)3), the solution will be acidic.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pC) / 2?

Wait, no, perhaps the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I can model the hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Assuming that [Fe(OH)3] = x, and [H+] = 3x.

Then:

K = (x) * (3x)^3 / (0.009359 - x) ≈ (x * 27 x^3) / 0.009359 = 27 x^4 / 0.009359.

But without K, I can't solve for x. So perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the known K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Upon some quick research (in real life, I'd look this up), I find that the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ is approximately 6 × 10^-38.

Wait, but that's a very small K, which would mean the reaction doesn't proceed much, so x would be small.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify: K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

So K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

If K is 6e-38, then the reaction doesn't proceed much, so x is very small.

So let's plug in.

K = 6e-38 = (x) * (3x)^3 / 0.009359.

So 6e-38 = (x * 27 x^3) / 0.009359 → 27 x^4 = 6e-38 * 0.009359.

Let me compute 6e-38 * 0.009359 ≈ 5.615e-40.

So 27 x^4 =5.615e-40 → x^4 = 5.615e-40 / 27 → approximately 2.08e-41.

So x = (2.08e-41)^(1/4). Let's compute this.

The fourth root of 2.08e-41: The fourth root of 1e-40 is 1e-10. 2.08 is about 2^0.5 → 1.44. So approx 1.44e-10.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

x^4 = 2.08e-41 → x = (2.08e-41)^(1/4) ≈ (2.08)^(1/4) * (1e-41)^(1/4) → approx 1.19 * 1e-10.25 → Wait, no, (1e-41)^(1/4)=1e-10.25= approx 5.62e-11.

Wait, maybe using logarithms.

log10(x^4)= log10(2.08e-41) → log(2.08) + (-41) → 0.318 + (-41) = -40.682.

log10(x) = (-40.682)/4 = -10.1705 → x=10^(-10.1705)= approx 6.67e-11.

So x≈6.67e-11 M.

Then [H+] =3x=2.0e-10 M.

pH= -log(2e-10) ≈ 9.7.

Wait, that's a pH of around 9.7, which is basic. But that doesn't make sense because Fe^3+ is acidic. I must have made a mistake in the K value.

Wait, perhaps I got the K value wrong. Maybe the K is actually large, not small. Because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, its Kb is small. So K for the hydrolysis (which is acidic) would be Kw / Kb, making it large.

Ah, that's correct. Because K for the hydrolysis (acidic reaction) is K = Kw / Kb.

If Kb is small, then K is large, meaning the hydrolysis proceeds significantly.

So, let me find Kb for Fe(OH)3. From my memory, Kb for Fe(OH)3 is about 6 × 10^-38. So K= (1e-14)/(6e-38) )= approx 1.67e23.

That's a very large K, so the reaction proceeds almost to completion, so x is nearly 0.009359.

But that would make [H+] extremely high, which is not possible because the solution can't have [H+] higher than 1 M, but let's see.

Wait, if K is 1.67e23, then:

1.67e23 = (x * (3x)^3 ) / 0.009359.

So 1.67e23 * 0.009359 = 27x^4.

Compute left side: 1.67e23 * 0.009359 ≈ 1.566e21.

So 27x^4 =1.566e21 → x^4 = (1.566e21) /27 ≈5.796e19 → x= (5.796e19)^(1/4).

Compute the fourth root: 1e4^4 =1e16. So 5.796e19 is about 5.8e19. The fourth root of 5.8e19 is approximately (5.8)^(1/4) * (1e19)^(1/4).

(1e19)^(1/4) = (1e12)^(1/4) * (1e7)^(1/4) → I'm getting a bit stuck here, but let's approximate.

(5.8)^(1/4) is about 1.55.

(1e19)^(1/4)= (1e12)^(1/4) * (1e7)^(1/4) )= (1e3 * 1e1.75) ) → Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute log.

log10(5.796e19) = log10(5.796) + 19 →≈ 0.763 +19=19.763.

Divide by 4: 4.94075. So x=10^4.94075 ≈8.7e4 M. That's impossible because it's way higher than the concentration of Fe^3+.

So something's wrong here. I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this with the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.009359, but that can't be the case if K is so large.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is so acidic that the hydrolysis doesn't contribute much because the solution is already acidic enough from another source. But in this case, the H+ from HCl is exactly consumed, so the only H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis and water autoionization.

Wait, but if K is 1.67e23, which is very large, the reaction goes almost to completion, meaning that almost all Fe^3+ is converted to Fe(OH)3, releasing H+.

But that would imply that [H+] is 3x, where x ≈ 0.009359 M. So [H+] ≈ 0.028 M, which gives pH ≈ 1.55. But this isn't one of the options.

Wait, but the options don't have a pH around 1.55. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but in this case, the H+ from HCl was exactly consumed, so the excess H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But without knowing the exact K, perhaps I should proceed with the given options and the volume.

Given that the volume is about 28.08 cm³, which matches option C, and the pH is around 2.04, which is option C's pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Suppose I add more acid than needed, then the solution would have excess H+ from the acid, but in this case, the problem states that we're finding the minimum volume needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, which suggests that it's exactly the stoichiometric amount. So no excess H+ from acid, only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

If the pH is around 2, option C is the best fit.

To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, we first calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:

- Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 (Fe) + 3 × 16 (O) + 3 × 1 (H) = 106.85 g/mol.
- Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

The reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and a strong monobasic acid (e.g., HCl) is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{FeCl}_3 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Therefore, the moles of HCl required are:

\[
\text{Moles of HCl} = 3 \times 0.000936 \, \text{mol} = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The HCl solution is 0.1 M, so the volume of HCl required is:

\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.002808 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{mol/L}} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

This matches closely with the 28.05 cm³ given in option C.

Next, we determine the pH of the resulting solution. After the reaction, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]

The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:

\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3}{\text{Total volume of solution}} = \frac{0.000936 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis constant \( K \) for Fe³⁺ is approximately \( 6 \times 10^{-38} \), and the equilibrium expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Fe(OH)}_3][\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]}.
\]

Assuming \( [\text{Fe(OH)}_3] = x \) and \( [\text{H}^+] = 3x \), we solve for \( x \):

\[
K = \frac{x(3x)^3}{0.00936} = \frac{27x^4}{0.00936}.
\]

Substituting \( K = 6 \times 10^{-38} \):

\[
6 \times 10^{-38} = \frac{27x^4}{0.00936} \implies x^4 = \frac{6 \times 10^{-38} \times 0.00936}{27} \approx 2.08 \times 10^{-41}.
\]

\[
x = (2.08 \times 10^{-41})^{1/4} \approx 6.7 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Thus, \( [\text{H}^+] = 3x \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{M} \). The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+] = -\log_{10}(2.0 \times 10^{-10}) \approx 9.7.
\]

However, this result seems inconsistent with the acidic nature of Fe³⁺. Reassessing the problem, the pH is primarily determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, and the closest pH value to the expected acidic range is 2.04, as given in option C.

**Conclusion:** The minimum volume of 0.1 M HCl required is approximately 28.05 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.04.
