Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a particle depends on its mass and the masses of the particles it can decay into. The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction, which tells me how the boson X interacts with fermions.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I think this is similar to the Yukawa interaction term, where the boson X couples to fermions. The term λf would be the coupling constant for each fermion species f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the sum of the fermion masses is less than or equal to X's mass. Because in decay processes, conservation laws require that the energy of the parent particle is at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

Wait, but for each fermion species, f, the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of that fermion. Because when a particle decays into two particles, each must have mass less than or equal to half the parent's mass if they are at rest.

So I need to list all the possible fermions that have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by two is 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's list their masses:

- Up and down quarks: their masses are about 2-5 MeV, which is way less than 3 GeV. So u and d can definitely be decay products.

- Strange quark: around 100 MeV, which is also much less than 3 GeV.

- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV. Oh wait, 1.5 GeV is more than 1 GeV but less than 3, so it's allowed.

- Bottom quark: mass around 4-5 GeV. Wait, that's 4 GeV, which is more than half of X's mass (3 GeV). So bottom quarks are too heavy for X to decay into. So b and anti-b can't be produced, right?

- Top quark: way heavier, like 173 GeV, so no way.

For leptons:

- Electron: mass ~0.0005 GeV, negligible. So e+ e- is allowed.

- Muon: ~0.1 GeV, so also allowed.

- Tau lepton: ~1.78 GeV. So each tau is 1.78, so two taus would be 3.56 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV? Wait, no wait. Wait, X is 6 GeV. So each tau is about 1.78, so two taus would sum to about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait no, wait no: the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the rest frame of X, the decay products can have kinetic energy as well. So the condition is that each fermion's mass must be less than X's mass divided by 2. Because if X is at rest, the two fermions would each have at least their rest mass, and their total would be at most X's mass.

Wait, that's right. So for each fermion f, m_f must be less than or equal to M_X / 2. So for X to decay into f and f̄, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let me list the fermions:

Quarks:

u: ~2 MeV → yes.

d: ~3-5 MeV → yes.

s: ~100 MeV → yes.

c: ~1.5 GeV → yes.

b: ~4.5 GeV → no, because 4.5 > 3 GeV.

t: way too heavy, so no.

Leptons:

e: ~0.0005 GeV → yes.

mu: ~0.1 GeV → yes.

tau: 1.78 GeV → yes, because 1.78 <3.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → bb, ss, uu, dd, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait, if b is 4.5 GeV, each, so two would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b and anti-b. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → cc, ss, uu, dd, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, so it includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all the allowed fermions except b and t. So B seems possible.

Wait, but what about whether X can decay into other quarks like top? No, top is way too heavy.

Option C: X → cc, ss, uu, dd, tt, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But top quark is way too heavy, so X can't decay into top-antitop. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → bb, ss, uu, dd, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, bb is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct decay channels are the ones that include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Which is option B.

Wait, but let me look again. The Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). I think this is a Yukawa coupling term, where X couples to each fermion f. So each fermion f with a non-zero coupling can be a decay product.

But wait, do we have to consider whether the fermion is charged or neutral? Or maybe not, because the coupling is to ψf, which could be any fermion.

But in reality, the fermions would be charged or uncharged. But for decay, as long as the fermion can be produced in pairs (like quarks in pairs, but for leptons, it's +/-).

Wait, but the decay X → f f̄ would require that the fermion f is charged in a way that the sum is neutral. Wait, but the initial state is a boson X, which is a neutral boson (assuming). So the decay products must be a fermion and antifermion, which is neutral overall. So that's fine.

But looking back, the options include pairs like tau+tau-, which would have a total charge of 0. Same for mu+mu- and e+e-.

So which options include all the possible fermions where m_f <=3 GeV.

So the correct decay channels are into c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options, option B includes all these except for the bottom quark, which is excluded.

Wait, option B says X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermions. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \). For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of the fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy:

\[
m_f \leq \frac{M_X}{2} = \frac{6 \, \text{GeV}}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- \( u, d \): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed, \( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- \( s \): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, \( > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, \( \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

Thus, the allowed decay channels are \( X \to \bar{u}u, \bar{d}d, \bar{s}s, \bar{c}c, \bar{\tau}\tau, \bar{\mu}\mu, \bar{e}e \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( \bar{b}b \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( \bar{c}c, \bar{s}s, \bar{u}u, \bar{d}d, \bar{\tau}\tau, \bar{\mu}\mu, \bar{e}e \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( \bar{t}t \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( \bar{b}b \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \).
