Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll visualize the target molecule. The structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a methyl group attached to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl), and that methyl has a hydroxyl group (hydroxy). Also, there's a formyl group (carbaldehyde) attached to the same carbon as the cyclohexylmethyl group. Wait, no, wait—the formula says 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group which is attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the main ring also has a carbaldehyde group, so a -CHO attached at position 1 as well.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me parse the name again. The main chain or ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the parent is cyclohexane with a carbaldehyde group. The substituent is at position 1: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -CHO at carbon 1, and also a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group at carbon 1. So carbon 1 has two substituents: a formyl group and a methyl group that's substituted with OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, but that can't be right because having two substituents on the same carbon in cyclohexane might not be possible unless it's a bridge structure or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the main chain is cyclohexane, and the substituent is a branch at position 1, which is a methyl group that has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the structure is something like:

cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1: a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH, and another H is replaced by cyclohexyl. But wait, that would make it a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. But wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a methyl group (CH2-) which has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl attached. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with OH and cyclohexyl attached, so it's CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Wait, no, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I don't need to get too bogged down right now. Let me think about the starting material and the possible reactions.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to figure out the reagents that would take this to the target molecule. Let's look at the options and see what each reagent does.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of four steps. Let me think about each step.

First, I'll think about what transformations are needed. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, what do I do? Let's see:

The target has a formyl group and a substituted methyl group. So perhaps I need to add some groups step by step.

Option A's reagents: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So the first step could be alkylation. Maybe adding a methyl group somewhere. Then H2/Pd is hydrogenation, so reducing triple bonds to single bonds. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide opening, but more likely for elimination (like in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's more for ketones). Wait, or perhaps it's used in epoxide ring opening, but I'm not sure. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O would be a hydration condition, perhaps for a carbonyl formation.

Wait, but let me think about the steps for each option.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride. 2. Li/liquid NH3. 3. O3/H2O. 4. NH4OH.

NaNH2 with ethyl chloride is perhaps an alkylation, adding an ethyl group. Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base used for elimination (like the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation) or for conjugate additions. Ozone (O3) followed by workup (H2O) is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Then NH4OH is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. 3. O3/(CH3)2S. 4. Ba(OH)2.

So first step is alkylation. Second step is hydrogenation, perhaps reducing a triple bond. O3 with (CH3)2S as a workup (which is a reductive workup, gives aldehydes/ketones without over-oxidizing). Then Ba(OH)2 maybe for elimination.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol. 2. Li/liq. NH3. 3. O3/(CH3)2S. 4. NH4OH.

NaNH2 with methanol—could that be a methylation? Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps deprotonating something. Methanol as a methylating agent, but maybe for alkylation. Then Li in NH3 is for elimination. O3 gives ozonolysis, and then NH4OH is something else.

Wait, but let me think about the target molecule again. It has two substituents: a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So maybe the ethynylcyclohexane can be functionalized to add these groups.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH). Maybe we can perform some alkylation or addition to this.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized. For example, adding a methyl group via alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond can be used to form a ketone via hydration.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps for each option.

Option C's steps: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That would deprotonate something and add methyl. But on ethynylcyclohexane, where would the proton be? The ethynyl group is sp-hybridized, so the protons are acidic. Deprotonating with NaNH2 (a strong base) would give a cyclohexenide (or cyclohexynide) anion. Then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH (actually, it's cyclohexylacetylene, I think).

Deprotonating the ethynyl group with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexynide anion. Then methyl chloride would methylate it. So the product would be cyclohexylidene (maybe a cyclopropenyl group?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being alkylated. Wait, but alkylation of terminal alkynes is possible, but usually done with a metal catalyst, like in a Sonogashira coupling. But NaNH2 is a base, perhaps for deprotonating and then methylating. So after step 1, we would have (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me.

Then step 2 is H2 with Pd on calcium carbonate, which is a hydrogenation catalyst. So H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. A triple bond can be hydrogenated to a single bond, but usually requires high pressure and catalysts. So the alkyne (C≡C) becomes a single bond. So our structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me? Or cyclohexyl-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, the alkyne would become a trans-alkene upon partial hydrogenation, but with excess H2, it would become a single bond.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane after alkylation becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Hydrogenation would reduce it to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the methyl. So the alkyne is R-C≡CH; after alkylation, it would be R-C≡CMe. Then hydrogenation would turn it into R-CMe2. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CMe2. Wait, no, wait: R-C≡C-Me becomes R-CH2-CH2-Me upon hydrogenation. So R is cyclohexyl in this case.

So after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to match the target molecule. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group which also has an OH group. So perhaps after this, we need to introduce an OH group.

Looking at step 3 of option C: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But in our case, if the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do much. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the hydrogenation wasn't complete. Or maybe the initial steps are different.

Wait another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone. Because sometimes, terminal alkynes can be hydrated to ketones using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration of terminal alkynes gives ketones). But in option C, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let's consider each option and see which sequence of reactions would lead to the target.

The target has a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form the CHO group via some oxidation or hydration, and the cyclohexyl group is introduced via alkylation.

But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So perhaps the triple bond is functionalized to add the formyl group.

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a ketone via hydration. So adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 would give a cyclohexylpropanone? Or perhaps cyclohexylacetone. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Hydration would add an OH across the triple bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH(OH)CH3, but wait that's not correct because hydration of a triple bond typically gives a ketone. Wait, no, wait: hydration of ethyne (HC≡CH) gives ketone (CH3CO), but for an internal alkyne, you get a ketone. But ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so hydration would give a ketone as well. So cyclohexyl-C(O)CH3.

Wait, but let me think. The triple bond is at the end, so hydration would give a ketone. So the product would be cyclohexylacetyl group, which is cyclohexane-C(O)-CH3.

But let's check the options: none of the options have a step that includes H2SO4 and HgSO4 except option A, which uses them in step 4.

Wait, option A's steps are: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

But in the target molecule, there's a formyl group. So perhaps the ketone is converted into an aldehyde. That would involve some reduction or oxidation. Wait, but how? Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then some ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, going back to option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and MeOH. NaNH2 is a strong base, MeOH is a methylating agent. So perhaps deprotonating the ethynyl proton and then methylating to get a gem-dimethyl group. So the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a Birch reduction condition, but more likely used for elimination. Alternatively, it's a strong base causing elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So if we have R-C≡C-Me, and then eliminate, perhaps converting the alkyne into an alkene. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Li in NH3 can be used for dehydrohalogenation, but I don't have any halogens here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene upon partial hydrogenation. Wait, step 2 in D is Li in liquid NH3. Maybe that's a different reaction. Li in NH3 is often used for deprotonating and forming enolates, or for the Birch reduction (which is for aromatic rings), but in this case, it's an alkyne attached to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's usually with Mg.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in D is a hydrogenation step, but I'm not sure. Another thought: Maybe the tripe bond is hydrogenated to a single bond (so it becomes R-CH2-CH2-Me). Then, ozonolysis would have to act on a double bond, but if the molecule is a single bond, that wouldn't work. So perhaps that's not the case.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group, which suggests that perhaps the triple bond was converted into a carbonyl group, perhaps via hydration or oxidation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, and then further functionalized.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

NaNH2 is a strong base, which deprotonates the alkyne's acidic hydrogen. Then, methyl chloride would methylate the alkyne, giving a gem-dimethyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2 with Pd catalyst. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

But the target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl substituent. So perhaps I need to introduce an OH group and a CHO group.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, we can perform some oxidation or other reactions.

Wait, but looking at option C, after step 2 (hydrogenation), step 3 is ozonolysis. But ozonolysis requires a double bond, which isn't present in cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial alkyne is converted into a diol or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces alkyne to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but there's no double bond here, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding step 3. Wait, maybe in step 2, the alkyne is partially hydrogenated to a double bond. Oh, right! Because hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst can stop at the cis-alkene if the conditions are controlled (like using Lindlar's catalyst for cis addition, but Pd is usually for full hydrogenation). But if the catalyst is Pd, perhaps it would go all the way to the single bond. So in that case, no double bond exists, and ozonolysis wouldn't work. So that's a problem for option C.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe methylates the alkyne. So we get cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe for elimination, but without any leaving groups, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I don't think that applies here.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → again, needs a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps in step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. But I'm not sure if Pd would do that. Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are different.

Let me think about option B.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylates the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps hydrogenation to cis-alkene? Or elimination.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reducing carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's imagine the steps.

After step 1, we have R-C≡C-Et. Step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe that's used for elimination, converting the alkyne into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but we don't have a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation, but Li in NH3 isn't a hydrogenation catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by an elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene. So R-C≡C-Et → R-CH₂-CH₂-Et via hydrogenation. Then ozonolysis would need a double bond, which we don't have. Hmm.

Let me think about option A.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → possibly for elimination, like forming a double bond. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination to form an alkene. So R-CH2-CH2-Me → R-CH2-CH2-Me after elimination? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, maybe it's a oxidation step. Ba(OH)2 could be involved in oxidation, but more likely, it's for elimination. So if R-CH2-CH2-Me is treated with a strong base, perhaps it forms an alkene via elimination, but where would the H come from? Maybe it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Ba(OH)2 could be used to form epoxides from alkenes, but that's not applicable if there's no alkene.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. The substituent is a CH2 group attached to both OH and cyclohexyl. So perhaps we need to form a secondary alcohol.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then into an alcohol, which is then oxidized. Or perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes some aldol reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a formyl group. How? Maybe via oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Think about the overall process.

We start with ethynylcyclohexane. We need to add a methyl group (from methyl chloride in NaNH2 conditions), then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. Then, perhaps introduce an OH group and a formyl group.

Wait, looking at option D: after step 2 (Li in NH3), perhaps the compound is now an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me consider option D’s steps again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → alkylates the alkyne, so R-C≡C-OCH3? Or R-C≡C-Me? Wait, methanol is CH3OH. So maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. The alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2, then reacts with methanol. But wait, methanol isn't an alkyl halide. Oh wait, no, the reagent is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the steps that would form the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group and a formyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group, and a cyclohexyl group is added.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone via hydration, which is then oxidized to a formyl group. But how?

Wait, let me think about option C again. Let's imagine:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But there's no double bond here, so this step doesn't do anything. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion. Maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. So step 2 would give cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a different reaction. Wait, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is a typical catalyst for hydrogenation, but perhaps in this case, it's used for dehydrogenation, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is different. Let me think about option D again. Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's a way to form a gem-dimethyl group. Then step 2, Li in NH3, which could be a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't have a halogen.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reagents and what each could do.

Looking for the formyl group: perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group. So, through hydration or oxidation.

Hydration of a triple bond typically gives a ketone. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 would give cyclohexylacetone (cyclohexane-C(O)-CH3). Then, maybe that ketone is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, but I don't see an option that includes that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted into an aldehyde. To do that, you can reduce the ketone. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would give a secondary alcohol, not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is cleaved.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group, then cleaved via ozonolysis.

Wait, for example, if the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, perhaps via a dihydroxylation or some other process.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde. How?

Wait, maybe via the Stephen reduction, which reduces a ketone to an aldehyde, but that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then into an aldehyde via some reaction.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps in option D.

Option D: steps 1-4.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. If we treat ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, the alkyne is deprotonated to form a cyclohexynide anion. Then, methanol (CH3OH) is a methylating agent. So the anion would attack the CH3O- group? Or perhaps it's a SN2 reaction. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating and then a methyl group is added. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexylidene (maybe a cyclohexylidenemethane?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard-like reagent, but that's usually done with Mg. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to form a gem-dimethyl group.

Wait, after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. I'm not sure what this does. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, which would reduce the ring, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be a strong base causing elimination. But without a leaving group, that's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but again, no halogen.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used in a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but without a leaving group, perhaps it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene. But I'm not certain about that.

Hmm, perhaps I can think about the target molecule and see what reactions would build it.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which also has an OH group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group, then functionalized.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl is first hydrogenated to a CH2 group (single bond), then functionalized.

If I start with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 could be hydrogenation to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3. But that's ethylcyclohexane, which doesn't have any functional groups. Then, perhaps I need to add substituents.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the formyl group. So perhaps I need to form a ring-opening or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct option by considering the possible steps that each option offers.

Let me think about option C again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → gives R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond here. Unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate, leaving a double bond. But H2/Pd would usually go to single bond.

Hmm.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → maybe forms an alkene via elimination.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → reduces carbonyls to alcohols.

So let's imagine this. After step 1, R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps converts the alkyne into an alkene. So R-CH2-CH2-Et? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's R-C=C-Et. If the alkyne is converted into an alkene, then step 3 (ozonolysis) would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So if we have R-CH2-CH2-Et (from hydrogenation), that doesn't have a double bond. But if step 2 is elimination, maybe converting the alkyne into an alkene, then step 3 would cleave that.

Wait, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure how that would happen without a halogen.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene stage. So R-C≡C-Et → R-CH₂-CH₂-Et upon full hydrogenation, but I don't see any double bond in that case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But looking at the options, the last step in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's typical for hydrating a triple bond into a ketone, but perhaps in another context.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the target structure and how to form it from ethynylcyclohexane.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So the main ring is cyclohexane with a -CHO group at position 1. Also attached to position 1 is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the structure would be:

cyclohexane ring with two substituents at position 1: a -CHO and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Wait, that's impossible because a carbon can't have two substituents at the same position in a cyclohexane. So perhaps they're on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are on different positions, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring, and the formyl group is on the same carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents that would introduce an aldehyde group and an alcohol with a cyclohexyl group.

Option C's steps:

After step 2, we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ozone. But no double bond, so nothing happens. So that's not helpful.

Option B's steps:

After step 3, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups. So perhaps step 2 forms a double bond.

Wait, step 2 in option B is Li in liq. NH3. Maybe that's a Birch reduction, which would hydrogenate the alkyne into a cis-alkene? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by elimination, forming a double bond.

If step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So let me imagine:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → R-C≡C-R'.

Step 2: treatment with Li in NH3 → R-CH₂-CH₂-R' with a double bond? Or R-CH₂-CH₂-R' → R-CH₂-CH₂-R' without any change? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene. Then step 3 cleaves the double bond with ozone into two carbonyl groups.

So, if after step 2, the molecule is R-CH₂-CH₂-R' with a double bond, say R-CH₂-CH₂-R' → R-CH₂-CH₂-R' after hydrogenation? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. But without a leaving group, that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene stage. So R-C≡C-Et → R-CH₂-CH-Et (but I'm not sure about that).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the steps in option B.

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So R-C≡C-H → R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → maybe deprotonates and forms a lithium amide, but not sure.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond present, it would form two carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → might reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the target molecule, there's a formyl group (aldehyde) and a secondary alcohol. So perhaps ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups, and one is reduced to an alcohol.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target structure.

Hmm, another approach. Let me think about the correct order of reactions to form the target.

The target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group attached to the main ring. So perhaps one of the substituents is introduced via alkylation, and the other via oxidation or functionalization.

Let me think about the steps needed:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne, perhaps via alkylation.

2. Reduce the alkyne to a trans-alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Reduce one carbonyl group to an alcohol and the other to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the options.

Wait, looking again at option C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction. So this can't be right.

Option D:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → R-C≡C-OCH3? Or R-C≡C-Me.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe deprotonates and forms a lithium amide.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of an epoxide in the reaction steps, but I don't see that in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a formyl group via a series of steps.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group, then the carbonyl is further functionalized.

For example, using the oxymercuration reaction, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps via oxidation.

Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride: that's alkylation. Then hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond. Then Ba(OH)2 could induce some elimination, perhaps forming an alkene.

Wait, option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. So if step 2 produces R-CH2-CH2-Me, then step 3 could deprotonate to form an alkene via elimination. But elimination would require a good leaving group, which isn't present in R-CH2-CH2-Me. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option and see which one logically leads to the target structure.

The target has both a formyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexylmethyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the formyl group, and the cyclohexyl group is introduced via alkylation.

Looking at option C again:

1. Alkyne is methylated → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenated → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis → nothing happens, since no double bond. So this doesn't make sense.

Option D:

1. Alkyne methylated → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Li in NH3 → not sure.

3. Ozonolysis → again, no double bond.

Hmm.

Option B:

1. Alkyne ethylated → R-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe forms an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves into two carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → reduces to alcohols.

So, if after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-Et with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. Then, reducing with NH4OH would give two alcohols.

But the target has a formyl group and a secondary alcohol. So perhaps one of the carbonyls is an aldehyde and the other is a ketone. Then, the aldehyde remains as is, and the ketone is converted into an alcohol.

But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step and how it contributes to the target.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which has an OH, and the same carbon has a formyl group.

Wait, maybe the formyl group comes from the alkyne via hydration and oxidation, while the cyclohexyl group comes from alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then oxidized to a carboxylic acid, then reduced to an aldehyde. But I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via some other method.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule's structure suggests that the starting alkyne is converted into a side chain that includes both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Perhaps the ethynyl group is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, then ozonolyzed to form the carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis requires a double bond. So perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond that can be cleaved.

Wait, maybe the initial alkyne is converted into a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, but in that case, the hydrogenation would stop at the alkene stage. So step 2 in option C is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to a single bond, not leaving a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me try to imagine each step.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces alkyne to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens. That can't be right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 of option C doesn't fully reduce the alkyne, leaving a double bond. But I don't think that's the case with H2/Pd.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps forms an alkene via elimination.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → reduces carbonyls to alcohols.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps form a dienol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this and should look for the sequence that forms both the formyl and the hydroxymethyl groups.

Looking back, the target has a formyl group and a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps involves the formation of a carbonyl group, and another step involves the formation of an alcohol.

The correct sequence would involve:

1. Alkylating the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Reducing the alkyne to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Reducing some carbonyls to alcohols.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a CH2OH group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which is then opened by a nucleophile. But that's not in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, which is then reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, option A's steps include H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O in step 4. That's the hydration condition for a triple bond, which would form a ketone. So perhaps:

Step 1: Alkylation of the alkyne to form R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond? But R-CH2-CH2-Me can't eliminate to form a double bond easily.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another thought: The target has a formyl group and a secondary alcohol. So perhaps one of the carbonyl groups from ozonolysis is reduced to an aldehyde, and another to an alcohol.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me try to think through it again.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → nothing since no double bond.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → possibly elimination if there's a structure that allows it. But I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option's final steps.

Option C has step 4 as Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base used in elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alcohols or other structures.

So perhaps after step 3, which in option C is ozonolysis, which forms carbonyl groups, step 4 would do something else.

But I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the possible steps.

The target has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps forms a carbonyl group. Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration of a triple bond to form a ketone.

So, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 could be alkylation to add a methyl group, making it R-C≡C-Me. Then step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to R-CH2-CH2-Me. Step 3 would be Ba(OH)2, which I'm not sure about, but perhaps it's for elimination. Then step 4 hydrates any triple bond, but if the triple bond is already hydrogenated, that wouldn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 in option A is for epoxidation, but I'm not certain.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the option that includes both alkylation and oxidation to form the formyl group.

Wait, another thought: The target has a formyl group, which could come from the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps one of the steps is the oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is for hydrating a triple bond to a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which could reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, but not directly an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonates and forms a lithium amide, then maybe adds something else. Not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → cleaves a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → reduces carbonyls to alcohols.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target's structure again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group that also has a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group, then an OH group is added.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond.

3. The resulting compound is ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

4. The carbonyl groups are reduced to alcohols.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis won't work.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess. Based on the steps and the target, I think option C is the correct one. Because after alkylating the alkyne, hydrogenating, and then performing ozonolysis (which I might have misunderstood), it could produce the necessary groups.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent at position 1. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but no clear pathway for forming the target structure.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration conditions, typically for converting alkynes to ketones, but the alkyne is already hydrogenated, making this step redundant.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the ethynyl group with an ethyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Et.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after the previous steps.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, but the sequence does not explain how the formyl group or the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group is formed.

This sequence does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the ethynyl group with a methyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but no double bond is present after hydrogenation, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but no clear pathway to form the target structure.

This sequence does not successfully produce the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after the previous steps.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, but the sequence does not explain how the formyl group or the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group is formed.

This sequence also does not align with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary intermediates, even though the exact transformations are unclear.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll visualize the target molecule. The structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a methyl group attached to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl), and that methyl has a hydroxyl group (hydroxy). Also, there's a formyl group (carbaldehyde) attached to the same carbon as the cyclohexylmethyl group. Wait, no, wait—the formula says 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group which is attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the main ring also has a carbaldehyde group, so a -CHO attached at position 1 as well.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me parse the name again. The main chain or ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the parent is cyclohexane with a carbaldehyde group. The substituent is at position 1: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -CHO at carbon 1, and also a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group at carbon 1. So carbon 1 has two substituents: a formyl group and a methyl group that's substituted with OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, but that can't be right because having two substituents on the same carbon in cyclohexane might not be possible unless it's a bridge structure or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the main chain is cyclohexane, and the substituent is a branch at position 1, which is a methyl group that has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the structure is something like:

cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1: a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH, and another H is replaced by cyclohexyl. But wait, that would make it a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. But wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a methyl group (CH2-) which has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl attached. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with OH and cyclohexyl attached, so it's CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Wait, no, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I don't need to get too bogged down right now. Let me think about the starting material and the possible reactions.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to figure out the reagents that would take this to the target molecule. Let's look at the options and see what each reagent does.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of four steps. Let me think about each step.

First, I'll think about what transformations are needed. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, what do I do? Let's see:

The target has a formyl group and a substituted methyl group. So perhaps I need to add some groups step by step.

Option A's reagents: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So the first step could be alkylation. Maybe adding a methyl group somewhere. Then H2/Pd is hydrogenation, so reducing triple bonds to single bonds. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide opening, but more likely for elimination (like in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's more for ketones). Wait, or perhaps it's used in epoxide ring opening, but I'm not sure. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O would be a hydration condition, perhaps for a carbonyl formation.

Wait, but let me think about the steps for each option.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride. 2. Li/liquid NH3. 3. O3/H2O. 4. NH4OH.

NaNH2 with ethyl chloride is perhaps an alkylation, adding an ethyl group. Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base used for elimination (like the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation) or for conjugate additions. Ozone (O3) followed by workup (H2O) is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Then NH4OH is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. 3. O3/(CH3)2S. 4. Ba(OH)2.

So first step is alkylation. Second step is hydrogenation, perhaps reducing a triple bond. O3 with (CH3)2S as a workup (which is a reductive workup, gives aldehydes/ketones without over-oxidizing). Then Ba(OH)2 maybe for elimination.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol. 2. Li/liq. NH3. 3. O3/(CH3)2S. 4. NH4OH.

NaNH2 with methanol—could that be a methylation? Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps deprotonating something. Methanol as a methylating agent, but maybe for alkylation. Then Li in NH3 is for elimination. O3 gives ozonolysis, and then NH4OH is something else.

Wait, but let me think about the target molecule again. It has two substituents: a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So maybe the ethynylcyclohexane can be functionalized to add these groups.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH). Maybe we can perform some alkylation or addition to this.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized. For example, adding a methyl group via alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond can be used to form a ketone via hydration.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps for each option.

Option C's steps: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That would deprotonate something and add methyl. But on ethynylcyclohexane, where would the proton be? The ethynyl group is sp-hybridized, so the protons are acidic. Deprotonating with NaNH2 (a strong base) would give a cyclohexenide (or cyclohexynide) anion. Then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH (actually, it's cyclohexylacetylene, I think).

Deprotonating the ethynyl group with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexynide anion. Then methyl chloride would methylate it. So the product would be cyclohexylidene (maybe a cyclopropenyl group?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being alkylated. Wait, but alkylation of terminal alkynes is possible, but usually done with a metal catalyst, like in a Sonogashira coupling. But NaNH2 is a base, perhaps for deprotonating and then methylating. So after step 1, we would have (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me.

Then step 2 is H2 with Pd on calcium carbonate, which is a hydrogenation catalyst. So H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond. A triple bond can be hydrogenated to a single bond, but usually requires high pressure and catalysts. So the alkyne (C≡C) becomes a single bond. So our structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me? Or cyclohexyl-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, the alkyne would become a trans-alkene upon partial hydrogenation, but with excess H2, it would become a single bond.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane after alkylation becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Hydrogenation would reduce it to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the methyl. So the alkyne is R-C≡CH; after alkylation, it would be R-C≡CMe. Then hydrogenation would turn it into R-CMe2. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CMe2. Wait, no, wait: R-C≡C-Me becomes R-CH2-CH2-Me upon hydrogenation. So R is cyclohexyl in this case.

So after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to match the target molecule. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group which also has an OH group. So perhaps after this, we need to introduce an OH group.

Looking at step 3 of option C: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But in our case, if the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do much. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the hydrogenation wasn't complete. Or maybe the initial steps are different.

Wait another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone. Because sometimes, terminal alkynes can be hydrated to ketones using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration of terminal alkynes gives ketones). But in option C, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let's consider each option and see which sequence of reactions would lead to the target.

The target has a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form the CHO group via some oxidation or hydration, and the cyclohexyl group is introduced via alkylation.

But wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So perhaps the triple bond is functionalized to add the formyl group.

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a ketone via hydration. So adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 would give a cyclohexylpropanone? Or perhaps cyclohexylacetone. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Hydration would add an OH across the triple bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH(OH)CH3, but wait that's not correct because hydration of a triple bond typically gives a ketone. Wait, no, wait: hydration of ethyne (HC≡CH) gives ketone (CH3CO), but for an internal alkyne, you get a ketone. But ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so hydration would give a ketone as well. So cyclohexyl-C(O)CH3.

Wait, but let me think. The triple bond is at the end, so hydration would give a ketone. So the product would be cyclohexylacetyl group, which is cyclohexane-C(O)-CH3.

But let's check the options: none of the options have a step that includes H2SO4 and HgSO4 except option A, which uses them in step 4.

Wait, option A's steps are: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

But in the target molecule, there's a formyl group. So perhaps the ketone is converted into an aldehyde. That would involve some reduction or oxidation. Wait, but how? Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a single bond, then some ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, going back to option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 and MeOH. NaNH2 is a strong base, MeOH is a methylating agent. So perhaps deprotonating the ethynyl proton and then methylating to get a gem-dimethyl group. So the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a Birch reduction condition, but more likely used for elimination. Alternatively, it's a strong base causing elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So if we have R-C≡C-Me, and then eliminate, perhaps converting the alkyne into an alkene. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Li in NH3 can be used for dehydrohalogenation, but I don't have any halogens here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene upon partial hydrogenation. Wait, step 2 in D is Li in liquid NH3. Maybe that's a different reaction. Li in NH3 is often used for deprotonating and forming enolates, or for the Birch reduction (which is for aromatic rings), but in this case, it's an alkyne attached to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's usually with Mg.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in D is a hydrogenation step, but I'm not sure. Another thought: Maybe the tripe bond is hydrogenated to a single bond (so it becomes R-CH2-CH2-Me). Then, ozonolysis would have to act on a double bond, but if the molecule is a single bond, that wouldn't work. So perhaps that's not the case.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group, which suggests that perhaps the triple bond was converted into a carbonyl group, perhaps via hydration or oxidation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, and then further functionalized.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

NaNH2 is a strong base, which deprotonates the alkyne's acidic hydrogen. Then, methyl chloride would methylate the alkyne, giving a gem-dimethyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2 with Pd catalyst. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

But the target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl substituent. So perhaps I need to introduce an OH group and a CHO group.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, we can perform some oxidation or other reactions.

Wait, but looking at option C, after step 2 (hydrogenation), step 3 is ozonolysis. But ozonolysis requires a double bond, which isn't present in cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial alkyne is converted into a diol or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces alkyne to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but there's no double bond here, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding step 3. Wait, maybe in step 2, the alkyne is partially hydrogenated to a double bond. Oh, right! Because hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst can stop at the cis-alkene if the conditions are controlled (like using Lindlar's catalyst for cis addition, but Pd is usually for full hydrogenation). But if the catalyst is Pd, perhaps it would go all the way to the single bond. So in that case, no double bond exists, and ozonolysis wouldn't work. So that's a problem for option C.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe methylates the alkyne. So we get cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe for elimination, but without any leaving groups, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I don't think that applies here.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → again, needs a double bond.

Hmm, perhaps in step 2, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. But I'm not sure if Pd would do that. Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are different.

Let me think about option B.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylates the alkyne to cyclohexyl-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps hydrogenation to cis-alkene? Or elimination.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reducing carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's imagine the steps.

After step 1, we have R-C≡C-Et. Step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe that's used for elimination, converting the alkyne into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but we don't have a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation, but Li in NH3 isn't a hydrogenation catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by an elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene. So R-C≡C-Et → R-CH₂-CH₂-Et via hydrogenation. Then ozonolysis would need a double bond, which we don't have. Hmm.

Let me think about option A.

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ba(OH)2 → possibly for elimination, like forming a double bond. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps causing elimination to form an alkene. So R-CH2-CH2-Me → R-CH2-CH2-Me after elimination? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, maybe it's a oxidation step. Ba(OH)2 could be involved in oxidation, but more likely, it's for elimination. So if R-CH2-CH2-Me is treated with a strong base, perhaps it forms an alkene via elimination, but where would the H come from? Maybe it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Ba(OH)2 could be used to form epoxides from alkenes, but that's not applicable if there's no alkene.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. The substituent is a CH2 group attached to both OH and cyclohexyl. So perhaps we need to form a secondary alcohol.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then into an alcohol, which is then oxidized. Or perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes some aldol reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a formyl group. How? Maybe via oxidation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Think about the overall process.

We start with ethynylcyclohexane. We need to add a methyl group (from methyl chloride in NaNH2 conditions), then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. Then, perhaps introduce an OH group and a formyl group.

Wait, looking at option D: after step 2 (Li in NH3), perhaps the compound is now an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me consider option D’s steps again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → alkylates the alkyne, so R-C≡C-OCH3? Or R-C≡C-Me? Wait, methanol is CH3OH. So maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. The alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2, then reacts with methanol. But wait, methanol isn't an alkyl halide. Oh wait, no, the reagent is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe it's a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the steps that would form the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group and a formyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a formyl group, and a cyclohexyl group is added.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone via hydration, which is then oxidized to a formyl group. But how?

Wait, let me think about option C again. Let's imagine:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But there's no double bond here, so this step doesn't do anything. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion. Maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. So step 2 would give cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a different reaction. Wait, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is a typical catalyst for hydrogenation, but perhaps in this case, it's used for dehydrogenation, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is different. Let me think about option D again. Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's a way to form a gem-dimethyl group. Then step 2, Li in NH3, which could be a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't have a halogen.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reagents and what each could do.

Looking for the formyl group: perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group. So, through hydration or oxidation.

Hydration of a triple bond typically gives a ketone. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 would give cyclohexylacetone (cyclohexane-C(O)-CH3). Then, maybe that ketone is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, but I don't see an option that includes that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is converted into an aldehyde. To do that, you can reduce the ketone. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would give a secondary alcohol, not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is cleaved.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group, then cleaved via ozonolysis.

Wait, for example, if the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, perhaps via a dihydroxylation or some other process.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde. How?

Wait, maybe via the Stephen reduction, which reduces a ketone to an aldehyde, but that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then into an aldehyde via some reaction.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps in option D.

Option D: steps 1-4.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. If we treat ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, the alkyne is deprotonated to form a cyclohexynide anion. Then, methanol (CH3OH) is a methylating agent. So the anion would attack the CH3O- group? Or perhaps it's a SN2 reaction. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating and then a methyl group is added. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexylidene (maybe a cyclohexylidenemethane?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard-like reagent, but that's usually done with Mg. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is alkylated to form a gem-dimethyl group.

Wait, after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. I'm not sure what this does. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, which would reduce the ring, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, Li in NH3 could be a strong base causing elimination. But without a leaving group, that's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but again, no halogen.

Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is used in a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but without a leaving group, perhaps it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene. But I'm not certain about that.

Hmm, perhaps I can think about the target molecule and see what reactions would build it.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which also has an OH group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group, then functionalized.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl is first hydrogenated to a CH2 group (single bond), then functionalized.

If I start with ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 could be hydrogenation to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3. But that's ethylcyclohexane, which doesn't have any functional groups. Then, perhaps I need to add substituents.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the formyl group. So perhaps I need to form a ring-opening or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct option by considering the possible steps that each option offers.

Let me think about option C again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → gives R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → reduces to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond here. Unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate, leaving a double bond. But H2/Pd would usually go to single bond.

Hmm.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → maybe forms an alkene via elimination.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → reduces carbonyls to alcohols.

So let's imagine this. After step 1, R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps converts the alkyne into an alkene. So R-CH2-CH2-Et? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's R-C=C-Et. If the alkyne is converted into an alkene, then step 3 (ozonolysis) would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So if we have R-CH2-CH2-Et (from hydrogenation), that doesn't have a double bond. But if step 2 is elimination, maybe converting the alkyne into an alkene, then step 3 would cleave that.

Wait, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure how that would happen without a halogen.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene stage. So R-C≡C-Et → R-CH₂-CH₂-Et upon full hydrogenation, but I don't see any double bond in that case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But looking at the options, the last step in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's typical for hydrating a triple bond into a ketone, but perhaps in another context.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the target structure and how to form it from ethynylcyclohexane.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So the main ring is cyclohexane with a -CHO group at position 1. Also attached to position 1 is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the structure would be:

cyclohexane ring with two substituents at position 1: a -CHO and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Wait, that's impossible because a carbon can't have two substituents at the same position in a cyclohexane. So perhaps they're on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are on different positions, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring, and the formyl group is on the same carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents that would introduce an aldehyde group and an alcohol with a cyclohexyl group.

Option C's steps:

After step 2, we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ozone. But no double bond, so nothing happens. So that's not helpful.

Option B's steps:

After step 3, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups. So perhaps step 2 forms a double bond.

Wait, step 2 in option B is Li in liq. NH3. Maybe that's a Birch reduction, which would hydrogenate the alkyne into a cis-alkene? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by elimination, forming a double bond.

If step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So let me imagine:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → R-C≡C-R'.

Step 2: treatment with Li in NH3 → R-CH₂-CH₂-R' with a double bond? Or R-CH₂-CH₂-R' → R-CH₂-CH₂-R' without any change? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into a trans-alkene. Then step 3 cleaves the double bond with ozone into two carbonyl groups.

So, if after step 2, the molecule is R-CH₂-CH₂-R' with a double bond, say R-CH₂-CH₂-R' → R-CH₂-CH₂-R' after hydrogenation? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. But without a leaving group, that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene stage. So R-C≡C-Et → R-CH₂-CH-Et (but I'm not sure about that).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the steps in option B.

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So R-C≡C-H → R-C≡C-Et.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3 → maybe deprotonates and forms a lithium amide, but not sure.

Step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond present, it would form two carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → might reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but in the target molecule, there's a formyl group (aldehyde) and a secondary alcohol. So perhaps ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups, and one is reduced to an alcohol.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target structure.

Hmm, another approach. Let me think about the correct order of reactions to form the target.

The target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group attached to the main ring. So perhaps one of the substituents is introduced via alkylation, and the other via oxidation or functionalization.

Let me think about the steps needed:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne, perhaps via alkylation.

2. Reduce the alkyne to a trans-alkene.

3. Ozonolyze the alkene to form two carbonyl groups.

4. Reduce one carbonyl group to an alcohol and the other to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how that would fit into the options.

Wait, looking again at option C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction. So this can't be right.

Option D:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → R-C≡C-OCH3? Or R-C≡C-Me.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe deprotonates and forms a lithium amide.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of an epoxide in the reaction steps, but I don't see that in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a formyl group via a series of steps.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group, then the carbonyl is further functionalized.

For example, using the oxymercuration reaction, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps via oxidation.

Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride: that's alkylation. Then hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond. Then Ba(OH)2 could induce some elimination, perhaps forming an alkene.

Wait, option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. So if step 2 produces R-CH2-CH2-Me, then step 3 could deprotonate to form an alkene via elimination. But elimination would require a good leaving group, which isn't present in R-CH2-CH2-Me. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option and see which one logically leads to the target structure.

The target has both a formyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexylmethyl group. So perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into the formyl group, and the cyclohexyl group is introduced via alkylation.

Looking at option C again:

1. Alkyne is methylated → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenated → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis → nothing happens, since no double bond. So this doesn't make sense.

Option D:

1. Alkyne methylated → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Li in NH3 → not sure.

3. Ozonolysis → again, no double bond.

Hmm.

Option B:

1. Alkyne ethylated → R-C≡C-Et.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe forms an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves into two carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → reduces to alcohols.

So, if after step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-Et with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. Then, reducing with NH4OH would give two alcohols.

But the target has a formyl group and a secondary alcohol. So perhaps one of the carbonyls is an aldehyde and the other is a ketone. Then, the aldehyde remains as is, and the ketone is converted into an alcohol.

But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step and how it contributes to the target.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which has an OH, and the same carbon has a formyl group.

Wait, maybe the formyl group comes from the alkyne via hydration and oxidation, while the cyclohexyl group comes from alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then oxidized to a carboxylic acid, then reduced to an aldehyde. But I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via some other method.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule's structure suggests that the starting alkyne is converted into a side chain that includes both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Perhaps the ethynyl group is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, then ozonolyzed to form the carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis requires a double bond. So perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond that can be cleaved.

Wait, maybe the initial alkyne is converted into a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, but in that case, the hydrogenation would stop at the alkene stage. So step 2 in option C is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to a single bond, not leaving a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me try to imagine each step.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces alkyne to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens. That can't be right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 of option C doesn't fully reduce the alkyne, leaving a double bond. But I don't think that's the case with H2/Pd.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps forms an alkene via elimination.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → reduces carbonyls to alcohols.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps form a dienol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this and should look for the sequence that forms both the formyl and the hydroxymethyl groups.

Looking back, the target has a formyl group and a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps involves the formation of a carbonyl group, and another step involves the formation of an alcohol.

The correct sequence would involve:

1. Alkylating the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Reducing the alkyne to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Reducing some carbonyls to alcohols.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a CH2OH group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which is then opened by a nucleophile. But that's not in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, which is then reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, option A's steps include H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O in step 4. That's the hydration condition for a triple bond, which would form a ketone. So perhaps:

Step 1: Alkylation of the alkyne to form R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond? But R-CH2-CH2-Me can't eliminate to form a double bond easily.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another thought: The target has a formyl group and a secondary alcohol. So perhaps one of the carbonyl groups from ozonolysis is reduced to an aldehyde, and another to an alcohol.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me try to think through it again.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkyne becomes R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → nothing since no double bond.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → possibly elimination if there's a structure that allows it. But I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option's final steps.

Option C has step 4 as Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base used in elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alcohols or other structures.

So perhaps after step 3, which in option C is ozonolysis, which forms carbonyl groups, step 4 would do something else.

But I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the possible steps.

The target has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps forms a carbonyl group. Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration of a triple bond to form a ketone.

So, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, step 1 could be alkylation to add a methyl group, making it R-C≡C-Me. Then step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond to R-CH2-CH2-Me. Step 3 would be Ba(OH)2, which I'm not sure about, but perhaps it's for elimination. Then step 4 hydrates any triple bond, but if the triple bond is already hydrogenated, that wouldn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 in option A is for epoxidation, but I'm not certain.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for the option that includes both alkylation and oxidation to form the formyl group.

Wait, another thought: The target has a formyl group, which could come from the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps one of the steps is the oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is for hydrating a triple bond to a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH, which could reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, but not directly an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonates and forms a lithium amide, then maybe adds something else. Not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → cleaves a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → reduces carbonyls to alcohols.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the target's structure again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group that also has a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group, then an OH group is added.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond.

3. The resulting compound is ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

4. The carbonyl groups are reduced to alcohols.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis won't work.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess. Based on the steps and the target, I think option C is the correct one. Because after alkylating the alkyne, hydrogenating, and then performing ozonolysis (which I might have misunderstood), it could produce the necessary groups.


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl substituent at position 1. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but no clear pathway for forming the target structure.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration conditions, typically for converting alkynes to ketones, but the alkyne is already hydrogenated, making this step redundant.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the ethynyl group with an ethyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Et.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but no double bond is present after the previous steps.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, but the sequence does not explain how the formyl group or the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group is formed.

This sequence does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the ethynyl group with a methyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but no double bond is present after hydrogenation, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but no clear pathway to form the target structure.

This sequence does not successfully produce the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-Me.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after the previous steps.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, but the sequence does not explain how the formyl group or the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group is formed.

This sequence also does not align with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it includes steps that could potentially form the necessary intermediates, even though the exact transformations are unclear.

Answer: C
