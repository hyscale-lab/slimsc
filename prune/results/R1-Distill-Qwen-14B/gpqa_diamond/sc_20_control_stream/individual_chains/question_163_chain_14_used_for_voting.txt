Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem states: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this and determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. When you add an acid, it should react with the hydroxide to form a salt. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, it should donate H+ ions which will react with the OH- ions in Fe(OH)3.

First, I think I need to write the reaction equation. Fe(OH)3 is a base, and HCl is the acid. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Wait, wait, no, wait a second. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so the acid should provide three H+ ions per Fe(OH)3. So the balanced equation is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Right, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 will require 3 moles of H+ ions, which come from the strong acid. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+.

Now, let's figure out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Let's calculate:

Fe: 55.85
Each OH is 16 + 1 =17, so 3*17=51. So total molar mass is 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately. 106.85 is about 106.85. So 0.1 / 106.85 = 0.0009359 ≈ 9.359e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of H+. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 9.359e-4 ≈ 0.0028077 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M HCl (since it's a monobasic strong acid, 0.1 M). The volume needed is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 liters, which is 28.077 cm³. Hmm, so around 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly this number. Let me check the options. Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69. Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 0.1 g divided by 106.85 g/mol is indeed approximately 0.0009359 mol. Multiply by 3, that's 0.0028077 mol H+.

Volume = 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 L. That's 28.077 cm³, which is 28.08 cm³. So option C's volume is 28.05 cm³. That's very close. So perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. So if we add, say, 28 cm³ of HCl to 100 cm³, the total volume might be around 128 cm³, but the problem says 100 cm³ total. Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume after adding acid should be 100 cm³? Or is it that the solution is made up to 100 cm³ after adding the acid?

Wait, the way the problem is phrased: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." So the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid added. So when we add V cm³ of acid (concentration 0.1 M), the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So perhaps we have to calculate based on the final volume being 100 cm³.

Wait, wait, no. The way the question is worded: "the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?"

So you're adding the acid to the Fe(OH)3. The total solution volume is 100 cm³, which includes the Fe(OH)3 and the acid. So when you add V cm³ of acid, the total solution is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid added must be less than 100 cm³. Wait, but the initial volume before adding acid is the volume of Fe(OH)3 solution. Hmm, perhaps we can assume that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in some minimal volume, but the problem says total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the 100 cm³ is the final volume. So the acid volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution is 100 cm³. But I think the Fe(OH)3's volume is negligible compared to 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid added will be approximately V cm³, and the total solution is 100 cm³. So the calculation should take into account that the concentration is based on 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the approach is different. Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so perhaps it's dissolved in the acid solution. So the acid solution after adding the Fe(OH)3 will have a volume of 100 cm³.

So the moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009359 mol. Then, each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ to produce Fe^3+. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.0009359 ≈ 0.0028077 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so to get 0.0028077 mol, the volume needed is 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 L = 28.077 cm³. So that's about 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So the volume needed is approximately 28.08 cm³, so the closest is option C with 28.05 cm³.

But then, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. So after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, the solution is FeCl3, a strong acid salt. FeCl3 is a strong acid because HCl is strong, and Fe^3+ is a weak base (since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base). So the solution will be acidic.

Wait, but wait, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with excess H+ (acid), it forms Fe^3+ and water. The solution will contain Fe^3+ ions, which can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the pH depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis.

So first, compute the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The solution's final volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). Moles of Fe^3+ = moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.0009359 mol. So concentration is 0.0009359 / 0.1 = 0.009359 M.

Now, Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis in water: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The hydrolysis constant, Kb, can be found using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the Ka for the hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: the pH can be determined by considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ [Fe(H2O)3]^3+ → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of H+ ions from Fe^3+ hydrolysis can be calculated, but this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ will produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. The pH can be determined using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( (n * Kwater) / C )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, for a salt of a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKw - pKb + log C )

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a reaction where Fe^3+ acts as a weak acid, donating H+ ions. The hydrolysis equation is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But I don't remember the exact Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe I should find the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and relate it.

The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is around 6.0×10^-38 at 25°C. Wait, but Ksp is for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq). So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in our case, the solution is acidic, so OH^- is low. Alternatively, since Fe^3+ is in solution, it will hydrolyze to produce H+ ions. The hydrolysis can be described by the reaction:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction can be found from the Ksp and the ion product. Let's see, the K for the hydrolysis (let's call it K_h) can be expressed as:

K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But without knowing K_h, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the hydrolysis constant.

Alternatively, since Ksp is given, perhaps we can find the concentration of OH^- in pure water, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, since Fe(OH)3 is a very weak base, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in solution will be minimal, but in this case, since we have a strong acid, the solution will be strongly acidic. Wait, but the initial pH calculation is about after the reaction, so maybe the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, wait a minute. When we add the acid, the H+ from the acid will react with Fe(OH)3. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So in this reaction, all the Fe(OH)3 will dissolve if there's enough H+.

So after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ (if any). But in our case, we're adding the minimum amount of acid needed to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. So the moles of H+ added is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So, after the reaction, there should be no excess H+ left, because all H+ is consumed in the reaction. Therefore, the resulting solution would consist solely of Fe^3+ and water. But Fe^3+ will hydrolyze in water, producing H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

Wait, but perhaps there's another consideration. The volume of the solution is 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.0009359 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009359 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K_h, which I can relate to the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and the ion product of water.

Wait, Ksp is for Fe(OH)3 dissolving into Fe^3+ and OH^-.

So, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

In terms of K_h, which is the acid dissociation for Fe^3+ acting as an acid, we have:

K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from Ksp, [Fe^3+] = Ksp / [OH^-]^3.

Substituting into K_h:

K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / (Ksp / [OH^-]^3 )

= [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 * [OH^-]^3 / Ksp.

But [Fe(OH)3] is the concentration of the solid, which is not in solution, so perhaps I should consider the solubility equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The pH of the solution can be found by considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, so the solution is acidic. The concentration of H+ can be found using the formula for a weak acid.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009359 M. Let's denote this as C. The reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is K_h, which can be calculated from the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But the K for the hydrolysis reaction (Fe^3+ acting as an acid) is K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate K_h to Kw and Ksp.

Wait, considering the two equilibria:

1. Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-; Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

2. Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+; K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

If I multiply these two equations, I get:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- → Ksp.

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → K_h.

Multiplying these together:

Fe(OH)3(s) + Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- + Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Wait, that gets a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can find K_h as Kw^3 / Ksp.

Wait, let's see. From the first equilibrium, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

From the second, K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But [Fe(OH)3] is the solubility, which is negligible unless considering the solid. Alternatively, perhaps I can write K_h in terms of Ksp and Kw.

Let me think: since Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3, rearranged, [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+].

The second equation, K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]. But [Fe(OH)3] is the concentration of the solid, which is not in solution, so perhaps that approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak base. Since Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3, a weak base. So the pH can be found using the formula for a weak acid.

The formula for the pH of a weak acid (HA) is given by:

[H+] = sqrt( (Ka * C) )

But wait, for a salt BH+ from a weak base B, the solution is acidic because BH+ acts as an acid. The Ka for BH+ is Kw / Kb, where Kb is the base dissociation constant of B.

In our case, Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3. So Kb for Fe(OH)3 is the base dissociation constant:

Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe(OH)2^- + OH^-.

But I don't have the Kb value for Fe(OH)3. Perhaps I can find it from the Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The base dissociation (Kb) of Fe(OH)3 can be found from the reaction:

Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe(OH)2^- + OH^-

But maybe it's easier to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ as follows:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium constant for this is K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But again, without knowing K_h, perhaps I can find it using Ksp and Kw.

Let me think. The hydrolysis reaction can be written as the reverse of the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in acid. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between Ksp and the pH.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that the only H+ in solution comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is C = 0.009359 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Let me denote the change as:

Initial: [Fe^3+] = C, [H+] = x.

Change: [Fe^3+] decreases by s, [H+] increases by 3s.

Wait, no, because each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ ions. So for each mole of Fe^3+ that reacts, 3 moles of H+ are produced.

But when dealing with very weak hydrolysis, perhaps the change is small, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, using the approximation that the concentration of H+ from hydrolysis is much smaller than the initial concentration, but in this case, since the solution is made acidic by the initial H+, but wait, in our problem, after adding the exact amount of acid to dissolve Fe(OH)3, there is no excess H+. So the H+ in solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, no. Wait, the acid added was just enough to react with Fe(OH)3. So all the H+ from the acid is consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)3. Therefore, the solution after reaction contains Fe^3+ and water. The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze to produce H+.

So the H+ in solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009359 M.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Let me denote the extent of hydrolysis as 's', so:

[Fe^3+] = C - s ≈ C (if s is small).

[Fe(OH)3] = s.

[H+] = 3s.

But wait, the solution is in water, so [H+] is 3s.

The expression for K_h is:

K_h = (s) * (3s)^3 / (C - s) ≈ (s) * (27 s^3) / C = 27 s^4 / C.

But I need K_h.

Alternatively, K_h can be related to the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in the hydrolysis reaction, [Fe^3+] is C, [H+] is 3s.

Wait, perhaps I can find K_h in terms of Ksp.

Alternatively, considering that the solution is aqueous, and when Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, it produces H+ and Fe(OH)3. The solubility product for Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in terms of H+:

Since Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14 at 25°C.

So [OH^-] = Kw / [H+] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Substituting into Ksp:

Ksp = [Fe^3+] * (1e-14 / [H+])^3.

Rearranging:

[H+]^3 = [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 / Ksp.

Take cube root:

[H+] = cube_root( [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 / Ksp )^(1/3).

Wait, no, let's rearrange Ksp properly.

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

=> [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+].

=> [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3).

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH^-] = Kw / ( (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3) ) = Kw^(1) * ( [Fe^3+] / Ksp )^(1/3) )

Taking cube on both sides,

[H+]^3 = Kw^3 * [Fe^3+] / Ksp.

Wait, let me compute [H+]:

[H+] = Kw^(1) / [OH^-] = Kw / [ (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3) ) ].

Which is [H+] = Kw^(1) * ( [Fe^3+] / Ksp )^(1/3).

So [H+] = ( Kw^3 * [Fe^3+] ) / Ksp )^(1/3).

So,

[H+] = ( (1e-14)^3 * 0.009359 ) / (6e-38) )^(1/3).

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

First, compute numerator: (1e-14)^3 * 0.009359

(1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Multiply by 0.009359: 0.009359e-42 = 9.359e-45.

Denominator: Ksp = 6e-38.

So [H+]^3 = (9.359e-45) / (6e-38) ) = (9.359 / 6 ) * 1e-7 ≈ 1.5598 * 1e-7 = 1.5598e-7.

So [H+] = cube_root(1.5598e-7) ≈ (1.5598e-7)^(1/3).

Compute cube root of 1.5598e-7:

Let me compute 1e-7^(1/3) is (1e-21)^(1/3) is 1e-7? Wait, no. 1e-7 is 1e-7. So (1e-7)^(1/3) = 1e-2.333..., approximately 4.64e-3.

Wait, better to compute:

1.5598e-7 is approximately 1.5598 x 10^-7.

The cube root of 1.5598 is approximately 1.16 (because 1.16^3 ≈ 1.56).

The cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) = 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3.

So overall, [H+] ≈ 1.16 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.40e-3 M.

So [H+] ≈ 0.0054 M.

Then, pH = -log(0.0054) ≈ 2.27.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's calculate 5.4e-3.

Log(5.4e-3) = log(5.4) + log(1e-3).

Log(5.4) ≈ 0.7324.

So total log is 0.7324 -3 = -2.2676. So pH = 2.2676 ≈ 2.27.

Looking at the options, the closest pH is option C: 2.04, B: 2.69, etc.

Wait, this doesn't match any of the options exactly. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Another approach: perhaps I should consider that the solution is 0.1 L with 0.0009359 mol Fe^3+, so the concentration is 0.009359 M.

The pH can be found using the formula for a solution of a weak acid:

pH = ½ (pKw - pKa + log C )

Wait, but I don't have the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used earlier is correct, but let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the [H+] calculation.

Let me recompute [H+]:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+] = (6e-38) / (0.009359) ≈ 6.406e-36.

So [OH^-] = cube root of 6.406e-36 → approximately 1.856e-12 M.

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH^-] = (1e-14) / (1.856e-12) ≈ 5.39e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.39e-3) ≈ 2.267.

But the options don't have 2.27. The closest option is B: 2.69, C: 2.04.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Let me confirm the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. A quick search in my memory: Fe(OH)3 has a Ksp around 6.0e-38. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after the reaction, the solution is not just Fe^3+ in water, but maybe some excess HCl is left, which would make the solution more acidic. Wait, but I thought I used the minimum volume of acid, which would exactly neutralize all Fe(OH)3, leaving no excess H+.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.0009359 mol. Moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.0009359 = 0.0028077 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M HCl, so volume needed is 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 L = 28.077 cm³. So the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the 28 cm³ of HCl and the initial Fe(OH)3 solution. Since the problem states the total volume is 100 cm³, the HCl volume is 28.08 cm³. So the solution is 100 cm³.

In this solution, all the Fe(OH)3 is converted to Fe^3+ and water, and the H+ from the acid is consumed. So the solution is Fe^3+ in water, which hydrolyzes to produce H+.

So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but let's recompute the [H+] more accurately.

[H+]^3 = (Kw^3 * [Fe^3+]) / Ksp.

Kw is 1e-14.

Kw^3 = (1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

[Fe^3+] = 0.009359 M.

So numerator: 1e-42 * 0.009359 = 9.359e-45.

Denominator: Ksp = 6e-38.

So [H+]^3 = (9.359e-45) / (6e-38) ) = (9.359 /6 ) * 1e-7 → approx 1.5598 * 1e-7 = 1.5598e-7.

So [H+] = (1.5598e-7)^(1/3).

What's the cube root of 1.5598e-7?

Let me compute it more accurately.

Cube root of 1.5598e-7:

Let me compute 1.5598e-7 = 1.5598 x 10^-7.

Cube root of 1.5598 is about 1.16, as 1.16^3 ≈ 1.56.

Cube root of 1e-7 is 1e-7^(1/3) = 1e-2.333... ≈ 4.64e-3.

So 1.16 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.414e-3.

[H+] ≈ 0.005414 M.

pH = -log(0.005414) ≈ 2.267.

So pH is approximately 2.27.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B (pH 2.69) and option C (2.04). Hmm, none match 2.27. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, but the initial volume of Fe(OH)3 is not negligible. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that adding 28.08 cm³ of acid to the initial Fe(OH)3 solution might have a different volume.

Wait, but the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps that's the sum of the acid volume and the Fe(OH)3 solution's volume. But the Fe(OH)3's volume is negligible compared to 100 cm³, so the 28.08 cm³ of acid is added to reach 100 cm³.

Wait, but the initial volume of Fe(OH)3 might be around 100 cm³? No, the problem states total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid volume plus Fe(OH)3's volume equals 100 cm³. But perhaps the volume of Fe(OH)3 is negligible, so the acid volume is 28.08 cm³.

But perhaps the pH calculation is more complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't just Fe^3+ hydrolysis, but some other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is more acidic than I calculated because the initial H+ from the acid remains.

Wait, no. Because the acid is added just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So all the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction, leaving no excess H+. So the H+ comes solely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Hmm, but why isn't the pH matching any of the options?

Looking at the options:

Option C: pH 2.04, volume 28.05.

But our calculation for pH is around 2.27, which isn't exactly any option, but perhaps the options are approximations.

Wait, perhaps the Ksp I used is incorrect. Let me check: some sources say Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is around 6.0e-38, but others might have slightly different values. Let me think if this affects the calculation.

If Ksp is 6.0e-38, then [H+] would be as we calculated. But perhaps the Ksp is lower, which would increase [H+], and hence lower the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value using the exact formula.

Let me recompute [H+] using precise calculation.

Compute [H+]^3 = ( (1e-14)^3 * 0.009359 ) / 6e-38.

= ( (1e-42) * 0.009359 ) / 6e-38.

= (9.359e-45) / 6e-38.

= (9.359 / 6) * 1e-7.

= 1.5598 * 1e-7.

So [H+]^3 = 1.5598e-7 → [H+] = (1.5598e-7)^(1/3).

Let me compute that more accurately.

Using a calculator: cube root of 1.5598e-7.

Cube root of 1.5598e-7 is approximately 5.4e-3, as before.

pH = -log(5.4e-3) ≈ 2.267.

So pH is approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: pH 2.69, volume 30.09 cm³.

Option C: pH 2.04, volume 28.05 cm³.

Hmm, none exactly match. But the volume in option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close to our calculated 28.08 cm³. So perhaps the slight discrepancy is due to rounding, and the pH is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the pH is calculated using the formula for a weak acid where the hydrolysis is not negligible. Let's try another approach.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is as follows:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression for Ka is [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But without knowing Ka, perhaps we can find it from Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

From water ion product, [OH^-] = Kw / [H+].

So Ksp = [Fe^3+]*(Kw / [H+])^3.

Rearranged, [H+]^3 = [Fe^3+] * Kw^3 / Ksp.

Which is the same as before, leading to [H+] ≈ 5.4e-3, pH≈2.27.

So I'm confident in this calculation.

Looking back at the options, none have pH 2.27. The closest option is option B: pH 2.69 and option C: pH 2.04.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Let me recheck: 0.1 g Fe(OH)3, molar mass 106.85 g/mol.

0.1 / 106.85 = approx 0.0009359 mol.

Wait, but perhaps the molar mass is slightly different. Let me recalculate:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol.

Each OH is 17.007 g/mol (O:16.00, H:1.008).

So Fe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) =55.845 + 3*(17.008) =55.845 +51.024= 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 g /106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution's pH is not only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis but also from any excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but the acid added was just enough to react with Fe(OH)3, so no excess H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of the volume is different. Let me think: the question says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution." So perhaps the acid is added until all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. So I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't just Fe^3+; perhaps some of the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, but the solution is also affected by the dilution caused by adding the acid. But in our calculation, we considered the final volume as 100 cm³, so the concentration is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the dilution of the acid when adding it to 100 cm³. Let me think: when you add V cm³ of 0.1 M HCl to 100 cm³, the concentration of H+ is (0.1 * V) / (100) moles per liter.

But no, because the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved, so the H+ from the acid reacts with Fe(OH)3.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total H+ needed, but perhaps the volume calculation is considering the dilution. Hmm, no, I think the initial approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the pH is not from Fe^3+ hydrolysis but from the excess H+ from the acid. But if the acid is just enough to dissolve Fe(OH)3, then there's no excess H+.

So I'm a bit stuck because the calculated pH (≈2.27) doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution also contains H+ from the acid that wasn't consumed. Let me reevaluate that.

Wait, no. Because the acid is added in the exact amount needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, so all the H+ from the acid is consumed. So no, the solution's H+ comes solely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the problem doesn't require using the Ksp and instead uses an assumption about the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+.

Wait, if Fe^3+ is 0.009359 M, and it's a weak acid, perhaps the solution's pH can be found using the approximation for a weak acid with concentration c:

[H+] ≈ sqrt( c * Ka )

But I don't know Ka here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a strong acid, making the solution's pH based on the concentration.

But Fe^3+ is not a strong acid, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the pH is found using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ as a weak acid with a certain Ka. Let's say Ka = 1e-30 or something, but without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+ and its hydrolysis constant. But without the K_h, this is challenging.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH based on the excess H+ from the acid, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Ksp expression in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the concentration of H+ from the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in the presence of excess acid.

Wait, but in this case, the Fe(OH)3 is completely dissolved because the acid is in excess. Wait, no, because the acid is exactly the minimum needed. So the solution is just Fe^3+ and water.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. If my calculation for volume is correct, the pH should be around 2.27, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the approach. Maybe the initial assumption was wrong, and the solution is more acidic because the Fe^3+ hydrolysis produces more H+.

Wait, perhaps the [H+] is higher. Let me recompute:

[H+]^3 = ( (1e-14)^3 * 0.009359 ) / 6e-38.

= (1e-42 * 0.009359 ) / 6e-38.

= 9.359e-45 / 6e-38 = 1.5598e-7.

So [H+] = cube root(1.5598e-7) ≈ 5.4e-3 M.

pH = 2.267.

No, that's correct. So perhaps the correct pH isn't among the options, but looking at the options, option C has a volume of 28.05 cm³, which is very close to my calculated 28.08 cm³, so the correct answer should be option C, but the pH doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read again.

The problem says "the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution."

Wait, perhaps the solution's pH is not only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis but also from the acid's strength. For example, perhaps the acid is in excess, so some H+ remains. But earlier calculation shows that the acid is just enough, so no excess.

Wait, no, because the moles of H+ added (3 * 0.0009359) are exactly needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So all H+ from acid is consumed, leaving none, so the only contribution to H+ is from Fe^3+.

Thus, I think my initial calculation is correct, and perhaps the options have an error. But since the volume in option C is very close, I'll proceed with that.

So the correct answer would be option C: volume 28.05 cm³, pH 2.04? But wait, my pH calculation was 2.27, which isn't close to 2.04.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrolysis calculation. Another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base.

The pH can be found using:

pH = ½ (pKw - pKb + log C )

But I need Kb for Fe(OH)3.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But Kb for Fe(OH)3 is Ksp / [Fe^3+].

Wait, no, Kb is the base dissociation constant for Fe(OH)3 acting as a base.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base and can accept a proton to form Fe(OH)4^-.

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [Fe(OH)4^-][OH^-] / [Fe(OH)3].

But I don't know Kb. Alternatively, perhaps I can find Kb using Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

In solution, Fe(OH)3(s) is in equilibrium with Fe^3+ and OH^-.

But the base dissociation of Fe(OH)3 would be:

Fe(OH)3 + OH^- ⇌ Fe(OH)4^-.

The Kb for this reaction would be:

Kb = [Fe(OH)4^-][OH^-] / [Fe(OH)3].

But I don't have the value of Kb.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ as follows.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression for this is:

Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant and can be ignored in the expression. So,

Ka = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know Ka. However, since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, the Ka would be Kw / Kb, but without Kb, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Ksp expression to find Kb.

From Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

At pH 7, [OH^-] = 1e-7, so [Fe^3+] = Ksp / [OH^-]^3 = 6e-38 / (1e-21) )=6e-17 M. But in our case, the concentration is 0.009359 M, which is much higher.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial calculation, assuming that option C is the closest, even though the pH doesn't exactly match. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem states that Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, but the acid is added to that solution. So the total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid. So the volume of acid is less than 100 cm³.

Wait, but the volume of acid added is 28.08 cm³, so the total solution is 100 cm³. So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009359 M, as before.

Wait, perhaps the pH is calculated using a different approach. Let me try using the formula for a weak acid where:

[H+] = sqrt( (Ka * C) )

But without Ka, I can't use this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the pH as ½ (pKa + log C ), but without knowing Ka, this isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated from the concentration of H+ using the formula [H+] = sqrt( (4*Kw*C) / Ksp )^(1/2).

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C: 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But I'm not entirely confident about the pH. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem requires considering the dilution when adding the acid. Let me think.

The moles of H+ needed are 0.0028077 mol. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 L = 28.077 cm³.

If the initial volume of Fe(OH)3 solution is negligible, then adding 28.08 cm³ of acid will make the total volume approximately 100 cm³, as the problem states.

So the volume is correct, and the pH calculation must be correct.

But why doesn't the pH match any option? Maybe I should recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So perhaps the solution isn't just FeCl3, but maybe the acid is in excess, so some H+ remains. But that would require adding more than the minimum volume.

But the question asks for the minimum volume, so in that case, no H+ remains, and the pH is solely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated using the concentration of H+ from the hydrolysis, but the calculation I did gives pH ~2.27, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, pH 2.04, with the volume 28.05 cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, pH 2.69, which is closer to 2.7, but perhaps the calculation I did is off.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the [H+] more accurately.

[H+]^3 = ( (1e-14)^3 * 0.009359 ) / 6e-38.

= (1e-42 * 0.009359 ) / 6e-38.

= (9.359e-45) / 6e-38.

= 1.559833333e-7.

So [H+] = cube_root(1.559833333e-7).

Let me compute this accurately:

Cube root of 1.559833333e-7.

We can write 1.559833333e-7 as 1.559833333 x 10^-7.

The cube root of 1.559833333 is approximately 1.16 as before.

Cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^(-2.333...) ≈ 4.64e-3.

So, 1.16 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.414e-3.

So [H+] ≈ 0.005414 M.

pH = -log(0.005414) ≈ 2.267.

So, pH ≈ 2.27.

But the options are:

A) 3.16; 32.14

B) 2.69; 30.09

C) 2.04; 28.05

D) 4.94; 20.40

None of these match 2.27. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't of FeCl3 but of Fe(OH)3 in excess acid? No, because the acid is the minimum needed.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But the acid is just enough, so no excess.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer must be option C, as the volume is correct, but perhaps the pH is calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the pH is around 2.27, but it's not an option, so the intended answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid (e.g., HCl) is considered:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.869} \approx 0.0009359 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of H⁺ required
From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are required for each mole of Fe(OH)₃:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.0009359 \approx 0.0028077 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate volume of 0.1 M HCl needed
The volume of 0.1 M HCl required is:
\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.0028077}{0.1} \approx 0.028077 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the pH of the resulting solution
After the reaction, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the solution is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3}{\text{Total volume of solution}} = \frac{0.0009359}{0.1} \approx 0.009359 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the relationship between the solubility product (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃ and the pH:
\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3.
\]
For Fe(OH)₃, \(K_{sp} \approx 6.0 \times 10^{-38}\). Substituting \([\text{Fe}^{3+}]\):
\[
[\text{OH}^-]^3 = \frac{K_{sp}}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]} = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{-38}}{0.009359} \approx 6.406 \times 10^{-36}.
\]
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = (6.406 \times 10^{-36})^{1/3} \approx 1.856 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is then calculated using:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH}, \quad \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-].
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.856 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 11.73, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 11.73 \approx 2.27.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated volume of 28.08 cm³ matches closely with option C (28.05 cm³). However, the calculated pH (2.27) does not match any option exactly. The closest option for pH is C (2.04), but it is slightly lower than the calculated value. Despite this discrepancy, option C is the best match for the volume.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
