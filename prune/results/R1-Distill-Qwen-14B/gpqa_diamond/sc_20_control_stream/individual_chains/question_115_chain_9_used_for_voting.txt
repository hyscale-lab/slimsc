Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

An electron and a positron are moving towards each other along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is coming from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite in direction. But wait, the electron and positron have the same mass, right? So their rest masses are the same.

The Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for each. The electron has gamma =4, and the positron gamma=2. So I think I need to compute their relativistic momenta.

Wait, the momentum p is gamma * m * v, but more accurately, p = gamma * m * v. But since m is the rest mass, and for an electron, m is the same for both. But wait, the positron is the antiparticle of the electron, so same mass.

But velocity is a vector. The electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is, say, +v. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is -u. Wait, but when they collide, their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait: the electron is moving to the right (from left) and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are opposite.

But when calculating momentum, direction matters. So the electron's momentum is positive (right), and the positron's is negative (left), I think. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of their momenta.

Wait, but since they're annihilating, the total momentum of the system must be conserved. So the total momentum before annihilation is equal to the total after.

After annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E and direction either upper-right or lower-right. So I need to compute their momenta and find the angle between them.

But first, let me get the initial momenta right.

The momentum of each particle is p = gamma * m * beta * c. Wait, beta is v/c. But when calculating direction, the direction is important. For the electron, it's moving to the right, so positive. For the positron, moving to the left, so negative.

So let's compute the momentum of each.

Electron: gamma_e =4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c. Wait, but wait, beta is v/c. Hmm, but wait, since gamma is 4, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), I can find beta_e.

Similarly for the positron, gamma_p=2, so beta_p can be found.

Alternatively, I can find the total momentum before collision and set it equal to the total after.

Wait, but the rest mass energy of each is m_e c^2. But since the particles are annihilating, the energy will be converted into photons, but the total energy and momentum have to be conserved.

Wait, but in annihilation, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies, and the total momentum is the sum of their relativistic momenta.

So let's compute the total energy and momentum before annihilation.

Total energy before collision: E_total = gamma_e * m_e c^2 + gamma_p * m_e c^2.

Total momentum before collision: p_total = (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) - (gamma_p m_e beta_p c). Because the positron's momentum is opposite.

Wait, but wait: the positron has a charge opposite to the electron, but same mass. So when it's moving to the left, its momentum is opposite to the electron's direction.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find beta in terms of gamma.

For the electron, gamma_e =4. So gamma_e = 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e^2). Let me solve for beta_e.

1/(gamma_e²) = 1 - beta_e² → beta_e² = 1 - 1/(16), which is 15/16 → beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968.

Similarly for the positron, gamma_p =2. So gamma_p = 2 → beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)) = sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

Now, the momenta:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e c beta_e / c = gamma_e m_e beta_e. Because p = gamma m v, and v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c.

Wait, no, p_e is gamma_e m_e beta_e c.

Similarly, p_p (positron) is gamma_p m_e beta_p c but in the opposite direction. So since it's moving left, its momentum is - gamma_p m_e beta_p c.

So the total momentum before is p_e + p_p (since positron's direction is opposite, its p is negative):

p_total = (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) - (gamma_p m_e beta_p c).

Wait, but m_e, c are the same for both. So p_total = m_e c (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p).

Let's compute gamma_e beta_e: gamma_e is 4, beta_e is sqrt(15)/4. So 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15) ≈3.872.

gamma_p beta_p: 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

So p_total ≈ m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) = m_e c (2.14).

So p_total is positive, in the direction of the electron's motion.

Hmm, but wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the electron's momentum is positive, and the positron's is negative. So the total momentum is (electron's) plus (positron's), which is (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) + (- gamma_p m_e beta_p c). So yeah, p_total = m_e c (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p).

Now, after the annihilation, the two photons must carry away this momentum. Also, the total energy must be conserved.

The two photons have the same energy, E1 = E2 = E. Each photon has momentum p_photon = E/(c), since for photons, E = pc.

So the total energy after collision is E_total_after = E1 + E2 = 2E.

But the energy before collision is E_e + E_p = gamma_e m_e c² + gamma_p m_e c². So E_before = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

So 2E =6 m_e c² → E=3 m_e c². So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Wait, but wait: that can't be. For an electron-positron pair annihilating, the rest mass is 2 m_e c². So the energy from annihilation should be that. But in this case, they are moving, so their energies would be higher.

Wait, no. The rest mass of the system is 2 m_e c², but because they are moving, their total energy is higher. So, their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy is what's converted into photons.

So the calculation before holds.

So each photon has energy E=3 m_e c². So their momenta are p = E/c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c.

But wait, photons have p=E/c, so yes.

Now, the two photons' momenta must add up to the total momentum before, which is p_total = m_e c (gamma_e beta_e - gamma_p beta_p) ≈ m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) ≈ 2.14 m_e c.

So the vector sum of the two photons' momenta must equal p_total.

Each photon's momentum has a direction: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis.

Wait, but the problem says both photons are moving in the right direction, but one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their momenta are in the right direction but with some upward and downward components.

Wait, but how can their momenta add up to a net momentum in the right direction?

Hmm. Let me think. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1: direction upper-right. So its momentum vector has x-component p1x = p * cos(theta), and y-component p1y = p * sin(theta), where theta is the angle above the x-axis.

Photon 2: direction lower-right. So its x-component is p2x = p * cos(phi), and y-component p2y = -p * sin(phi), where phi is the angle below the x-axis.

But since the problem says the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are equal, so p1 = p2 = 3 m_e c.

Wait, but wait, each photon has energy E =3 m_e c². So their momentum is E/c = 3 m_e c. So each has momentum magnitude 3 m_e c.

So now, sum their momentum vectors:

Total momentum: p_total = (p1x + p2x, p1y + p2y) = (3 m_e c (cos(theta) + cos(phi)), 3 m_e c (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) )

This must equal the initial total momentum, which is (2.14 m_e c, 0). Because the initial p_total is along the x-axis.

So equations:

3 (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) = 2.14

3 (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) = 0

Hmm. Wait, 3 m_e c times these. So the equations are:

3 m_e c [ cos(theta) + cos(phi) ] = p_total_x = 2.14 m_e c

Divide both sides by m_e c: 3 ( cos(theta) + cos(phi) ) = 2.14 → cos(theta) + cos(phi) = 2.14/3 ≈0.7133.

Second equation: 3 m_e c [ sin(theta) - sin(phi) ] =0 → sin(theta) - sin(phi) =0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi).

So sin(theta) = sin(phi) → possibilities:

Either theta = phi, or theta = 180 - phi.

But since both photons are moving in the right direction (upper and lower), theta and phi are both between 0 and 90 degrees if they're above and below the x-axis. Wait, actually, upper-right could be any angle above the x-axis, but lower-right is any angle below. Wait, but in the problem statement, the directions are upper-right and lower-right, so theta is in the first quadrant and phi in the fourth. So theta and phi are each less than 90 degrees, I think.

Wait, but if theta is in the first quadrant, and phi is in the fourth, then theta is positive, phi is negative. So perhaps, phi is negative.

Wait, maybe it's better to model phi as -alpha, where alpha is the angle below the x-axis.

So, let's let theta be the angle in the upper-right direction, and phi = -alpha, where alpha is the angle below the x-axis.

So, the second equation becomes: sin(theta) - sin(-alpha) =0 → sin(theta) + sin(alpha) =0 → sin(theta) = - sin(alpha).

But theta is between 0 and 90 degrees, so sin(theta) is positive. So - sin(alpha) must be positive → sin(alpha) is negative, so alpha is between 0 and 90 degrees, but in the fourth quadrant (since phi is negative). So that makes sense.

But sin(theta) = - sin(alpha) → sin(theta) = sin(-alpha) → theta = -alpha + 2 pi n or theta = pi + alpha + 2 pi n. But since theta and alpha are between 0 and 90 degrees, the only possibility is theta = alpha. Because, for example, if theta = 30 degrees, then alpha would be 30 degrees, so phi =-30 degrees.

Wait, but wait: sin(theta) = sin(phi) → if phi is negative, then sin(phi) is negative, so sin(theta) must be negative. But theta is in the first quadrant, so its sine is positive. So the only way this works is if sin(theta) = sin(phi) =0. But that's not possible because then the angle would be 0 or 180, which doesn't fit the scenario.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the condition.

The problem states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. So their angles with the x-axis are theta and -theta, perhaps? No, because that would imply symmetry, but let's see.

Wait, let's assume that the two photons have angles theta and (180 - theta) in the opposite direction, but no, wait, that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the two photons have symmetric angles above and below the x-axis, but in the right direction. So theta and -theta.

Wait, if that's the case, then phi = -theta.

Then, equation 2: sin(theta) - sin(-theta) = sin(theta) + sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta) =0 → sin(theta)=0 → theta=0, which is not possible because then both photons would be moving along the x-axis, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Maybe the angles are not symmetric. Let's think again.

Wait, the second equation is sin(theta) - sin(phi) =0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi).

So possible solutions are:

Case 1: theta = phi + 2π n → but since theta and phi are in the same range, probably not.

Case 2: theta = π - phi + 2π n.

But considering theta and phi are in the right half-plane (upper and lower), theta is between 0 and π, phi is between 0 and π as well, but in the lower half.

Wait, perhaps phi is in the fourth quadrant, so it's between 0 and -π.

Wait, perhaps the two angles are supplementary in some way. Alternatively, perhaps phi is 180 - theta. But that would place phi in the second quadrant, which is not the case. Wait, no, because if theta is in the first quadrant, then 180 - theta is in the second quadrant, which would be to the left. But the problem states that both photons are moving to the right, so their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation as follows:

Photon 1: upper-right, angle theta from the x-axis (theta between 0 and 90 degrees).

Photon 2: lower-right, angle phi from the x-axis (phi between 270 and 360 degrees, which is the same as negative angles between -90 and 0 degrees).

So, in terms of sine and cosine:

Photon 1:

p1x = p * cos(theta)

p1y = p * sin(theta)

Photon 2:

p2x = p * cos(phi)

p2y = p * sin(phi)

But since phi is negative, say phi = -alpha, where alpha is between 0 and 90 degrees.

So p2x = p * cos(-alpha) = p cos(alpha) (since cos is even)

p2y = p * sin(-alpha) = -p sin(alpha).

So the total momentum in x-direction: p1x + p2x = p (cos(theta) + cos(alpha)).

Total momentum in y-direction: p1y + p2y = p (sin(theta) - sin(alpha)).

We know that the initial momentum is all in the x-direction, so y must sum to zero, and x must sum to 2.14 m_e c.

So,

p (sin(theta) - sin(alpha)) =0 → sin(theta) = sin(alpha).

But theta is between 0 and 90, and alpha is between 0 and 90. So sin(theta)=sin(alpha) implies that theta = alpha. Because in 0 to 90, sine is unique.

So, theta = alpha. Thus, the two angles are theta and -theta.

So now, the x-component equation becomes:

p (cos(theta) + cos(theta)) =2.14 m_e c.

p is 3 m_e c, so:

3 m_e c * 2 cos(theta) = 2.14 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = 2.14 → cos(theta)=2.14/6 ≈ 0.3567.

So theta = arccos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me check: cos(60) is 0.5, cos(69) is about 0.358, which is very close. So theta is approximately 69 degrees.

So the two photons are at +69 degrees and -69 degrees from the x-axis. So the angle between them is 69 +69 = 138 degrees.

Looking at the options: option C is 138. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

So the angles are 69 degrees above and 69 degrees below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 138 degrees.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be C) 138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, followed by the production of two photons. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the two photons.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \).
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_p = 2 \).
   - Both particles have the same rest mass \( m_e \).

2. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
     \]
     After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of two photons:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = 2E \implies E = 3 m_e c^2.
     \]
     Thus, each photon has energy \( E = 3 m_e c^2 \).

   - **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c - \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c,
     \]
     where \( \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} \) and \( \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma_e = 4 \) and \( \gamma_p = 2 \):
     \[
     \beta_e = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad \beta_p = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
     \]
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = m_e c \left( \gamma_e \beta_e - \gamma_p \beta_p \right) = m_e c \left( 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} - 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = m_e c \left( \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \right).
     \]
     Approximating \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} \approx m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) = 2.14 m_e c.
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - Each photon has energy \( E = 3 m_e c^2 \), so its momentum magnitude is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
     \]
   - The photons move in directions symmetric with respect to the x-axis: one in the upper-right direction (angle \( \theta \)) and the other in the lower-right direction (angle \( -\theta \)).

4. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum in the x-direction after annihilation is:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_1 \cos\theta + p_2 \cos(-\theta) = 3 m_e c (\cos\theta + \cos\theta) = 6 m_e c \cos\theta.
     \]
     This must equal the initial total momentum:
     \[
     6 m_e c \cos\theta = 2.14 m_e c \implies \cos\theta = \frac{2.14}{6} \approx 0.3567.
     \]
     Solving for \( \theta \):
     \[
     \theta = \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

5. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The two photons are at \( +69^\circ \) and \( -69^\circ \) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:
     \[
     \Delta\theta = 69^\circ + 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
