Okay, so I just came across this chemistry question, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that a chemist's compounds are "on top of each other." The options are about different properties. Hmm, I need to think about what this phrase implies. 

Wait, in a lab setting, when they say compounds are on top of each other, I think it's related to their physical separation or how they behave when isolated. I remember something about chromatography where if compounds have similar properties, they elute together, meaning they don't separate well. But the question here isn't about chromatography—maybe it's about another separation technique like distillation?

Distillation relies on the boiling points of substances. If two compounds have similar boiling points, they would vaporize around the same temperature, making them hard to separate. So during distillation, they might come out at the same time, hence "on top of each other." 

Looking at the options, option C says similar boiling points. That makes sense because if the boiling points are too close, they won't separate easily. 

Option A talks about similar polarities. Polarities affect solubility and interactions but directly, how does that make them "on top"? Maybe in chromatography, similar polarity would mean they move together, but the question isn't about chromatography specifically. So I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Option B mentions van der Waals interactions. That's about intermolecular forces. If the compounds are bonding through these, maybe they stick together, but the question is about their arrangement being on top. I'm not sure if this directly leads to them being on top, or if it's about separation.

Option D is about optical rotations. That's a physical property related to how they rotate plane-polarized light. If two compounds have similar optical rotations, they might not be easily distinguishable in that aspect, but I don't see how that ties into them being on top of each other during a procedure.

So, putting it together: when the chemist says the compounds are on top of each other, it's likely because they can't be easily separated, perhaps during a purification step like distillation. That would happen if their boiling points are similar. So the best answer is C.

The phrase "compounds are on top of each other" suggests difficulty in separating them, likely during a purification process. Among the options, the boiling point is a critical factor in separation techniques like distillation. If compounds have similar boiling points, they will vaporize and condense at roughly the same temperature, making it challenging to isolate them. This aligns with the idea of them being "on top of each other." Other options, such as polarity or optical rotation, do not directly explain this behavior in the context of physical separation.

Answer: C
