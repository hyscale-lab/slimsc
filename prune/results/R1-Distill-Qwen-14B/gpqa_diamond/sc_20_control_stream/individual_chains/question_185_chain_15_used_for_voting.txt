Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ are the Pauli spin matrices. I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and when you take their dot product with a vector, you get another matrix. Since n is a unit vector, its components are probably normalized, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ε.

Now, to find the eigenvalues. I remember that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant. Alternatively, if the matrix is of the form a·σ, where a is a vector, then the eigenvalues are ±|a|.

Wait, wait, that's an important point. The eigenvalues of a matrix σ · n (with n being a unit vector) would be ±1, because the magnitude of the vector is 1. Because if you think of σ·n as the dot product, the eigenvalues are the projections of spin in that direction, which are ±1 times something.

So in the given H, the coefficient is ε. So H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n.

What's the eigenvalues of σ · n? Since n is a unit vector, σ ·n is a matrix with eigenvalues ±1. So H's eigenvalues would be ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), which is ε and -ε.

Let me think again. Another approach: for a 2x2 matrix like σ · n, the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(H - λ I) =0. So for H being σ ·n multiplied by ε, let's compute the determinant.

But wait, σ ·n is a matrix, let's denote it as A. Then H = ε A. So the eigenvalues are ε times the eigenvalues of A.

What's the eigenvalues of A? Since A is a Pauli matrix in some direction. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. Because their trace is zero and determinant is -1. Wait, so the trace of A would be Tr(A) = n_x Tr(σ_x) + n_y Tr(σ_y) + n_z Tr(σ_z). But each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So Tr(A) is zero. The determinant of A: each σ_i has determinant -1, but A is a linear combination. Wait, no, the determinant of σ · n is determinant of (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Alternatively, I can think of the magnitude of the vector in the Pauli matrices' space.

Wait, another approach. The matrix σ · n is a Hermitian matrix because σ_i are Hermitian and n is real. So its eigenvalues are real. For any such matrix, the eigenvalues are ±|n|, but since n is a unit vector, |n|=1. So eigenvalues are ±1.

So H = ε (σ ·n), so eigenvalues are ε*(+1) and ε*(-1). So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. That should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes the spin matrices have eigenvalues related to ħ, like S·n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, in that case, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So S = (ħ/2) σ. So if we have H = ε σ ·n, that would be H = 2 (ε/ ħ) S ·n. So the eigenvalues would be ± (ε σ ·n) would be ± 2 (ε/ ħ) (ħ/2) )= ± ε. Wait no, that's a more complicated approach, but perhaps the original approach is correct.

Wait, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So each has eigenvalues ±1. So when you take any linear combination, like σ·n, the eigenvalues are ±1? Or is that only the case when the coefficients are such that the magnitude is 1?

Wait, the general formula is that for a matrix a·σ, where a is a vector, the eigenvalues are ±|a|. Because the magnitude of the vector a is |a|, and the eigenvalues are the magnitude times the direction. So in this case, a is a unit vector, so |a|=1, so eigenvalues ±1.

So H = ε (σ ·n), so eigenvalues are ε*(±1) = ±ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. So option B is correct.

Wait, but another perspective: sometimes the spin matrices have eigenvalues of ± ħ/2. So if the Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of spin, would that affect it? Hmm, let's see. Let's define S as the spin operator, which is (ħ/2) σ. So S = (ħ/2) σ. So H in terms of S would be H = 2 ε (S ·n) / ħ.

So the eigenvalues of S ·n are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of H would be 2 ε (± ħ/2 ) ) / ħ. Let's compute that: 2 ε ( ± ħ/2 ) / ħ = ( ε ( ± ħ ) ) / ħ ) = ± ε. Oh! So even when considering S, the eigenvalues are ±ε. So that matches my earlier conclusion.

So the correct answer is option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The task is to determine the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

The Pauli matrices \(\vec{\sigma}\) are 2x2 Hermitian matrices, and their linear combination \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) (with \(\vec{n}\) being a unit vector) forms a Hermitian matrix. A key property of such matrices is that their eigenvalues are equal to the magnitude of the vector multiplying the Pauli matrices. Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\).

The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is therefore \(\varepsilon\) times the matrix \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). This means the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), which are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

To confirm this, consider the general property that for a matrix of the form \( a \cdot \vec{\sigma} \), where \(a\) is a vector, the eigenvalues are \(\pm |a|\). Here, \(a = \varepsilon \vec{n}\), and since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(|a| = \varepsilon\). Thus, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\(+1, -1\)): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\), not just \(\pm 1\).
- **Option B** (\(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\)): Correct, as derived above.
- **Option C** (\(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\)): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues do not involve \(\hbar\).
- **Option D** (\(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\)): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\), not \(\hbar/2\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).
