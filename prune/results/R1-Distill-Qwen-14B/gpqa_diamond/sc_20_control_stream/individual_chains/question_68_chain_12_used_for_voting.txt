Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned in a particular direction, and when a magnetic field is applied, they align with it. But wait, what happens when the magnetic field changes direction suddenly?

The problem says the initial magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is mu equals gamma times Sz. Right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic moment is along +Z because the field is there.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both have the same magnitude, B. Wait, the initial field is in Z, then it's turned off, and then Y is turned on. So the system goes from being in an eigenstate of Sz to... what?

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So I think we're looking at the expectation value of Sz over time. When the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian changes too, right? Because the energy depends on the magnetic field and the magnetic moment.

Originally, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu · B_initial. Since B is along Z, H_initial would be proportional to Sz. But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu · B_final. Since B is now along Y, mu is along Y, so H_final is proportional to Sy.

Wait, but mu is given as gamma * Sz initially. Oh wait, no, mu is a vector quantity. So mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. So mu points in the same direction as the spin, which is along Z initially.

So after the field changes to Y, mu is still gamma times S, but the spin can precess around the new magnetic field direction. So the system's state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian.

Wait a second, the time evolution of the expectation value. When you change the Hamiltonian, the state doesn't immediately change, but the expectation values can oscillate because the state is a superposition of eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field change, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. The time evolution under H would be given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ), but Sy is proportional to H, so perhaps we can find the frequency from the energy levels.

Wait, the energy levels for a spin in a magnetic field are E = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, then E = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels would be ± (gamma B ħ/2) for spin up and down in Y direction.

But I'm a bit confused. Wait, spin-1/2 has eigenvalues of S_y as ± ħ/2. So the energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2), assuming the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B, and mu is gamma S. Wait, no, mu is gamma times S, so H should be H = -mu · B = -gamma S · B.

Wait, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. So the energies are E = -gamma B (s), where s is the eigenvalue of S_y. So s is ± ħ/2. So E can be either +gamma B ħ/2 or -gamma B ħ/2. Wait, no: wait, H is -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are -gamma B (s), where s is ± ħ/2. So E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- is gamma B (ħ/2). Wait no, wait: S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so when you multiply by -gamma B, the energies become E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) = ∓ (gamma B ħ/2). So E_+ would be -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- would be +gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but if the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz, but not of Sy. So the state can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |−y> states. Because after the field is turned on, the system will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian, which is based on Sy.

The initial state |+z> can be written in terms of |+y> and |−y>. How?

The |+y> state is (|+z> + |−z>)/√2, and |−y> is (|+z> − |−z>)/√2. So solving for |+z>, we have |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2.

So the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, each with coefficient 1/√2.

Now, under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution of these states will be as follows. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |−y>, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2), respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, H = -gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So H|+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>, and H|−y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |−y>.

So the time evolution of |+y> is exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, the time evolution of |−y> is exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y> = exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) |−y> = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y>.

So the initial state is (|+y> + |−y>)/√2. So the time-evolved state is:

( |+y> e^{i gamma B t /2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t /2} ) /√2.

Now, the question is about the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of the spin. So we need to compute <Sz(t)>.

Sz is the operator that has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for |+z> and |−z>, respectively. So to find <Sz(t)>, we can express the time-evolved state in terms of |+z> and |−z>, and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find how the expectation value evolves over time.

Wait, the initial state is |+z>, and at time t=0, <Sz> is ħ/2.

But after time t, the state is ψ(t) = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] /√2.

We can express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2,

|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2.

Substituting into ψ(t):

ψ(t) = [ (|+z> + |−z>)/√2 * e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> − |−z>)/√2 * e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] /√2.

Let me compute that:

Multiply numerator and denominator:

ψ(t) = [ (|+z> + |−z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> − |−z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / ( √2 * √2 )

√2 * √2 is 2, so denominator is 2.

Expanding the numerator:

[ |+z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} − |−z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2.

Group terms:

|+z> [ e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2 

+ 

|−z> [ e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2.

Wait, let me check the signs for the |−z> terms:

Wait, in the second part, it's + |−z> e^{i ...} and − |−z> e^{-i ...}, so the sum is |−z> [ e^{i ...} - e^{-i ...} ].

So:

ψ(t) = [ |+z> ( e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} ) + |−z> ( e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} ) ] / 2,

where θ = (gamma B t/2).

We can use Euler's formula: e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cos θ,

and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sin θ.

So substituting:

ψ(t) = [ |+z> (2 cos θ) + |−z> (2i sin θ) ] / 2.

Simplify:

= |+z> cos θ + i |−z> sin θ.

So the state is a combination of |+z> and |−z> with coefficients cos θ and i sin θ.

Now we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is ħ/2 for |+z> and -ħ/2 for |−z>.

So <Sz(t)> = [ <ψ(t) | Sz | ψ(t) > ].

But since |+z> and |−z> are eigenstates of Sz, the expectation value is:

cos^2 θ * (ħ/2) + (i sin θ)^* (i sin θ) * (-ħ/2 )

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

The wavefunction ψ(t) is a linear combination: a|+z> + b|−z>, with a = cos θ and b = i sin θ.

The expectation value is |a|² (ħ/2) + |b|² (-ħ/2).

Because Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and Sz|−z> = -(ħ/2)|−z>.

So |a|² is cos² θ,

|b|² is |i sin θ|² = sin² θ.

So <Sz(t)> = cos² θ*(ħ/2) + sin² θ*(-ħ/2).

Which simplifies to (ħ/2)(cos² θ - sin² θ) = (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

Because cos² θ - sin² θ is cos(2θ).

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

But θ is (gamma B t/2), so 2θ = gamma B t.

So <Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but according to the problem statement, mu is equal to gamma S_z. Wait, no, wait the initial mu is mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, mu should be along Y, so the magnetic moment is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation because the oscillation frequency is given in terms of gamma B, but maybe I missed a factor.

Wait, let me think again. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y.

The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

The time evolution for a state that is a superposition of these eigenstates would lead to oscillations in expectation values.

In the state ψ(t), the coefficients are a and b as above. The expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2)(cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ) = (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

So the oscillation occurs with frequency omega where omega is 2 gamma B.

Wait, because 2θ = gamma B t, so the cosine term has argument gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, in the expression <Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

But the problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating, and we're to find its frequency.

So the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B.

Looking at the options:

A) gamma B /2

B) gamma B

C) sqrt(2) gamma B

D) gamma B / sqrt(2)

So option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, I thought when you have the state as a superposition of two levels with energy difference delta E, the frequency is delta E / ħ.

Wait, the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ).

So the energy difference is gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Yes, that's correct. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To analyze the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, we start by considering the system's initial and final states. Initially, the particle is in the state \(|+z\rangle\), an eigenstate of \(S_z\), with the magnetic field along the \(+z\)-direction. The magnetic moment is given as \(\mu = \gamma S_z\), where \(\gamma\) is the gyromagnetic ratio.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the \(+y\)-direction, the Hamiltonian changes to \(H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y\). The eigenstates of \(S_y\) are \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\), with eigenvalues \(\pm \hbar/2\). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are \(E_+ = -\gamma B (\hbar/2)\) and \(E_- = \gamma B (\hbar/2)\).

The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) can be expressed as a superposition of \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\):
\[
|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
\]
Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:
\[
\psi(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{i\gamma B t/2} + |-y\rangle e^{-i\gamma B t/2} \right).
\]
Rewriting \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\) in terms of \(|+z\rangle\) and \(|-z\rangle\), we find:
\[
\psi(t) = \cos(\gamma B t/2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t/2)|-z\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \(S_z\) is calculated as:
\[
\langle S_z(t) \rangle = \cos^2(\gamma B t/2) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\gamma B t/2) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Using the trigonometric identity \(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta)\), this simplifies to:
\[
\langle S_z(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
\]
Thus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is \(\omega = \gamma B\).

Examining the options:
- **A)** \(\gamma B/2\): Incorrect, as the oscillation frequency is \(\gamma B\), not half of it.
- **B)** \(\gamma B\): Correct, as derived above.
- **C)** \(\sqrt{2}\gamma B\): Incorrect, as there is no factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) in the frequency.
- **D)** \(\gamma B/\sqrt{2}\): Incorrect, as the frequency is not reduced by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\).

The correct answer is **B**, as the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, which is \(\gamma B\).

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned in a particular direction, and when a magnetic field is applied, they align with it. But wait, what happens when the magnetic field changes direction suddenly?

The problem says the initial magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is mu equals gamma times Sz. Right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic moment is along +Z because the field is there.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both have the same magnitude, B. Wait, the initial field is in Z, then it's turned off, and then Y is turned on. So the system goes from being in an eigenstate of Sz to... what?

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So I think we're looking at the expectation value of Sz over time. When the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian changes too, right? Because the energy depends on the magnetic field and the magnetic moment.

Originally, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu · B_initial. Since B is along Z, H_initial would be proportional to Sz. But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu · B_final. Since B is now along Y, mu is along Y, so H_final is proportional to Sy.

Wait, but mu is given as gamma * Sz initially. Oh wait, no, mu is a vector quantity. So mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. So mu points in the same direction as the spin, which is along Z initially.

So after the field changes to Y, mu is still gamma times S, but the spin can precess around the new magnetic field direction. So the system's state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian.

Wait a second, the time evolution of the expectation value. When you change the Hamiltonian, the state doesn't immediately change, but the expectation values can oscillate because the state is a superposition of eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field change, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. The time evolution under H would be given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ), but Sy is proportional to H, so perhaps we can find the frequency from the energy levels.

Wait, the energy levels for a spin in a magnetic field are E = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, then E = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels would be ± (gamma B ħ/2) for spin up and down in Y direction.

But I'm a bit confused. Wait, spin-1/2 has eigenvalues of S_y as ± ħ/2. So the energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2), assuming the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B, and mu is gamma S. Wait, no, mu is gamma times S, so H should be H = -mu · B = -gamma S · B.

Wait, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. So the energies are E = -gamma B (s), where s is the eigenvalue of S_y. So s is ± ħ/2. So E can be either +gamma B ħ/2 or -gamma B ħ/2. Wait, no: wait, H is -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues are -gamma B (s), where s is ± ħ/2. So E_+ is -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- is gamma B (ħ/2). Wait no, wait: S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so when you multiply by -gamma B, the energies become E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) = ∓ (gamma B ħ/2). So E_+ would be -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- would be +gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, but if the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz, but not of Sy. So the state can be expressed as a combination of |+y> and |−y> states. Because after the field is turned on, the system will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian, which is based on Sy.

The initial state |+z> can be written in terms of |+y> and |−y>. How?

The |+y> state is (|+z> + |−z>)/√2, and |−y> is (|+z> − |−z>)/√2. So solving for |+z>, we have |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/√2.

So the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, each with coefficient 1/√2.

Now, under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution of these states will be as follows. The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |−y>, with energies E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2), respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, H = -gamma B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So H|+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>, and H|−y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |−y>.

So the time evolution of |+y> is exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> = exp( i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, the time evolution of |−y> is exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y> = exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) |−y> = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y>.

So the initial state is (|+y> + |−y>)/√2. So the time-evolved state is:

( |+y> e^{i gamma B t /2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t /2} ) /√2.

Now, the question is about the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of the spin. So we need to compute <Sz(t)>.

Sz is the operator that has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for |+z> and |−z>, respectively. So to find <Sz(t)>, we can express the time-evolved state in terms of |+z> and |−z>, and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find how the expectation value evolves over time.

Wait, the initial state is |+z>, and at time t=0, <Sz> is ħ/2.

But after time t, the state is ψ(t) = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] /√2.

We can express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2,

|−y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2.

Substituting into ψ(t):

ψ(t) = [ (|+z> + |−z>)/√2 * e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> − |−z>)/√2 * e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] /√2.

Let me compute that:

Multiply numerator and denominator:

ψ(t) = [ (|+z> + |−z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> − |−z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / ( √2 * √2 )

√2 * √2 is 2, so denominator is 2.

Expanding the numerator:

[ |+z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |−z> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} − |−z> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2.

Group terms:

|+z> [ e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2 

+ 

|−z> [ e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2.

Wait, let me check the signs for the |−z> terms:

Wait, in the second part, it's + |−z> e^{i ...} and − |−z> e^{-i ...}, so the sum is |−z> [ e^{i ...} - e^{-i ...} ].

So:

ψ(t) = [ |+z> ( e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} ) + |−z> ( e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} ) ] / 2,

where θ = (gamma B t/2).

We can use Euler's formula: e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cos θ,

and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sin θ.

So substituting:

ψ(t) = [ |+z> (2 cos θ) + |−z> (2i sin θ) ] / 2.

Simplify:

= |+z> cos θ + i |−z> sin θ.

So the state is a combination of |+z> and |−z> with coefficients cos θ and i sin θ.

Now we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is ħ/2 for |+z> and -ħ/2 for |−z>.

So <Sz(t)> = [ <ψ(t) | Sz | ψ(t) > ].

But since |+z> and |−z> are eigenstates of Sz, the expectation value is:

cos^2 θ * (ħ/2) + (i sin θ)^* (i sin θ) * (-ħ/2 )

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

The wavefunction ψ(t) is a linear combination: a|+z> + b|−z>, with a = cos θ and b = i sin θ.

The expectation value is |a|² (ħ/2) + |b|² (-ħ/2).

Because Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and Sz|−z> = -(ħ/2)|−z>.

So |a|² is cos² θ,

|b|² is |i sin θ|² = sin² θ.

So <Sz(t)> = cos² θ*(ħ/2) + sin² θ*(-ħ/2).

Which simplifies to (ħ/2)(cos² θ - sin² θ) = (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

Because cos² θ - sin² θ is cos(2θ).

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

But θ is (gamma B t/2), so 2θ = gamma B t.

So <Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but according to the problem statement, mu is equal to gamma S_z. Wait, no, wait the initial mu is mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, mu should be along Y, so the magnetic moment is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation because the oscillation frequency is given in terms of gamma B, but maybe I missed a factor.

Wait, let me think again. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y.

The energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2).

The time evolution for a state that is a superposition of these eigenstates would lead to oscillations in expectation values.

In the state ψ(t), the coefficients are a and b as above. The expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2)(cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ) = (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

So the oscillation occurs with frequency omega where omega is 2 gamma B.

Wait, because 2θ = gamma B t, so the cosine term has argument gamma B t. So the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, in the expression <Sz(t)> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

But the problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating, and we're to find its frequency.

So the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B.

Looking at the options:

A) gamma B /2

B) gamma B

C) sqrt(2) gamma B

D) gamma B / sqrt(2)

So option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, I thought when you have the state as a superposition of two levels with energy difference delta E, the frequency is delta E / ħ.

Wait, the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). The difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ).

So the energy difference is gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Yes, that's correct. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To analyze the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, we start by considering the system's initial and final states. Initially, the particle is in the state \(|+z\rangle\), an eigenstate of \(S_z\), with the magnetic field along the \(+z\)-direction. The magnetic moment is given as \(\mu = \gamma S_z\), where \(\gamma\) is the gyromagnetic ratio.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the \(+y\)-direction, the Hamiltonian changes to \(H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y\). The eigenstates of \(S_y\) are \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\), with eigenvalues \(\pm \hbar/2\). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are \(E_+ = -\gamma B (\hbar/2)\) and \(E_- = \gamma B (\hbar/2)\).

The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) can be expressed as a superposition of \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\):
\[
|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
\]
Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:
\[
\psi(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{i\gamma B t/2} + |-y\rangle e^{-i\gamma B t/2} \right).
\]
Rewriting \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\) in terms of \(|+z\rangle\) and \(|-z\rangle\), we find:
\[
\psi(t) = \cos(\gamma B t/2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t/2)|-z\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \(S_z\) is calculated as:
\[
\langle S_z(t) \rangle = \cos^2(\gamma B t/2) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\gamma B t/2) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Using the trigonometric identity \(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta)\), this simplifies to:
\[
\langle S_z(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
\]
Thus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is \(\omega = \gamma B\).

Examining the options:
- **A)** \(\gamma B/2\): Incorrect, as the oscillation frequency is \(\gamma B\), not half of it.
- **B)** \(\gamma B\): Correct, as derived above.
- **C)** \(\sqrt{2}\gamma B\): Incorrect, as there is no factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) in the frequency.
- **D)** \(\gamma B/\sqrt{2}\): Incorrect, as the frequency is not reduced by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\).

The correct answer is **B**, as the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, which is \(\gamma B\).

Answer: B
