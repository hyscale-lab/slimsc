Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear reactions and quantum numbers. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron, I guess) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh wait, and Pauli statistics are involved here. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted. Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to some other state plus a particle.

Wait, let me think about the terms. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So for example, 1S0 is (2*0 +1) S^0, so spin S is 0, orbital L is 0 (since S is 0 and L is denoted by the letter—S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, F is 3, etc.).

So 1S0 means S=0, L=0, J=0. Because J is the total angular momentum, so J = L + S. So yes, 0 in this case.

When they emit particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So parity is a property that matters here. The initial state has parity P_initial, and the final state must have parity P_final such that P_initial * P_X = P_final. Wait, or is it the other way around? Parity is multiplicative. So the parity of the initial state is the product of the parity of the final state and the parity of the emitted particle.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. What's the parity of a 1S0 state? For a two-body system (like deuteron), the parity is (-1)^L. Because for two particles, each with spin but parity is determined by orbital angular momentum. Oh right, because parity operator P acting on orbital part gives (-1)^L, and for spin part, since the deuteron is a spin-0, so S=0, which doesn't contribute to parity. So parity of 1S0 is (-1)^0 = +1.

So P_initial = +1. The emitted particle X has parity -1. So the final state after emission is the NN system plus X. So the parity of the final state is P_final = P_initial * P_X * (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum in the system. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, when a particle is emitted, the total parity is the product of the initial parity, the parity of the emitted particle, and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle's state. Because when a particle is emitted, it's in some angular momentum state, and that contributes to the parity.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the parity conservation. The initial parity is P_initial, and the final parity is P_final = P_initial * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the emitted particle. Because when you emit a particle, the parity changes by the parity of the particle and the orbital angular momentum involved. Oh wait, no, the parity of the final state would be the product of the initial parity, the particle's parity, and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle's state.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a reaction like NN → NN + X, the overall parity must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state (1S0) is equal to the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X, multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum in the emission process.

So, the equation would be:

P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L.

Here, P_initial is the parity of the initial state, which is 1S0, so P_initial is +1.

P_X is given as -1 for the emitted particle X.

So: 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L.

Simplify that: 1 = P_final * (-1)^{L+1}.

So P_final = (-1)^{L+1}.

But P_final is the parity of the NN system after emission. Let's see, the final state of the NN system is given as something like 3S1, etc. For each of these, their parity is (-1)^L. Because for each of the options, the NN state has a certain L. So for each option, the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L. So P_final = (-1)^L_final, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN state in the option.

Wait, no. Because the final state is the NN plus X, but the parity of the NN system is the same as it's a bound system. No, wait, the NN system is the same as the initial, but wait, actually no: the NN system is part of the final state (along with X). So the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum associated with X's emission.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the parity conservation. The initial parity is P_initial = 1 (since 1S0). After emission, the final parity is P_final = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L. So,

1 = P_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L.

Simplify: 1 = P_NN * (-1)^{L+1}.

So P_NN = (-1)^{L+1}.

But P_NN is the parity of the final NN state, which is (-1)^L_NN. So,

P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN}.

Set equal to (-1)^{L+1}:

(-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{L+1}.

Which implies that L_NN ≡ L +1 mod 2.

So, L_NN = L +1 mod 2.

So, L_NN is L+1 (mod 2). That is, if L is even, L_NN is odd, and if L is odd, L_NN is even.

But wait, what is L here? L is the angular momentum state of the emitted particle X. Wait, no. Let me think again. The L in the equation is the orbital angular momentum in the emission process, which refers to the orbital angular momentum of the X particle in the decay. So, in the emission process, the X is emitted with some orbital angular momentum state l (lowercase), which is given in the options as the last letter (e.g., p, s, etc.)

So the L in the equation is the orbital angular momentum of the X, which is l. So, l is the lower case letter. So, from the options:

A) 7D1 + p → l= p → which is l=1? Wait, no, letters correspond to l: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3.

Wait, in the options, the letters after the plus sign are the particle's orbital angular momentum? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the options are like 1S0 → 7D1 + p. Oh, the p could denote the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. So p would be l=1.

So, to recap:

We have for each option, the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. So L in the equation is l.

So, the equation is P_NN = (-1)^{l+1}.

But P_NN is the parity of the final NN state, which is (-1)^L_NN, where L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

So,

(-1)^L_NN = (-1)^{l +1}.

Taking log (so to speak), exponents must be congruent modulo 2.

So,

L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2.

Which means L_NN = l +1 mod 2.

So, for each option, I can compute L_NN and see if it's compatible with the given NN state.

Additionally, the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Given that T(NN) is 0, so 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

So,

S(NN) + L(NN) ≡ 1 mod 2.

Which implies that S(NN) and L(NN) must have opposite parity. Because S + L must be odd.

So, let's go through the options.

Each option gives the initial state (1S0) and the final state (like 7D1) plus a particle with orbital angular momentum l (like p, which is l=1). 

Wait, but the first part of the option (like 7D1) is the final state of the NN system, right? So 7D1 would have L=2 (since D is 2), and S is 3 (since 7 is (2S+1) → 2S+1=7 → S=3). So for each option, the final NN state is (2S+1)L(J), so we can extract S and L from each option.

Wait, for example, option A: 7D1. So (2S+1) =7 → S=3. The L is D, which is 2. So S=3, L=2.

Similarly, option B: 3S1. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S → 0.

Wait, wait, no. Because in spectroscopic notation, the L is denoted by the letter. So S is spin, L is orbital. So for 3S1: 3 is (2S+1), so S=1. Then the next letter is S, so L=0. J is 1.

So for each option, the final NN state has certain S and L. Let's tabulate them.

Option A: 7D1 → S=3, L=2.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1, L=0.

Option C: 3D3 → S=1, L=2.

Option D: 3P0 → S=1, L=1.

Wait, let's make a table:

Option | Final State | S | L | X's l
---|---|---|---|---
A |7D1|3|2|p (1)
B |3S1|1|0|p (1)
C |3D3|1|2|f (3)
D |3P0|1|1|s (0)

So for each option, we can check:

1. The parity condition: L_NN = L must satisfy L ≡ l +1 mod 2.
2. The Pauli condition: S + L must be 1 mod 2.

Wait, let's compute for each option.

Option A:

S=3, L=2.

X's l =1.

Parity condition: L (2) ≡ l (1) +1 → 2 ≡ 2 mod 2 → 0 ≡0 → yes, condition holds.

Pauli condition: S + L =3 +2=5 → 5 mod 2=1. So 1≡1 → condition holds.

So both conditions satisfied. So option A is allowed.

Option B:

S=1, L=0.

l=1.

Parity condition: L (0) ≡ l (1)+1 → 0 ≡ 2 mod 2 → 0≡0 → ok.

Pauli condition: S + L=1+0=1 → 1 mod 2=1 → condition holds.

So allowed.

Option C:

S=1, L=2.

l=3 (f).

Parity condition: L=2 ≡ l (3) +1 → 2 ≡4 mod 2 → 0≡0 → ok.

Pauli condition: S + L=1+2=3 → 1 mod 2 → condition holds.

So allowed.

Option D:

S=1, L=1.

l=0 (s).

Parity condition: L=1 ≡ l (0) +1 → 1 ≡1 → yes.

Pauli condition: S + L=1+1=2 → 0 mod 2 → which doesn't equal 1. So condition not satisfied.

Wait, what's the condition again? The Pauli condition is S + L +1 mod 2 equals T, which is 0.

Wait, the equation given is T = S + L +1 mod2.

So 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

So in option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. So 0 ≡ T (0) → 0=0, which would be correct? Wait, no, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

So if T=0,

0 ≡ S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

In option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. So 0≡1? No, that's not possible. So condition is violated.

Wait, my mistake earlier: the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

So T is 0, so:

0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

So for each option, S + L must be 1 mod2.

Option A: S=3 (3 mod2=1), L=2 (0 mod2). 1+0=1 → yes.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → yes.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 1+0=1 → yes.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=0 → no. So condition not met.

So the partial wave that's not permitted is option D.

Wait, but wait: the options are which partial wave is not permitted. So the one where either the parity condition or the Pauli condition is violated.

So option D violates the Pauli condition, so it's not permitted.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions and each option systematically:

### Key Information:
1. **Initial State**: The system is in a 1S0 state, which has \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of this state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = +1 \).
2. **Emission of Particle X**: The emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( P_X = -1 \). The parity conservation condition is:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^L,
   \]
   where \( L \) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \( X \). Simplifying:
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{final}} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^L \implies P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L+1}.
   \]
3. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: The isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy:
   \[
   T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Given \( T(NN) = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
