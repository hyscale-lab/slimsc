Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration given is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A through D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us how strong that complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So, in this case, Ca-EDTA is a stable complex because K is 5e10, which is pretty large.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, I'm thinking about what that means. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, right? Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and it usually forms complexes with a 1:1 ratio with metal ions like Ca^2+.

So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that's the concentration of [CaEDTA]^2- in solution. Now, the question is, what is the concentration of free calcium ions? Because the complex dissociates a bit, so some Ca^2+ ions are released into the solution.

The formation constant, K, is given by the equation K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, when the complex is already present, perhaps we can think of the reverse reaction. So, the dissociation of the complex would be [CaEDTA]^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. The formation constant is Kf, which is the same as the K for the formation of the complex.

So, the dissociation constant, Kd, would be 1/Kf. Because Kd is the inverse of Kf. So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but in solution, the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and free EDTA are involved. But in this problem, the solution contains the complex, so I'm assuming that the EDTA is in excess, so that [EDTA] is approximately constant. Or maybe it's a 1:1 complex, so when the complex dissociates, [Ca] and [EDTA] are equal.

Alternatively, the problem might be simplified by assuming that the concentration of free EDTA is much higher than the concentration of free Ca^2+, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. Let's think about this.

Wait, the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's consider the dissociation:

[CaEDTA]^2- → Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

Let me denote the concentration of free Ca^2+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA would also be x, assuming that each dissociation of the complex releases one Ca and one EDTA. But wait, initially, the complex is 0.02 M, and if it dissociates by x, then [CaEDTA]^2- would be 0.02 - x. But since Kd is very small (2e-11), x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA] / [CaEDTA] ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So, x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13.

So, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Hmm, because sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5 (since 1e-13 is 1e-12 * 0.1, so square root is 1e-6 * sqrt(0.1) ≈ 3.16e-7). So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the concentration of Ca^2+.

Wait, let me double-check the math. Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So, Kd = (x^2)/0.02 = 2e-11. So x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = (2)* (1e-6.5) = 2e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7.

Yes, that matches option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}}.
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) be \( x \). Since the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), both \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) are approximately \( x \). The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}\) is initially 0.02 M, and since \( K_d \) is very small, the dissociation is minimal, so \([\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-} \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \times 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Approximating \( 10^{-6.5} \) as \( 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

So, x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13.

So, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Hmm, because sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5 (since 1e-13 is 1e-12 * 0.1, so square root is 1e-6 * sqrt(0.1) ≈ 3.16e-7). So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the concentration of Ca^2+.

Wait, let me double-check the math. Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So, Kd = (x^2)/0.02 = 2e-11. So x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = (2)* (1e-6.5) = 2e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7.

Yes, that matches option C.

The formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), so:

\[

\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}]^{2-}}.
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) be \( x \). Since the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), both \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) are approximately \( x \).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \times 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Approximating \( 10^{-6.5} \) as \( 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
