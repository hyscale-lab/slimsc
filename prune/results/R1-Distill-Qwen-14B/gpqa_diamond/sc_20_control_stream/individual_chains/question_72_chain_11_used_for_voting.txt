Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see... The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, this might take a while, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a norbornene structure with a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound, right? So it has that bridge structure.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh, wait, I remember that when you have something with dibromomethyl groups and you use sodium iodide, it's probably an example of the Finkelstein reaction. The Finkelstein is where you exchange halides, typically bromides or iodides. So the dibromomethyl groups would undergo substitution.

Wait, but wait a second. The starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the methyl groups attached to carbons 5 and 6 has two bromine atoms. So each methyl is Br2C-. When Finkelstein happens, iodide would substitute the bromide. But wait, sodium iodide in a polar aprotic solvent? Or maybe it's in a solution with something else. Oh, wait, the reaction conditions just say elevated temperature, so maybe it's a SN2 kind of reaction.

Wait, but each methyl group has two bromines. So each Br is on a methyl, which is attached to the cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring. So the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two methyl groups at positions 5 and 6, each bearing two Brs.

So when 2 equivalents are used, perhaps each Br is replaced by iodide. So each methyl group would have two iodides instead? Or maybe each methyl only has one Br, but each has two Brs, so each would lose both Brs. Hmm, but wait, sodium iodide is a source of I-.

Wait, perhaps each dibromomethyl group (CBr2) reacts twice. So each CBr2 becomes CI2. So the product would have two CI2 groups attached to the cyclohexadiene. Or wait, maybe the cyclohexadiene is undergoing some kind of coupling with the norbornene?

Wait, maybe another approach. The starting compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a norbornene derivative. When norbornene derivatives react, especially with dienes, sometimes they undergo Diels-Alder reactions. But wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Hmm, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, which is a good diene for Diels-Alder.

Wait, but the norbornene is a dienophile? Or maybe it's acting as a diene? Hmm.

Wait, norbornene has two double bonds? Or no, it's a bicyclo structure with one double bond. Wait, no, the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So it's a bicyclic compound with a double bond at position 2. So when combined with another diene, perhaps a [4+2] cycloaddition occurs.

Alternatively, the presence of two equivalents suggests that maybe each of the two bromines on each methyl is being replaced by something.

Wait, but the problem mentions that it's combined with 2 equivalents of that diene and sodium iodide. So perhaps the norbornene is acting as a dienophile, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the diene. So the Diels-Alder reaction would form a new six-membered ring, adding the two components together.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has substituents at 5 and 6 positions. Let me visualize that. So the diene is cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and the substituents are at positions 5 and 6. So that would be across from each other on the ring.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would attack the dienophile (norbornene). The reaction would form a bicyclic structure, perhaps fusing the rings.

But wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the two methyl groups at 5 and 6 has two Brs. So during the Diels-Alder reaction, these substituents would end up in specific positions in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is reacting with two equivalents of norbornene. Wait, no, the norbornene is the starting material, and the other reagent is the diene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So norbornene with an O-t-Bu group. Then it's reacted with 2 equivalents of this cyclohexadiene, which has two dibromomethyl groups.

But wait, the reaction is in presence of sodium iodide. So maybe it's a coupling reaction where the diene is being brominated or something. Or perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution.

Wait, another approach: the sodium iodide in a polar aprotic solvent would cause the Finkelstein reaction. So each CBr2 would substitute both bromides with iodides. So the diene becomes 5,6-bis(diodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

But how does that react with the norbornene?

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder happens first. So the norbornene (dienophile) reacts with the diene (cyclohexadiene) to form a new bicyclic compound. Then, in the presence of sodium iodide, the CBr2 groups are converted to CI2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sequence. Let's think. When you have a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene and dienophile combine to form a six-membered ring with two substituents from each reactant.

In this case, the diene is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and the dienophile is the norbornene.

So the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure where each of the methyl groups (with Br2) are added to the new structure.

Wait, but maybe the product after Diels-Alder is a bridge structure, incorporating the norbornene and the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, perhaps the product after the first reaction is a Diels-Alder adduct, where the norbornene has added the diene. So the product would have the bicyclo structure with the substituents from the diene, which are the two CBr2 groups.

But wait, wait a moment. How many equivalents are used? The question says 2 equivalents of the diene. So perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions happen, or maybe each equivalent adds once, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each diene molecule adds once to the norbornene, but since we have 2 equivalents, maybe two norbornene molecules are reacting with one diene each.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider the overall structure of the product after each step.

Let me try to outline each step:

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, elevated temperature.

Assuming Diels-Alder, each diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would react with a dienophile (norbornene) to form a bicyclic structure. But since there are 2 equivalents of diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding a diene to the norbornene. Or maybe the diene is the dienophile and norbornene is the diene? Wait, no, because norbornene is a strained dienophile, more likely to react as the dienophile.

Wait, but norbornene has a double bond, so as a dienophile, it would react with the diene.

So each diene molecule would add a norbornene unit. Wait, no, each diene would add one dienophile (norbornene) molecule. So with 2 equivalents of diene, two norbornene molecules would add? Or perhaps each diene can react with two dienophiles?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the structure after the first reaction.

After the reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Sulfuric acid is often used for acid-catalyzed reactions, like ring-opening of epoxides or elimination reactions.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which sounds like a sulfonation or possibly a sulfonamide formation, but more likely a sulfonation of an aromatic ring. Alternatively, SO3 is used for sulfonation, usually in presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. Wait, but in DMSO with pyridineâ€”that might be a Mitsunobu reaction or some kind of substitution, but more likely, it's a sulfonation.

Wait, but product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. Hmm, DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, and pyridine could be a base. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So perhaps product 2 has an aromatic ring that's being sulfonated.

Finally, product 3 is heated at 150C to form product 4. Heating often leads to elimination or rearrangement. So perhaps a sulfonated group is lost, or an elimination occurs.

But maybe I should try to figure out each step and see what structures are formed.

Let me start over. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a norbornene derivative, with a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

When this compound is reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps the diene is undergoing substitution reactions. Wait, but NaI is more about exchanging halides. So the dibromomethyl groups would become diiodomethyl groups.

But how does that tie into the norbornene?

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is opening up. Wait, norbornene can undergo ring-opening reactions, such as in Diels-Alder reactions. If the norbornene is the dienophile, then the diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would attack it.

Wait, but the diene in this case is substituted with two dibromomethyl groups. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the substituents would end up in specific positions on the new ring.

So each Diels-Alder would add a diene (with substituents) to the dienophile (norbornene). But since there are two dienes used, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts are formed?

Wait, perhaps each diene adds once to the norbornene, leading to two substituents on the product. Alternatively, the diene could be adding across the norbornene, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: the norbornene molecule has two double bonds? No, wait, the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which has two double bonds? No, wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which has one double bond.

Wait, so the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, meaning there are two double bonds: one at position 2 and another at position 5? So it's a conjugated diene within the norbornene structure. Hmm, that's possible. So it's a bicyclic compound with two conjugated double bonds.

Wait, but the question states 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a bicyclo structure with double bonds at 2 and 5, making it a conjugated diene.

So that would make it more reactive as a dienophile. So when it reacts with another diene, it can undergo Diels-Alder.

Wait, but the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a diene with substituents. So perhaps the norbornene (acting as a dienophile) would react with each diene molecule.

Given that two equivalents of the diene are used, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding a diene to the starting norbornene.

Wait, but norbornene only has one dienophile site. So perhaps each diene adds once, leading to a more complex structure. Or maybe the product is a tricyclic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with the diene in a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's less common. More likely, it's a Diels-Alder.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is the dienophile and norbornene is the diene. Wait, norbornene is a strained dienophile, so more likely to react as such. But if it's a conjugated diene itself, maybe it can act as a diene.

Wait, maybe the norbornene's double bonds are in such a way that it can act as a diene. So perhaps the diene is the cyclohexadiene, and the norbornene is the dienophile.

So the Diels-Alder would form a new six-membered ring, connecting the diene and dienophile.

But I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should look up the structure.

Wait, norbornene has the bridge structure, with one double bond. So if the diene is another molecule, perhaps the Diels-Alder would form a new ring.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder but a cyclopropanation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product after the first step is treated with aqueous H2SO4. If the first step forms an epoxide, then H2SO4 might open it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction forms a diiodomethyl-substituted compound. Because the Finkelstein would convert Br to I. So the diene becomes 5,6-bis(diodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

But how does that react with the norbornene? Maybe the iodides are leaving groups, leading to some elimination or substitution.

Wait, maybe the norbornene is undergoing a ring-opening metathesis or some addition. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution with the tert-butoxy group.

Wait, no, sodium iodide and elevated temperature are more about Finkelstein. So the Br in the diene becomes I. So each diene's methyl groups have two I now.

But how does that tie into the norbornene? Perhaps the diene, after substitution, is then undergoing another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is adding across the norbornene's double bonds.

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder is happening, adding the diene to norbornene, and each diene has two diiodomethyl substituents. So the product 1 would be a Diels-Alder adduct with two diiodomethyl groups attached.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to think about the later steps.

Step 2: product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. So H2SO4 in water. Maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening or elimination.

Step 3: product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. That sounds like a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, and pyridine might act as a base to deprotonate during the reaction. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent.

So product 2 must have something that can be sulfonated, like an aromatic ring or a double bond that can undergo electrophilic addition.

Step 4: product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. Heating can cause elimination (like losing a leaving group) or rearrangement.

Putting it all together, perhaps the final product has several substituents, and I need to count the distinct hydrogens.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a Diels-Alder, adding the diene to the norbornene, incorporating the diiodomethyl groups. Then, when treated with H2SO4, perhaps the diiodomethyl groups undergo some acid-catalyzed reaction, like substitution or elimination.

Wait, but diiodomethyl groups are quite bulky. Alternatively, perhaps the iodides are leaving groups. In acidic conditions, perhaps they hydrolyze or undergo elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Diels-Alder adds the diene to the norbornene, giving a bridged structure with the diiodomethyl groups attached. Then, treating with H2SO4 could protonate and cause elimination, forming a new double bond or ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe the diiodomethyl groups undergo substitution with water in acidic conditions, but that would require a good leaving group. I- is a better leaving group than Br, but in acidic conditions, perhaps substitution occurs.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct with diiodomethyl groups. Then, when treated with H2SO4, which is a strong acid, it could cause the diiodomethyl groups to undergo substitution, especially in an SN2 reaction. Since each has two I's, perhaps two substitutions occur, replacing I with something else, like H.

Wait, but what's the other possibility. Maybe the diiodomethyl groups lose HI in acidic conditions, leading to the formation of a double bond. So each diiodomethyl (CH2I2) could lose two HI molecules to become CH2.

Wait, but CH2 is not stable. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2I2 loses HI and becomes a double bond, but that would require dehalogenation.

Wait, but in acidic conditions, maybe each CH2I2 group loses two I- as leaving groups, forming a double bond. So CH2I2 â†’ CH2 (which is not possible, so maybe it becomes a diene). Wait, perhaps each diiodomethyl group loses two I's and forms a double bond adjacent to the existing structure.

Wait, but each diiodomethyl group has two I's, so losing both would require two departures. Maybe each CH2I2 becomes CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diiodomethyl groups are cleaved via elimination, releasing HI and forming a new double bond. So, each CH2I2 would become CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2I2 becomes a double bond, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the acid treatment isn't about the diiodomethyl groups but about the ring structure. If product 1 is a bicyclic structure, perhaps the acid causes it to open, forming a more complex structure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible product structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder is not happening, and the Finkelstein is the main reaction. So the diene's dibromomethyl groups are converted to diiodomethyl groups. Then, perhaps the next step involves some interaction between the diiodomethyl groups and the norbornene.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the norbornene is acting as a Lewis acid, coordinating to the I- in the diiodomethyl groups. Then, an elimination occurs, perhaps forming a new ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the diiodomethyl groups are undergoing some kind of substitution with the tert-butoxy group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene has a lone pair or some structure that allows the diiodomethyl groups to attack. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing a radical substitution, but that's probably not the case here.

Another thought: the norbornene has a bridgehead position (position 7) with a tert-butoxy group. Perhaps the diene, after substitution, is incorporating into the norbornene's structure through some addition.

But I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should look at the possible options for the number of distinct hydrogens.

The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. If the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule, it would have fewer distinct hydrogens. Alternatively, if it's a complex bridged structure with many substituents, it could have more.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane or something with high symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about each step again.

Step 1: Reaction between 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, NaI, elevated temp.

Assuming Finkelstein, the diene becomes 5,6-bis(diodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Then, maybe the diene adds to the norbornene via Diels-Alder, leading to a bridged structure with two diiodomethyl groups attached.

Step 2: Treat with aqueous H2SO4. Acid might cause elimination, forming additional double bonds or rings. Or perhaps the diiodomethyl groups undergo substitution, losing I- and forming something else.

Wait, diiodomethyl groups in acidic conditions could undergo substitution with water. So each CH2I2 would become CH2OH after substitution. But wait, substitution with two equivalents of water would require both I's to be replaced, so each CH2I2 would become CH2(OH)2.

But in aqueous H2SO4, perhaps the conditions are such that the diiodomethyl groups are converted to diol groups.

So product 2 would have two -CH2(OH)2 groups attached.

Step 3: Treat with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So any acidic protons, like on the diol groups, could be replaced by a sulfonic acid group. Or perhaps the diol is converted to a sulfonate ester.

Wait, but diols can be sulfonated, especially if they're in a position that allows for good leaving group formation. Alternatively, the diol might form a cyclic sulfonate.

Wait, another approach: Treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO is a classic sulfonation method. If product 2 has a diol group, then the hydroxyl groups could be converted to sulfonate groups. For example, each OH could be replaced by SO3H.

So product 3 would have two sulfonic acid groups attached where the diiodomethyl groups were.

Step 4: Heating product 3 at 150Â°C. Heating could cause the sulfonic acid groups to decompose or eliminate. Alternatively, the sulfonic acid groups might lose SO3 to form new structures.

Wait, but sulfonic acid groups are generally stable under heat. Unless elimination is possible.

Wait, another possibility: if the sulfonic acid groups are in a position that allows for elimination, maybe they form double bonds upon heating.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is a good leaving group. So when heated, it could leave, causing ring expansion or contraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is eliminated as SO2 and H2O, leaving behind a double bond.

Wait, but that's not a typical reaction. Sulfonic acids usually don't eliminate under thermal conditions. Alternatively, if the sulfonate group is ortho to another group, elimination could form a double bond.

Hmm.

But maybe I should think about the final structure. If the starting material is norbornene, and after Diels-Alder and other reactions, the final product could be a cubane-like structure, which is highly symmetrical, having fewer distinct hydrogens.

Wait, cubane has eight equivalent hydrogen atoms, each in a corner. So that would match option A)8.

Wait, but how would that happen?

If product 4 is cubane, then it would have eight equivalent hydrogens. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with multiple substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct hydrogens.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the overall process.

The first step adds two diiodomethyl groups via Diels-Alder, leading to a bicyclic structure with two CH2I2 substituents.

Second step: treatment with H2SO4 converts the CH2I2 groups to CH2(OH)2. 

Third step: sulfonation converts the OH groups to OSO3H.

Fourth step: heating at 150Â°C. If OSO3H groups are present, perhaps they are eliminated. For example, each sulfonate group could lose SO3 as a leaving group, forming a double bond. So each OSO3H group would leave, and the adjacent carbons would form a double bond.

If each substituent has a sulfonate group, their elimination would form two new double bonds, perhaps leading to a structure like cubane.

Wait, but cubane is a cube structure, which is highly symmetrical. Each corner would have a hydrogen, making eight distinct H's. Wait, but in cubane, all H's are equivalent, so only one type. But the question is about chemically distinct H's.

Wait, no, in cubane, each H is in a different position, but due to the symmetry, they might be equivalent. Wait, cubane has four equivalent pairs of H's. Or maybe all eight H's are equivalent. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think: cubane is a cube, with each corner having a CH group. Each CH is connected to three others. Due to the cube's symmetry, each H is in a position that's equivalent under rotation. So all eight H's are equivalent. So the number of chemically distinct H's would be 1.

But the options include 8, 4, 10, 7. So that doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure. Maybe the elimination forms a bridge, leading to a bicyclic structure with multiple substituents, each with different environments, leading to more distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is adamantane, which has more symmetry. Adamantane has 12 equivalent H's if I recall correctly, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the Diels-Alder adds two diene units to the norbornene, leading to a structure like a norbornene fused with two cyclohexene rings. Then, after substitution and sulfonation, elimination leads to a structure with multiple rings and substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct H's.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about each step's possible outcome.

Step 1: Diels-Alder adds two diene units to the norbornene, each bringing a diiodomethyl group. So product 1 is a tricyclic compound with two diiodomethyl groups attached.

Step 2: Acid treatment converts diiodomethyl groups to diol groups.

Step 3: Sulfonation converts diols to sulfonate groups.

Step 4: Heating eliminates the sulfonate groups, forming a new structure. Perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, leading to a more strained and rigid structure.

Alternatively, the elimination could form a bridged structure, leading to a compound with multiple rings.

Wait, if two sulfonate groups are eliminated, each elimination could form a double bond. So the final product would have two new double bonds where the sulfonate groups were.

But the starting material already has some double bonds. It's getting tricky.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornadiene derivative with additional substituents.

Alternatively, since each step adds more complexity, the final product might have several distinct hydrogen environments.

But without a clear structural path, it's hard to count the H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane, which has eight equivalent H's, but that would be one type, not eight distinct. So that can't be. So perhaps the final product is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclo structure with several substituents, leading to multiple distinct H's.

Wait, let's think about the options. The options are 8, 4, 10, 7.

If each sulfonate group is eliminated, forming a double bond, perhaps the structure becomes more rigid, and the H's around the rings become distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a bridged structure with several substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct H's.

Wait, another approach: maybe the final product is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, each leading to distinct H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has four distinct H's. That would be option B)4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the heating in step 4 causes the sulfonate groups to undergo some kind of rearrangement, leading to a structure where all H's are equivalent except for a few.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a highly symmetric molecule with only four distinct H's.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, and the fact that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the possible number of H's.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. The Diels-Alder adds two dienes, each bringing diiodomethyl groups. Then, after substitution and sulfonation, and elimination, perhaps the final product is a molecule with four distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps each step leads to a more complex structure, but the final product has 8 distinct H's.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Since I'm stuck, maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the first step: 2 equivalents of diene. Each diene contributes two substituents. So maybe in product 1, there are two diiodomethyl groups attached symmetrically.

Then, after acid treatment, they become diols. Then, sulfonated to di-sulfonates. Heating eliminates them, perhaps forming two double bonds.

If the elimination forms a structure with two new double bonds, perhaps it's a more conjugated system, leading to a structure with several rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a cubane-like structure, but with substituents.

Wait, but without knowing, I think the most plausible answer is 8, which would correspond to option A. But I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a sequence of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which undergoes multiple transformations to yield a final product. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI**  
   - The starting material is a norbornene derivative with a tert-butoxy group.  
   - The diene (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene) reacts with the norbornene.  
   - Sodium iodide likely facilitates a Finkelstein reaction, converting the dibromomethyl groups to diiodomethyl groups.  
   - A Diels-Alder reaction is plausible, where the norbornene acts as a dienophile, and the diene forms a bicyclic adduct with two diiodomethyl substituents.

2. **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„**  
   - Acidic conditions may lead to substitution or elimination reactions involving the diiodomethyl groups.  
   - The diiodomethyl groups likely convert to diol groups (-CHâ‚‚OHâ‚‚), forming a product with hydroxyl substituents.

3. **Step 3: Reaction with SOâ‚ƒ and pyridine in DMSO**  
   - Sulfonation occurs, converting the diol groups into sulfonate groups (-SOâ‚ƒH).  
   - The product now contains sulfonate groups at the positions where the diiodomethyl groups were originally located.

4. **Step 4: Heating at 150Â°C**  
   - Heating likely causes elimination of the sulfonate groups, forming new double bonds or altering the ring structure.  
   - The final product may be a rigid, highly symmetrical structure, potentially resembling cubane or a similar polycyclic compound.

### Symmetry and Hydrogen Count:
- If the final product is cubane-like, all eight hydrogens are equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in only one type of hydrogen.  
- However, the options provided (A: 8, B: 4, C: 10, D: 7) suggest a different outcome.  
- Considering the transformations, the final product likely has a structure with multiple distinct hydrogen environments.  
- Based on the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see... The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, this might take a while, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a norbornene structure with a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound, right? So it has that bridge structure.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh, wait, I remember that when you have something with dibromomethyl groups and you use sodium iodide, it's probably an example of the Finkelstein reaction. The Finkelstein is where you exchange halides, typically bromides or iodides. So the dibromomethyl groups would undergo substitution.

Wait, but wait a second. The starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the methyl groups attached to carbons 5 and 6 has two bromine atoms. So each methyl is Br2C-. When Finkelstein happens, iodide would substitute the bromide. But wait, sodium iodide in a polar aprotic solvent? Or maybe it's in a solution with something else. Oh, wait, the reaction conditions just say elevated temperature, so maybe it's a SN2 kind of reaction.

Wait, but each methyl group has two bromines. So each Br is on a methyl, which is attached to the cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring. So the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two methyl groups at positions 5 and 6, each bearing two Brs.

So when 2 equivalents are used, perhaps each Br is replaced by iodide. So each methyl group would have two iodides instead? Or maybe each methyl only has one Br, but each has two Brs, so each would lose both Brs. Hmm, but wait, sodium iodide is a source of I-.

Wait, perhaps each dibromomethyl group (CBr2) reacts twice. So each CBr2 becomes CI2. So the product would have two CI2 groups attached to the cyclohexadiene. Or wait, maybe the cyclohexadiene is undergoing some kind of coupling with the norbornene?

Wait, maybe another approach. The starting compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a norbornene derivative. When norbornene derivatives react, especially with dienes, sometimes they undergo Diels-Alder reactions. But wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Hmm, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, which is a good diene for Diels-Alder.

Wait, but the norbornene is a dienophile? Or maybe it's acting as a diene? Hmm.

Wait, norbornene has two double bonds? Or no, it's a bicyclo structure with one double bond. Wait, no, the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So it's a bicyclic compound with a double bond at position 2. So when combined with another diene, perhaps a [4+2] cycloaddition occurs.

Alternatively, the presence of two equivalents suggests that maybe each of the two bromines on each methyl is being replaced by something.

Wait, but the problem mentions that it's combined with 2 equivalents of that diene and sodium iodide. So perhaps the norbornene is acting as a dienophile, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the diene. So the Diels-Alder reaction would form a new six-membered ring, adding the two components together.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has substituents at 5 and 6 positions. Let me visualize that. So the diene is cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and the substituents are at positions 5 and 6. So that would be across from each other on the ring.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would attack the dienophile (norbornene). The reaction would form a bicyclic structure, perhaps fusing the rings.

But wait, the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the two methyl groups at 5 and 6 has two Brs. So during the Diels-Alder reaction, these substituents would end up in specific positions in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is reacting with two equivalents of norbornene. Wait, no, the norbornene is the starting material, and the other reagent is the diene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So norbornene with an O-t-Bu group. Then it's reacted with 2 equivalents of this cyclohexadiene, which has two dibromomethyl groups.

But wait, the reaction is in presence of sodium iodide. So maybe it's a coupling reaction where the diene is being brominated or something. Or perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution.

Wait, another approach: the sodium iodide in a polar aprotic solvent would cause the Finkelstein reaction. So each CBr2 would substitute both bromides with iodides. So the diene becomes 5,6-bis(diodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

But how does that react with the norbornene?

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder happens first. So the norbornene (dienophile) reacts with the diene (cyclohexadiene) to form a new bicyclic compound. Then, in the presence of sodium iodide, the CBr2 groups are converted to CI2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sequence. Let's think. When you have a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene and dienophile combine to form a six-membered ring with two substituents from each reactant.

In this case, the diene is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and the dienophile is the norbornene.

So the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure where each of the methyl groups (with Br2) are added to the new structure.

Wait, but maybe the product after Diels-Alder is a bridge structure, incorporating the norbornene and the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, perhaps the product after the first reaction is a Diels-Alder adduct, where the norbornene has added the diene. So the product would have the bicyclo structure with the substituents from the diene, which are the two CBr2 groups.

But wait, wait a moment. How many equivalents are used? The question says 2 equivalents of the diene. So perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions happen, or maybe each equivalent adds once, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each diene molecule adds once to the norbornene, but since we have 2 equivalents, maybe two norbornene molecules are reacting with one diene each.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider the overall structure of the product after each step.

Let me try to outline each step:

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, elevated temperature.

Assuming Diels-Alder, each diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would react with a dienophile (norbornene) to form a bicyclic structure. But since there are 2 equivalents of diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding a diene to the norbornene. Or maybe the diene is the dienophile and norbornene is the diene? Wait, no, because norbornene is a strained dienophile, more likely to react as the dienophile.

Wait, but norbornene has a double bond, so as a dienophile, it would react with the diene.

So each diene molecule would add a norbornene unit. Wait, no, each diene would add one dienophile (norbornene) molecule. So with 2 equivalents of diene, two norbornene molecules would add? Or perhaps each diene can react with two dienophiles?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the structure after the first reaction.

After the reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Sulfuric acid is often used for acid-catalyzed reactions, like ring-opening of epoxides or elimination reactions.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which sounds like a sulfonation or possibly a sulfonamide formation, but more likely a sulfonation of an aromatic ring. Alternatively, SO3 is used for sulfonation, usually in presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. Wait, but in DMSO with pyridineâ€”that might be a Mitsunobu reaction or some kind of substitution, but more likely, it's a sulfonation.

Wait, but product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. Hmm, DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent, and pyridine could be a base. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So perhaps product 2 has an aromatic ring that's being sulfonated.

Finally, product 3 is heated at 150C to form product 4. Heating often leads to elimination or rearrangement. So perhaps a sulfonated group is lost, or an elimination occurs.

But maybe I should try to figure out each step and see what structures are formed.

Let me start over. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So it's a norbornene derivative, with a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

When this compound is reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps the diene is undergoing substitution reactions. Wait, but NaI is more about exchanging halides. So the dibromomethyl groups would become diiodomethyl groups.

But how does that tie into the norbornene?

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is opening up. Wait, norbornene can undergo ring-opening reactions, such as in Diels-Alder reactions. If the norbornene is the dienophile, then the diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would attack it.

Wait, but the diene in this case is substituted with two dibromomethyl groups. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the substituents would end up in specific positions on the new ring.

So each Diels-Alder would add a diene (with substituents) to the dienophile (norbornene). But since there are two dienes used, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts are formed?

Wait, perhaps each diene adds once to the norbornene, leading to two substituents on the product. Alternatively, the diene could be adding across the norbornene, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another thought: the norbornene molecule has two double bonds? No, wait, the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which has two double bonds? No, wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which has one double bond.

Wait, so the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, meaning there are two double bonds: one at position 2 and another at position 5? So it's a conjugated diene within the norbornene structure. Hmm, that's possible. So it's a bicyclic compound with two conjugated double bonds.

Wait, but the question states 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a bicyclo structure with double bonds at 2 and 5, making it a conjugated diene.

So that would make it more reactive as a dienophile. So when it reacts with another diene, it can undergo Diels-Alder.

Wait, but the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a diene with substituents. So perhaps the norbornene (acting as a dienophile) would react with each diene molecule.

Given that two equivalents of the diene are used, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding a diene to the starting norbornene.

Wait, but norbornene only has one dienophile site. So perhaps each diene adds once, leading to a more complex structure. Or maybe the product is a tricyclic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with the diene in a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's less common. More likely, it's a Diels-Alder.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is the dienophile and norbornene is the diene. Wait, norbornene is a strained dienophile, so more likely to react as such. But if it's a conjugated diene itself, maybe it can act as a diene.

Wait, maybe the norbornene's double bonds are in such a way that it can act as a diene. So perhaps the diene is the cyclohexadiene, and the norbornene is the dienophile.

So the Diels-Alder would form a new six-membered ring, connecting the diene and dienophile.

But I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should look up the structure.

Wait, norbornene has the bridge structure, with one double bond. So if the diene is another molecule, perhaps the Diels-Alder would form a new ring.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder but a cyclopropanation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product after the first step is treated with aqueous H2SO4. If the first step forms an epoxide, then H2SO4 might open it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction forms a diiodomethyl-substituted compound. Because the Finkelstein would convert Br to I. So the diene becomes 5,6-bis(diodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

But how does that react with the norbornene? Maybe the iodides are leaving groups, leading to some elimination or substitution.

Wait, maybe the norbornene is undergoing a ring-opening metathesis or some addition. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution with the tert-butoxy group.

Wait, no, sodium iodide and elevated temperature are more about Finkelstein. So the Br in the diene becomes I. So each diene's methyl groups have two I now.

But how does that tie into the norbornene? Perhaps the diene, after substitution, is then undergoing another reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is adding across the norbornene's double bonds.

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder is happening, adding the diene to norbornene, and each diene has two diiodomethyl substituents. So the product 1 would be a Diels-Alder adduct with two diiodomethyl groups attached.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to think about the later steps.

Step 2: product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. So H2SO4 in water. Maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening or elimination.

Step 3: product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. That sounds like a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, and pyridine might act as a base to deprotonate during the reaction. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent.

So product 2 must have something that can be sulfonated, like an aromatic ring or a double bond that can undergo electrophilic addition.

Step 4: product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. Heating can cause elimination (like losing a leaving group) or rearrangement.

Putting it all together, perhaps the final product has several substituents, and I need to count the distinct hydrogens.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a Diels-Alder, adding the diene to the norbornene, incorporating the diiodomethyl groups. Then, when treated with H2SO4, perhaps the diiodomethyl groups undergo some acid-catalyzed reaction, like substitution or elimination.

Wait, but diiodomethyl groups are quite bulky. Alternatively, perhaps the iodides are leaving groups. In acidic conditions, perhaps they hydrolyze or undergo elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Diels-Alder adds the diene to the norbornene, giving a bridged structure with the diiodomethyl groups attached. Then, treating with H2SO4 could protonate and cause elimination, forming a new double bond or ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe the diiodomethyl groups undergo substitution with water in acidic conditions, but that would require a good leaving group. I- is a better leaving group than Br, but in acidic conditions, perhaps substitution occurs.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct with diiodomethyl groups. Then, when treated with H2SO4, which is a strong acid, it could cause the diiodomethyl groups to undergo substitution, especially in an SN2 reaction. Since each has two I's, perhaps two substitutions occur, replacing I with something else, like H.

Wait, but what's the other possibility. Maybe the diiodomethyl groups lose HI in acidic conditions, leading to the formation of a double bond. So each diiodomethyl (CH2I2) could lose two HI molecules to become CH2.

Wait, but CH2 is not stable. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2I2 loses HI and becomes a double bond, but that would require dehalogenation.

Wait, but in acidic conditions, maybe each CH2I2 group loses two I- as leaving groups, forming a double bond. So CH2I2 â†’ CH2 (which is not possible, so maybe it becomes a diene). Wait, perhaps each diiodomethyl group loses two I's and forms a double bond adjacent to the existing structure.

Wait, but each diiodomethyl group has two I's, so losing both would require two departures. Maybe each CH2I2 becomes CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diiodomethyl groups are cleaved via elimination, releasing HI and forming a new double bond. So, each CH2I2 would become CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2I2 becomes a double bond, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the acid treatment isn't about the diiodomethyl groups but about the ring structure. If product 1 is a bicyclic structure, perhaps the acid causes it to open, forming a more complex structure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible product structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder is not happening, and the Finkelstein is the main reaction. So the diene's dibromomethyl groups are converted to diiodomethyl groups. Then, perhaps the next step involves some interaction between the diiodomethyl groups and the norbornene.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the norbornene is acting as a Lewis acid, coordinating to the I- in the diiodomethyl groups. Then, an elimination occurs, perhaps forming a new ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the diiodomethyl groups are undergoing some kind of substitution with the tert-butoxy group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene has a lone pair or some structure that allows the diiodomethyl groups to attack. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing a radical substitution, but that's probably not the case here.

Another thought: the norbornene has a bridgehead position (position 7) with a tert-butoxy group. Perhaps the diene, after substitution, is incorporating into the norbornene's structure through some addition.

But I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should look at the possible options for the number of distinct hydrogens.

The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. If the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule, it would have fewer distinct hydrogens. Alternatively, if it's a complex bridged structure with many substituents, it could have more.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane or something with high symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about each step again.

Step 1: Reaction between 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, NaI, elevated temp.

Assuming Finkelstein, the diene becomes 5,6-bis(diodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Then, maybe the diene adds to the norbornene via Diels-Alder, leading to a bridged structure with two diiodomethyl groups attached.

Step 2: Treat with aqueous H2SO4. Acid might cause elimination, forming additional double bonds or rings. Or perhaps the diiodomethyl groups undergo substitution, losing I- and forming something else.

Wait, diiodomethyl groups in acidic conditions could undergo substitution with water. So each CH2I2 would become CH2OH after substitution. But wait, substitution with two equivalents of water would require both I's to be replaced, so each CH2I2 would become CH2(OH)2.

But in aqueous H2SO4, perhaps the conditions are such that the diiodomethyl groups are converted to diol groups.

So product 2 would have two -CH2(OH)2 groups attached.

Step 3: Treat with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So any acidic protons, like on the diol groups, could be replaced by a sulfonic acid group. Or perhaps the diol is converted to a sulfonate ester.

Wait, but diols can be sulfonated, especially if they're in a position that allows for good leaving group formation. Alternatively, the diol might form a cyclic sulfonate.

Wait, another approach: Treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO is a classic sulfonation method. If product 2 has a diol group, then the hydroxyl groups could be converted to sulfonate groups. For example, each OH could be replaced by SO3H.

So product 3 would have two sulfonic acid groups attached where the diiodomethyl groups were.

Step 4: Heating product 3 at 150Â°C. Heating could cause the sulfonic acid groups to decompose or eliminate. Alternatively, the sulfonic acid groups might lose SO3 to form new structures.

Wait, but sulfonic acid groups are generally stable under heat. Unless elimination is possible.

Wait, another possibility: if the sulfonic acid groups are in a position that allows for elimination, maybe they form double bonds upon heating.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is a good leaving group. So when heated, it could leave, causing ring expansion or contraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is eliminated as SO2 and H2O, leaving behind a double bond.

Wait, but that's not a typical reaction. Sulfonic acids usually don't eliminate under thermal conditions. Alternatively, if the sulfonate group is ortho to another group, elimination could form a double bond.

Hmm.

But maybe I should think about the final structure. If the starting material is norbornene, and after Diels-Alder and other reactions, the final product could be a cubane-like structure, which is highly symmetrical, having fewer distinct hydrogens.

Wait, cubane has eight equivalent hydrogen atoms, each in a corner. So that would match option A)8.

Wait, but how would that happen?

If product 4 is cubane, then it would have eight equivalent hydrogens. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with multiple substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct hydrogens.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the overall process.

The first step adds two diiodomethyl groups via Diels-Alder, leading to a bicyclic structure with two CH2I2 substituents.

Second step: treatment with H2SO4 converts the CH2I2 groups to CH2(OH)2. 

Third step: sulfonation converts the OH groups to OSO3H.

Fourth step: heating at 150Â°C. If OSO3H groups are present, perhaps they are eliminated. For example, each sulfonate group could lose SO3 as a leaving group, forming a double bond. So each OSO3H group would leave, and the adjacent carbons would form a double bond.

If each substituent has a sulfonate group, their elimination would form two new double bonds, perhaps leading to a structure like cubane.

Wait, but cubane is a cube structure, which is highly symmetrical. Each corner would have a hydrogen, making eight distinct H's. Wait, but in cubane, all H's are equivalent, so only one type. But the question is about chemically distinct H's.

Wait, no, in cubane, each H is in a different position, but due to the symmetry, they might be equivalent. Wait, cubane has four equivalent pairs of H's. Or maybe all eight H's are equivalent. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think: cubane is a cube, with each corner having a CH group. Each CH is connected to three others. Due to the cube's symmetry, each H is in a position that's equivalent under rotation. So all eight H's are equivalent. So the number of chemically distinct H's would be 1.

But the options include 8, 4, 10, 7. So that doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure. Maybe the elimination forms a bridge, leading to a bicyclic structure with multiple substituents, each with different environments, leading to more distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is adamantane, which has more symmetry. Adamantane has 12 equivalent H's if I recall correctly, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the Diels-Alder adds two diene units to the norbornene, leading to a structure like a norbornene fused with two cyclohexene rings. Then, after substitution and sulfonation, elimination leads to a structure with multiple rings and substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct H's.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about each step's possible outcome.

Step 1: Diels-Alder adds two diene units to the norbornene, each bringing a diiodomethyl group. So product 1 is a tricyclic compound with two diiodomethyl groups attached.

Step 2: Acid treatment converts diiodomethyl groups to diol groups.

Step 3: Sulfonation converts diols to sulfonate groups.

Step 4: Heating eliminates the sulfonate groups, forming a new structure. Perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, leading to a more strained and rigid structure.

Alternatively, the elimination could form a bridged structure, leading to a compound with multiple rings.

Wait, if two sulfonate groups are eliminated, each elimination could form a double bond. So the final product would have two new double bonds where the sulfonate groups were.

But the starting material already has some double bonds. It's getting tricky.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornadiene derivative with additional substituents.

Alternatively, since each step adds more complexity, the final product might have several distinct hydrogen environments.

But without a clear structural path, it's hard to count the H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane, which has eight equivalent H's, but that would be one type, not eight distinct. So that can't be. So perhaps the final product is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclo structure with several substituents, leading to multiple distinct H's.

Wait, let's think about the options. The options are 8, 4, 10, 7.

If each sulfonate group is eliminated, forming a double bond, perhaps the structure becomes more rigid, and the H's around the rings become distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a bridged structure with several substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct H's.

Wait, another approach: maybe the final product is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, each leading to distinct H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has four distinct H's. That would be option B)4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the heating in step 4 causes the sulfonate groups to undergo some kind of rearrangement, leading to a structure where all H's are equivalent except for a few.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a highly symmetric molecule with only four distinct H's.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, and the fact that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the possible number of H's.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material is norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. The Diels-Alder adds two dienes, each bringing diiodomethyl groups. Then, after substitution and sulfonation, and elimination, perhaps the final product is a molecule with four distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps each step leads to a more complex structure, but the final product has 8 distinct H's.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Since I'm stuck, maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the first step: 2 equivalents of diene. Each diene contributes two substituents. So maybe in product 1, there are two diiodomethyl groups attached symmetrically.

Then, after acid treatment, they become diols. Then, sulfonated to di-sulfonates. Heating eliminates them, perhaps forming two double bonds.

If the elimination forms a structure with two new double bonds, perhaps it's a more conjugated system, leading to a structure with several rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a cubane-like structure, but with substituents.

Wait, but without knowing, I think the most plausible answer is 8, which would correspond to option A. But I'm not sure.


The problem involves a sequence of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which undergoes multiple transformations to yield a final product. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI**  
   - The starting material is a norbornene derivative with a tert-butoxy group.  
   - The diene (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene) reacts with the norbornene.  
   - Sodium iodide likely facilitates a Finkelstein reaction, converting the dibromomethyl groups to diiodomethyl groups.  
   - A Diels-Alder reaction is plausible, where the norbornene acts as a dienophile, and the diene forms a bicyclic adduct with two diiodomethyl substituents.

2. **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous Hâ‚‚SOâ‚„**  
   - Acidic conditions may lead to substitution or elimination reactions involving the diiodomethyl groups.  
   - The diiodomethyl groups likely convert to diol groups (-CHâ‚‚OHâ‚‚), forming a product with hydroxyl substituents.

3. **Step 3: Reaction with SOâ‚ƒ and pyridine in DMSO**  
   - Sulfonation occurs, converting the diol groups into sulfonate groups (-SOâ‚ƒH).  
   - The product now contains sulfonate groups at the positions where the diiodomethyl groups were originally located.

4. **Step 4: Heating at 150Â°C**  
   - Heating likely causes elimination of the sulfonate groups, forming new double bonds or altering the ring structure.  
   - The final product may be a rigid, highly symmetrical structure, potentially resembling cubane or a similar polycyclic compound.

### Symmetry and Hydrogen Count:
- If the final product is cubane-like, all eight hydrogens are equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in only one type of hydrogen.  
- However, the options provided (A: 8, B: 4, C: 10, D: 7) suggest a different outcome.  
- Considering the transformations, the final product likely has a structure with multiple distinct hydrogen environments.  
- Based on the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.

Answer: A
