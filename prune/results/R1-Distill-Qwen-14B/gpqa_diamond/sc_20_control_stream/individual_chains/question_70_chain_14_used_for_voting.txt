Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. 

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the reactions and what each substance is. 

The problem says solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Another reaction is C reacting with water, which reforms A and produces two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

So, I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let me try to map them out.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. C is bright red. Hmm, bright red makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, another thought: when metals react with something to form a bright red solid, maybe it's a sulfide? Or perhaps a compound of chromium or iron? Alternatively, could it be something else?

Wait, let's think about the number of equivalents. 8 equivalents of B reacting with A. That's a lot. For example, if B is a diatomic gas, maybe like O2 or Cl2. Let's say if B is Cl2, then 8 moles would be 4 moles of Cl2. So, perhaps A is something reacting with Cl2 in a 1:8 ratio.

Wait, another approach: when a solid reacts with a diatomic gas to form a product. Let me think about metals reacting with Cl2. Aluminum and Cl2 react, but I'm not sure about 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S8), but that doesn't seem to fit with the later reactions.

Wait, another thought. Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with D to form E. Then, E is extremely hazardous. So, maybe E is something like phosgene? Or perhaps something like chlorine trifluoride? Or maybe a highly toxic gas like sarin, but that might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. Let me revisit the first reaction. A is a solid, reacting with gas B. Let's say B is Cl2. Then, perhaps A is aluminum, which when reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions forms AlCl3. But wait, aluminum reacts with Cl2 under specific conditions, maybe in a combustion reaction. Let's think about the reaction: 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. But that’s a 3:2 ratio. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another angle: what about the reaction of sodium with chlorine? 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But again, not 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps the solid A is carbon. If B is something like oxygen, but 8 equivalents might be too much. Alternatively, maybe B is sulfur. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen.

Let me think about the product C. It's bright red, which makes me think of something like a chromium compound. Oh! I remember that potassium dichromate is orange, but maybe another chromium compound is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a product involving iodine, but that's usually紫 (purple) in solution.

Wait, another thought. The product C reacts with water to form A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So, if C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids, perhaps a metal sulfide? Or maybe something like a nitride?

Wait, if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak one, then when it reacts with water, it would produce the metal (or its oxide) and the corresponding acids. For example, if C is NaNO3, but that's not a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, wait, perhaps C is an acid salt, like NaHCO3, which upon heating would decompose into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But not exactly sure.

Wait, considering F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Maybe like sodium carbonate reacting with water? Wait, sodium carbonate would give NaOH and CO2, but that's more about basic salts. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like calcium carbide (CaC2), which reacts with water to form acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that's not giving two different acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is an ammonium salt. Wait, for example, ammonium carbonate decomposes into NH3, CO2, and H2O. But that's not two acids.

Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS or something. When sulfides react with water, they can produce H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. Wait, but if the metal hydroxide is of a metal that forms a strong acid, like Group 1 metals. For example, Na2S reacts with water to form 2 NaOH and H2S. But F being a strong acid, G a weak acid. So in that case, F would be H2S (weak), but wait, no, G is weak and F is strong. So perhaps the opposite: when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 (which is a weak base) and 2 NH3 (which is a weak base as well). Hmm, that's not giving acids. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite or carbonate. Wait, for example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), which upon hydrolysis would form NaOH (strong base, but F is a strong acid) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). Not quite matching, but maybe the acids are formed via another reaction.

Alternatively, considering C is a salt that, when it reacts with water, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Let's think about something like sodium hydrogen sulfate, NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^-; HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2- and H3O+). But I'm not sure if that's giving two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a metal dichromate. For example, K2Cr2O7 reacts with water and acid to form H2Cr2O7, but that might not fit here.

Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with water to produce A plus two acids. So the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong, G is weak. So if F is HCl (strong acid), and G is H2S (weak), then perhaps C is a salt containing both Cl and S, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, suppose C is PbO2 (lead dioxide). Reacting with water doesn't do much, but maybe in acidic conditions? I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the fact that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe others. But D and B in 1:1 gives H as a solvent. Let's think of possible reactions. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but that's 1:1? Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe D is something like H2S, but again not sure.

Wait, maybe D is a diatomic gas like F2. If B is Cl2 and D is F2, then 1:1 ratio would form, perhaps, ClF? But that's not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is H2, but that just forms H2O, which is a solvent.

Wait, another thought. If D is O2 and B is H2, then H is H2O. So D + B → H (H2O), which is a solvent. That fits. So in that case, D is O2 and B is H2.

But let's see if that fits elsewhere. Then, looking at the first reaction: A + 8 equivalents of H2 → C. So A is perhaps a metal that reacts with H2 in large amounts. For example, aluminum reacts with H2 under certain conditions? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide, but that doesn't fit with the next step.

Wait, maybe B is O2. Then, D is something else. Let's think again.

Wait, another angle: if product E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another clue. C reacts with D in stoichiometry 2 equivalents to form E. So if C is a compound, and D is a diatomic gas, perhaps E is a polyatomic molecule.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal chloride, and D is a diatomic gas like F2, then E could be a more highly chlorinated compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the overall scenario. So, A reacts with B to form C. C reacts with D to form E. Then, E is dangerous. Also, C with water forms A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt that when it hydrolyzes, forms a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, if C is sodium sulfide (Na2S), which when it reacts with water, produces NaOH (strong base, but F is an acid) and H2S (weak acid). But that's one acid. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitrate salt. Wait, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) when reacted with water doesn't produce any acid. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Like Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form NaOH and CO2. So CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but F would be H2CO3 (weak) and G would be something else. Hmm, not matching F as strong.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate. For example, Na2SO4. Doesn't hydrolyze much, so probably not.

Wait, another angle: if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. It can hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH. But again, F would be H2O or something, not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think of a common compound that when reacted with water produces two different acids. Oh! Maybe something like a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 (calcium carbide) reacts with water to form acetylene (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide. But that gives a base and an alkyne, not two acids.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, sodium oxide (Na2O) reacts with water to form NaOH, which is a strong base, but not an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to produce NaOH and O2. Hmm, but that's a base and oxygen, not acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a superoxide, but similar issue.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the second reaction. C + 2 D → E. E is dangerous. If D is a diatomic gas, maybe F2, but 2 equivalents would form something. Let's say C is something like SiF4, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a metal chloride, and D is a diatomic gas like O2. So, C (say, AlCl3) reacts with O2 to form something. Not sure.

Wait, I think I need to think about the most dangerous products. E is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps E is something like sarin gas, but that's a nerve agent and quite complex. Alternatively, maybe E is chlorine gas, but that's not produced from C and D in this scenario.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. Phosgene is produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here.

Alternatively, E could be something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I don't know the reaction conditions.

Wait, let me think about the reaction of C with D. If C is a chloride and D is O2, then maybe it forms ClO2 or something. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, and D is O2. Then, in the presence of O2, maybe C is oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a chloro compound. Let me think about A as a metal, say, iron. Iron reacting with Cl2 would form FeCl3. But 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 4 Cl2 molecules per Fe atom? Because 1 Fe reacts with 3 Cl2 to form FeCl3. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 4 molecules, so the ratio would be Fe : Cl2 = 1 : 4, which would form FeCl4? But wait, iron doesn't typically form FeCl4. Maybe it's a different metal.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is sulfur (S8). Reacting with Cl2 gas. But the reaction of S8 with Cl2 would form SCl2 or other chlorides. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A is phosphorus. Phosphorus reacts with Cl2 to form PCl3 or PCl5, but again, I'm not sure about the equivalents.

Wait, perhaps the 8 equivalents of B is O2. So if B is O2, then 8 moles would be 4 diatomic molecules. So for a reaction like A + 4 O2 → product. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: What if C is a transition metal oxide that is bright red? Chromium(VI) compounds are often orange, but maybe lead(II,IV) oxide is red. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, in this reaction, water is acting as a reactant. So perhaps C is a salt that reacts with water to produce a metal hydroxide and two acids.

Hmm, maybe C is a mixed salt. For example, something like NH4HSO4, which upon heating might decompose into NH4Cl and H2SO4. But when NH4HSO4 reacts with water, perhaps it dissociates into NH4+ and HSO4^-.

Wait, another thought: if C is sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4), then upon heating in water, it might produce Na2SO4, H2SO4, but that's not breaking into two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrate that upon hydrolysis releases two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that contains two different anions, each of which can hydrolyze to form an acid. For example, if C is something like NaHSO3, which might hydrolyze into H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but that doesn't give a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3, which when heated decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But that's not reacting with water; it's decomposition upon heating.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of E. E is produced by C and D in a 2:1 ratio. Also, D and B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O. Then, D and B reacting 1:1 would form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2, then D is H2O, and reaction would be Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But HCl is a strong acid, but the product is a mixture. However, the product H is a solvent, which is H2O. That doesn't make sense because H2O is the reactant.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2. So D + B → H2O (H). That makes sense because H2O is a solvent.

So if D is O2 and B is H2, then reaction D + B → H would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's correct.

So, with that, let's reevaluate the first reaction. A + 8 H2 → C. So A is a metal that reacts with hydrogen in large amounts.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with H2 under high pressure or temperature. For example, perhaps it's a transition metal or a metal that forms a hydride.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction of a metal with H2 to form a hydride. For example, Na and H2 can form NaH. But that's a 1:1 ratio. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 H2 per 1 mole of A. So A would be a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio with H2. Hmm, that's a bit odd. Maybe A is a nonmetal? Like sulfur? S8 + H2 → SH2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction under different conditions. Maybe it's a metal reacting with H2 to form a metal hydride, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that reacts with H2 to form a compound with multiple H atoms. For example, perhaps a transition metal forms a complex with H. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, Fe3O4 reacts with H2 to form Fe and water. But that's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with H2 to form a metal hydride. Let's say A is Na, and B is H2. Then, the reaction would be 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. But that's 1:1 ratio, not 8:1.

Hmm, perhaps A is an alloy or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a complex hydride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a dihydride or trihydride. For example, CaH2 is a common hydride. So, if A is Ca, and B is H2, then 1 Ca reacts with 1 H2 to form CaH2. But the reaction given is A + 8 equivalents of B → C. So that would be Ca + 8 H2 → CaH8? I don't think such a compound exists. Calcium typically forms CaH2.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think of the possible identity of E.

E is produced by C reacting with D. Since D is O2, and C is a product from A + 8 H2 → C. Let's think of C as a compound that upon reaction with O2 forms a dangerous product. For example, if C is a metal carbonyl, perhaps? Or maybe C is a highly reactive compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydride that reacts with O2 to form water and a metal oxide, but that doesn't sound dangerous per se.

Wait, another angle: if C is a superoxide, like KO2. Then when it reacts with O2, perhaps it forms Ozone (O3), which is dangerous. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Or maybe C is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, NaO2. Reacting with O2 could form O3, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or something that decomposes upon reaction with O2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a highly reactive metal. Wait, but then C reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide, which usually isn't extremely hazardous unless it's something like mercury or lead. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structure of E. E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a explosive compound.

Wait, another thought: E could be chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), but that's a strong oxidizing agent and highly reactive. But how would that form from C and D?

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. So, how would that form? Maybe from the reaction of CO with Cl2 under certain conditions.

But in our case, D is O2, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is another diatomic gas, like F2. Then, C reacting with F2 would form something like CF4 or similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if D is F2, then the reaction D + B → H (a solvent) would be B + F2 → H. If H is a solvent, perhaps H is HF (hydrofluoric acid), but that's a reaction of F2 with water: F2 + H2O → 2 HF + O2. So in that case, B would be H2O, but D is F2.

Wait, but then in this scenario, B is H2O. Then, the first reaction is A + 8 H2O → C. Hmm, but I'm not sure what that would form. Maybe A is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a hydroxide and release H2. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with water to form a hydroxide and hydrogen gas. For example, sodium metal reacts with water to form NaOH and H2. But the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2. So in that case, 2 equivalents of H2O per 2 Na atoms. So for 8 equivalents of H2O, if A is Na, then the reaction would be Na + 8 H2O → NaOH + 4 H2. But that would produce NaOH and H2, not a bright red product C. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try to think of a possible C and E.

Suppose C is a salt that when reacted with water gives two acids. So, perhaps C is a sulfite carbonate or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a diacid salt.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces F and G. Let's say F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). So, C would be something like a sulfide and chloride? Not sure.

Alternatively, if F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H3PO4 (moderate strength?), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a neutral salt that upon hydrolysis gives both acids. For example, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) reacts with water to form H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that's not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2, but that doesn't produce two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate) decomposes upon heating into N2O and H2O, but that's not two acids.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of E. If E is a highly symmetrical molecule, its molecular symmetry group would be something like D∞h, which is the symmetry of a linear molecule with infinite twofold axes.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. So, the possible symmetry groups are either C2 (a 2-fold rotation), D4h (a dihedral group with 4-fold rotation and mirror planes), D∞h (infinite dihedral, like O2 or CO2), or C2v (a 2-fold rotation and two vertical mirror planes).

If E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple axes, it might have D∞h symmetry. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. But E is produced in the reaction, which is extremely hazardous. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry.

Wait, another thought: phosgene (COCl2) is a linear molecule. Its structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is linear. The molecule has a center of inversion and a C2 axis, so its point group is D∞h. But wait, phosgene has a trigonal planar arrangement around the carbon, but the overall molecule is linear. So its symmetry group would be D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear, it would have D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h. But O2 isn't extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations, perhaps. Alternatively, O3 (ozone) has C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule. So its point group is D3h or C2v? Wait, ozone is a bent molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, making its point group C2v.

Wait, another example: CO2 is linear, so D∞h. H2O is bent, so C2v.

So, if E is a linear molecule, the symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, it would be C2v.

So, going back, what's E? It's produced from C and D in a 2:1 ratio. If D is O2, then C could be something that reacts with O2 to form a linear molecule. For example, CO (carbon monoxide) reacting with O2 to form CO2. But that would require C to be CO, which would require A + 8 H2 → CO.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps C is CH3Cl, which reacts with O2 to form CO2 and HCl. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but I don't know its structure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a chloride, and D is O2, then C + O2 → E. For example, if C is ClO (chlorine monoxide), which is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2. Then, reacting with O2 could form CO2 and ClO2. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a yellow-green gas, highly dangerous. ClO2 has a structure where Cl is in the center with four O atoms, but wait, no. Wait, ClO2 is a bent molecule with a Cl-O-Cl structure, so its point group is C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and two mirror planes. So the symmetry group would be C2v.

Wait, but I'm not certain about ClO2's structure. Let me think: ClO2 is a bent molecule with a Cl central atom, and two double bonds. Its molecular geometry is similar to O3, which is bent with a C2v symmetry.

So if E is ClO2, its symmetry group would be C2v.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, its symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, but in the reaction where C reacts with D to form E, if E is a linear molecule, then it's more likely to be D∞h. But if it's bent, then C2v.

So, putting it all together, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the answer is D∞h, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests a compound where A reacts with B in a 1:8 ratio. The bright red color hints at a compound like a metal chloride or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. This indicates that E is likely a highly reactive or toxic compound. The reaction between C and D suggests a transformation involving a diatomic gas (e.g., O₂ or F₂).

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This implies that C is a salt that hydrolyzes to form a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a sulfide or carbonate, it could produce H₂S (weak acid) and a strong acid like HCl.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. A plausible interpretation is that D is O₂ and B is H₂, as their reaction forms H₂O, a common solvent.

5. **Identity of E**: Given that E is extremely hazardous and produced by the reaction of C with D, it is likely a highly reactive or toxic gas. A plausible candidate is ClO₂ (chlorine dioxide), which is a bent molecule with the formula Cl=O-Cl. ClO₂ is known to be a dangerous environmental pollutant.

6. **Molecular Symmetry of E**: ClO₂ has a bent molecular geometry with a C₂ axis (180° rotation) and two vertical mirror planes. This corresponds to the molecular symmetry group **C₂v**.

Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C₂v**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. 

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the reactions and what each substance is. 

The problem says solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Another reaction is C reacting with water, which reforms A and produces two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

So, I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let me try to map them out.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. C is bright red. Hmm, bright red makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, another thought: when metals react with something to form a bright red solid, maybe it's a sulfide? Or perhaps a compound of chromium or iron? Alternatively, could it be something else?

Wait, let's think about the number of equivalents. 8 equivalents of B reacting with A. That's a lot. For example, if B is a diatomic gas, maybe like O2 or Cl2. Let's say if B is Cl2, then 8 moles would be 4 moles of Cl2. So, perhaps A is something reacting with Cl2 in a 1:8 ratio.

Wait, another approach: when a solid reacts with a diatomic gas to form a product. Let me think about metals reacting with Cl2. Aluminum and Cl2 react, but I'm not sure about 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S8), but that doesn't seem to fit with the later reactions.

Wait, another thought. Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with D to form E. Then, E is extremely hazardous. So, maybe E is something like phosgene? Or perhaps something like chlorine trifluoride? Or maybe a highly toxic gas like sarin, but that might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. Let me revisit the first reaction. A is a solid, reacting with gas B. Let's say B is Cl2. Then, perhaps A is aluminum, which when reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions forms AlCl3. But wait, aluminum reacts with Cl2 under specific conditions, maybe in a combustion reaction. Let's think about the reaction: 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. But that’s a 3:2 ratio. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another angle: what about the reaction of sodium with chlorine? 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But again, not 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps the solid A is carbon. If B is something like oxygen, but 8 equivalents might be too much. Alternatively, maybe B is sulfur. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen.

Let me think about the product C. It's bright red, which makes me think of something like a chromium compound. Oh! I remember that potassium dichromate is orange, but maybe another chromium compound is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a product involving iodine, but that's usually紫 (purple) in solution.

Wait, another thought. The product C reacts with water to form A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So, if C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two acids, perhaps a metal sulfide? Or maybe something like a nitride?

Wait, if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak one, then when it reacts with water, it would produce the metal (or its oxide) and the corresponding acids. For example, if C is NaNO3, but that's not a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, wait, perhaps C is an acid salt, like NaHCO3, which upon heating would decompose into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But not exactly sure.

Wait, considering F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Maybe like sodium carbonate reacting with water? Wait, sodium carbonate would give NaOH and CO2, but that's more about basic salts. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like calcium carbide (CaC2), which reacts with water to form acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that's not giving two different acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is an ammonium salt. Wait, for example, ammonium carbonate decomposes into NH3, CO2, and H2O. But that's not two acids.

Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS or something. When sulfides react with water, they can produce H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. Wait, but if the metal hydroxide is of a metal that forms a strong acid, like Group 1 metals. For example, Na2S reacts with water to form 2 NaOH and H2S. But F being a strong acid, G a weak acid. So in that case, F would be H2S (weak), but wait, no, G is weak and F is strong. So perhaps the opposite: when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 (which is a weak base) and 2 NH3 (which is a weak base as well). Hmm, that's not giving acids. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite or carbonate. Wait, for example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), which upon hydrolysis would form NaOH (strong base, but F is a strong acid) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). Not quite matching, but maybe the acids are formed via another reaction.

Alternatively, considering C is a salt that, when it reacts with water, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Let's think about something like sodium hydrogen sulfate, NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^-; HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2- and H3O+). But I'm not sure if that's giving two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a metal dichromate. For example, K2Cr2O7 reacts with water and acid to form H2Cr2O7, but that might not fit here.

Let me think about the reaction where C reacts with water to produce A plus two acids. So the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong, G is weak. So if F is HCl (strong acid), and G is H2S (weak), then perhaps C is a salt containing both Cl and S, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, suppose C is PbO2 (lead dioxide). Reacting with water doesn't do much, but maybe in acidic conditions? I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the fact that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe others. But D and B in 1:1 gives H as a solvent. Let's think of possible reactions. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but that's 1:1? Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe D is something like H2S, but again not sure.

Wait, maybe D is a diatomic gas like F2. If B is Cl2 and D is F2, then 1:1 ratio would form, perhaps, ClF? But that's not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is H2, but that just forms H2O, which is a solvent.

Wait, another thought. If D is O2 and B is H2, then H is H2O. So D + B → H (H2O), which is a solvent. That fits. So in that case, D is O2 and B is H2.

But let's see if that fits elsewhere. Then, looking at the first reaction: A + 8 equivalents of H2 → C. So A is perhaps a metal that reacts with H2 in large amounts. For example, aluminum reacts with H2 under certain conditions? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide, but that doesn't fit with the next step.

Wait, maybe B is O2. Then, D is something else. Let's think again.

Wait, another angle: if product E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is something like phosgene (COCl2) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another clue. C reacts with D in stoichiometry 2 equivalents to form E. So if C is a compound, and D is a diatomic gas, perhaps E is a polyatomic molecule.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal chloride, and D is a diatomic gas like F2, then E could be a more highly chlorinated compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the overall scenario. So, A reacts with B to form C. C reacts with D to form E. Then, E is dangerous. Also, C with water forms A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt that when it hydrolyzes, forms a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, if C is sodium sulfide (Na2S), which when it reacts with water, produces NaOH (strong base, but F is an acid) and H2S (weak acid). But that's one acid. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitrate salt. Wait, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) when reacted with water doesn't produce any acid. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Like Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form NaOH and CO2. So CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid), but F would be H2CO3 (weak) and G would be something else. Hmm, not matching F as strong.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate. For example, Na2SO4. Doesn't hydrolyze much, so probably not.

Wait, another angle: if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. It can hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH. But again, F would be H2O or something, not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think of a common compound that when reacted with water produces two different acids. Oh! Maybe something like a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 (calcium carbide) reacts with water to form acetylene (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide. But that gives a base and an alkyne, not two acids.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, sodium oxide (Na2O) reacts with water to form NaOH, which is a strong base, but not an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to produce NaOH and O2. Hmm, but that's a base and oxygen, not acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a superoxide, but similar issue.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the second reaction. C + 2 D → E. E is dangerous. If D is a diatomic gas, maybe F2, but 2 equivalents would form something. Let's say C is something like SiF4, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a metal chloride, and D is a diatomic gas like O2. So, C (say, AlCl3) reacts with O2 to form something. Not sure.

Wait, I think I need to think about the most dangerous products. E is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps E is something like sarin gas, but that's a nerve agent and quite complex. Alternatively, maybe E is chlorine gas, but that's not produced from C and D in this scenario.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. Phosgene is produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here.

Alternatively, E could be something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I don't know the reaction conditions.

Wait, let me think about the reaction of C with D. If C is a chloride and D is O2, then maybe it forms ClO2 or something. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, and D is O2. Then, in the presence of O2, maybe C is oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a chloro compound. Let me think about A as a metal, say, iron. Iron reacting with Cl2 would form FeCl3. But 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 4 Cl2 molecules per Fe atom? Because 1 Fe reacts with 3 Cl2 to form FeCl3. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 4 molecules, so the ratio would be Fe : Cl2 = 1 : 4, which would form FeCl4? But wait, iron doesn't typically form FeCl4. Maybe it's a different metal.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is sulfur (S8). Reacting with Cl2 gas. But the reaction of S8 with Cl2 would form SCl2 or other chlorides. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A is phosphorus. Phosphorus reacts with Cl2 to form PCl3 or PCl5, but again, I'm not sure about the equivalents.

Wait, perhaps the 8 equivalents of B is O2. So if B is O2, then 8 moles would be 4 diatomic molecules. So for a reaction like A + 4 O2 → product. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: What if C is a transition metal oxide that is bright red? Chromium(VI) compounds are often orange, but maybe lead(II,IV) oxide is red. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, in this reaction, water is acting as a reactant. So perhaps C is a salt that reacts with water to produce a metal hydroxide and two acids.

Hmm, maybe C is a mixed salt. For example, something like NH4HSO4, which upon heating might decompose into NH4Cl and H2SO4. But when NH4HSO4 reacts with water, perhaps it dissociates into NH4+ and HSO4^-.

Wait, another thought: if C is sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4), then upon heating in water, it might produce Na2SO4, H2SO4, but that's not breaking into two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrate that upon hydrolysis releases two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that contains two different anions, each of which can hydrolyze to form an acid. For example, if C is something like NaHSO3, which might hydrolyze into H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but that doesn't give a strong acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3, which when heated decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But that's not reacting with water; it's decomposition upon heating.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of E. E is produced by C and D in a 2:1 ratio. Also, D and B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O. Then, D and B reacting 1:1 would form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2, then D is H2O, and reaction would be Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But HCl is a strong acid, but the product is a mixture. However, the product H is a solvent, which is H2O. That doesn't make sense because H2O is the reactant.

Wait, perhaps D is O2 and B is H2. So D + B → H2O (H). That makes sense because H2O is a solvent.

So if D is O2 and B is H2, then reaction D + B → H would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's correct.

So, with that, let's reevaluate the first reaction. A + 8 H2 → C. So A is a metal that reacts with hydrogen in large amounts.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with H2 under high pressure or temperature. For example, perhaps it's a transition metal or a metal that forms a hydride.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction of a metal with H2 to form a hydride. For example, Na and H2 can form NaH. But that's a 1:1 ratio. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 H2 per 1 mole of A. So A would be a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio with H2. Hmm, that's a bit odd. Maybe A is a nonmetal? Like sulfur? S8 + H2 → SH2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction under different conditions. Maybe it's a metal reacting with H2 to form a metal hydride, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that reacts with H2 to form a compound with multiple H atoms. For example, perhaps a transition metal forms a complex with H. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, Fe3O4 reacts with H2 to form Fe and water. But that's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with H2 to form a metal hydride. Let's say A is Na, and B is H2. Then, the reaction would be 2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH. But that's 1:1 ratio, not 8:1.

Hmm, perhaps A is an alloy or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a complex hydride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a dihydride or trihydride. For example, CaH2 is a common hydride. So, if A is Ca, and B is H2, then 1 Ca reacts with 1 H2 to form CaH2. But the reaction given is A + 8 equivalents of B → C. So that would be Ca + 8 H2 → CaH8? I don't think such a compound exists. Calcium typically forms CaH2.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think of the possible identity of E.

E is produced by C reacting with D. Since D is O2, and C is a product from A + 8 H2 → C. Let's think of C as a compound that upon reaction with O2 forms a dangerous product. For example, if C is a metal carbonyl, perhaps? Or maybe C is a highly reactive compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydride that reacts with O2 to form water and a metal oxide, but that doesn't sound dangerous per se.

Wait, another angle: if C is a superoxide, like KO2. Then when it reacts with O2, perhaps it forms Ozone (O3), which is dangerous. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Or maybe C is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, NaO2. Reacting with O2 could form O3, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or something that decomposes upon reaction with O2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a highly reactive metal. Wait, but then C reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide, which usually isn't extremely hazardous unless it's something like mercury or lead. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structure of E. E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a explosive compound.

Wait, another thought: E could be chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), but that's a strong oxidizing agent and highly reactive. But how would that form from C and D?

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. So, how would that form? Maybe from the reaction of CO with Cl2 under certain conditions.

But in our case, D is O2, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is another diatomic gas, like F2. Then, C reacting with F2 would form something like CF4 or similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if D is F2, then the reaction D + B → H (a solvent) would be B + F2 → H. If H is a solvent, perhaps H is HF (hydrofluoric acid), but that's a reaction of F2 with water: F2 + H2O → 2 HF + O2. So in that case, B would be H2O, but D is F2.

Wait, but then in this scenario, B is H2O. Then, the first reaction is A + 8 H2O → C. Hmm, but I'm not sure what that would form. Maybe A is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a hydroxide and release H2. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with water to form a hydroxide and hydrogen gas. For example, sodium metal reacts with water to form NaOH and H2. But the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2. So in that case, 2 equivalents of H2O per 2 Na atoms. So for 8 equivalents of H2O, if A is Na, then the reaction would be Na + 8 H2O → NaOH + 4 H2. But that would produce NaOH and H2, not a bright red product C. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try to think of a possible C and E.

Suppose C is a salt that when reacted with water gives two acids. So, perhaps C is a sulfite carbonate or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a diacid salt.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces F and G. Let's say F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). So, C would be something like a sulfide and chloride? Not sure.

Alternatively, if F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H3PO4 (moderate strength?), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a neutral salt that upon hydrolysis gives both acids. For example, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) reacts with water to form H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that's not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2, but that doesn't produce two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate) decomposes upon heating into N2O and H2O, but that's not two acids.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of E. If E is a highly symmetrical molecule, its molecular symmetry group would be something like D∞h, which is the symmetry of a linear molecule with infinite twofold axes.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. So, the possible symmetry groups are either C2 (a 2-fold rotation), D4h (a dihedral group with 4-fold rotation and mirror planes), D∞h (infinite dihedral, like O2 or CO2), or C2v (a 2-fold rotation and two vertical mirror planes).

If E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple axes, it might have D∞h symmetry. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry. But E is produced in the reaction, which is extremely hazardous. Ozone (O3) has C2v symmetry.

Wait, another thought: phosgene (COCl2) is a linear molecule. Its structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is linear. The molecule has a center of inversion and a C2 axis, so its point group is D∞h. But wait, phosgene has a trigonal planar arrangement around the carbon, but the overall molecule is linear. So its symmetry group would be D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear, it would have D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if E is O2, then the symmetry group is D∞h. But O2 isn't extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations, perhaps. Alternatively, O3 (ozone) has C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule. So its point group is D3h or C2v? Wait, ozone is a bent molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, making its point group C2v.

Wait, another example: CO2 is linear, so D∞h. H2O is bent, so C2v.

So, if E is a linear molecule, the symmetry group would be D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, it would be C2v.

So, going back, what's E? It's produced from C and D in a 2:1 ratio. If D is O2, then C could be something that reacts with O2 to form a linear molecule. For example, CO (carbon monoxide) reacting with O2 to form CO2. But that would require C to be CO, which would require A + 8 H2 → CO.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps C is CH3Cl, which reacts with O2 to form CO2 and HCl. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but I don't know its structure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a chloride, and D is O2, then C + O2 → E. For example, if C is ClO (chlorine monoxide), which is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonyl chloride, like COCl2. Then, reacting with O2 could form CO2 and ClO2. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a yellow-green gas, highly dangerous. ClO2 has a structure where Cl is in the center with four O atoms, but wait, no. Wait, ClO2 is a bent molecule with a Cl-O-Cl structure, so its point group is C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and two mirror planes. So the symmetry group would be C2v.

Wait, but I'm not certain about ClO2's structure. Let me think: ClO2 is a bent molecule with a Cl central atom, and two double bonds. Its molecular geometry is similar to O3, which is bent with a C2v symmetry.

So if E is ClO2, its symmetry group would be C2v.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, its symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, but in the reaction where C reacts with D to form E, if E is a linear molecule, then it's more likely to be D∞h. But if it's bent, then C2v.

So, putting it all together, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the answer is D∞h, which is option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests a compound where A reacts with B in a 1:8 ratio. The bright red color hints at a compound like a metal chloride or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. This indicates that E is likely a highly reactive or toxic compound. The reaction between C and D suggests a transformation involving a diatomic gas (e.g., O₂ or F₂).

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This implies that C is a salt that hydrolyzes to form a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a sulfide or carbonate, it could produce H₂S (weak acid) and a strong acid like HCl.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. A plausible interpretation is that D is O₂ and B is H₂, as their reaction forms H₂O, a common solvent.

5. **Identity of E**: Given that E is extremely hazardous and produced by the reaction of C with D, it is likely a highly reactive or toxic gas. A plausible candidate is ClO₂ (chlorine dioxide), which is a bent molecule with the formula Cl=O-Cl. ClO₂ is known to be a dangerous environmental pollutant.

6. **Molecular Symmetry of E**: ClO₂ has a bent molecular geometry with a C₂ axis (180° rotation) and two vertical mirror planes. This corresponds to the molecular symmetry group **C₂v**.

Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C₂v**.

Answer: D
