Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—one major and one minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The major product's NOESY spectrum has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to find which two resonances are connected in the major product.

Hmm. Let me break this down piece by piece.

First, the dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration to an anhydride—so probably a cyclic anhydride since it's a dicarboxylic acid. The structure would have two carboxylic acid groups connected by an alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride ring.

The anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That region is typically aromatic or maybe an alkene proton. But wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about what those carbons could be. 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen (like in an ester or anhydride), and 165 is a carbonyl. Since it's an anhydride, the carbonyl would be around 165-180 ppm. So, the structure likely has two carbonyl groups from the anhydride.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, only a single peak at 7 ppm. If the alkene was cis, dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, maybe a five-membered ring. In such a structure, perhaps there's a double bond or an aromatic ring remaining? Or maybe the protons from the alkene are gone because they're dehydrated.

Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So, when it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride, which probably is a bridged structure, eliminating water. So the structure might be something like two carboxylic acid groups connected by a bridged oxygen in a ring. The double bond is gone because it's dehydrated.

So the anhydride structure would have an oxygen bridge. The carbonyl groups would be in the anhydride.

Now, the 1H NMR for the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a bit confusing. If the anhydride is symmetric, perhaps the protons are all equivalent. Alternatively, maybe there are no protons in the region—like, the structure doesn't have any protons near 7 ppm. Wait, that can't be right because the 1H NMR has a peak there. So maybe the protons are from an aromatic ring or an olefin.

Wait, but the starting material is a cis-alkene. Dehydration forms an anhydride, which removes the double bond. So perhaps the anhydride doesn't have any double bonds. Hmm, but then why is there a peak at 7 ppm? Maybe it's an aromatic ring? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the starting dicarboxylic acid already had an aromatic ring. But the question says it's a cis-alkene, not an aromatic group. So maybe the anhydride doesn't have any protons at 7 ppm. Wait, that's confusing—maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Alternatively, the anhydride could have a conjugated double bond elsewhere. But that's not clear.

Moving on. The next part is the reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So that's a diene, with four methyl groups attached. The structure is a cyclopentadiene, so it's a conjugated diene with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. Wait, but cyclopentadiene has five carbons. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would be a conjugated diene with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4 positions. But wait, the compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the cyclopentadiene is substituted with four methyl groups—probably at positions 1,2,3,4. So each of those carbons has a methyl group. Hmm.

When the anhydride reacts with this diene, it's likely undergoing some kind of Diels-Alder reaction. Because the anhydride is a dienophile. So the diene (cyclopentadiene) would react with the dienophile (the anhydride) in a [4+2] cycloaddition.

So the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with substituents. The products would have the substituents from the diene and the dienophile.

But the question states that the reaction yields two products: major and minor. Both have molecular formula C13H16O3.

So let's figure out the molecular formulas. The anhydride's formula: the starting dicarboxylic acid would have the formula CnH2nO4 (but wait, no—wait, a dicarboxylic acid has two COOH groups. So for example, HOOC-(something)-COOH. Dehydration would form the anhydride, losing a water molecule.

So if the dicarboxylic acid is HOOC-(R)-COOH, then the anhydride would be (R)OOC-COOR, but more precisely, an anhydride would have the structure O=C-O-CO-O, but in a cyclic form. So if the dicarboxylic acid is, say, HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, dehydration would form the cyclic anhydride, which would be O=C-O-CO-O connected via the CH2 groups. But in any case, the molecular formula of the anhydride would be two less H2O than the original acid. But I'm not sure if that's needed here.

The other reactant is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let me calculate its formula. Each methyl is CH3. The cyclopentadiene (1,3-cyclopentadiene) has five carbons, two double bonds (so four pi bonds? No, two double bonds would have four atoms involved. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, so it has two double bonds: positions 1-2 and 3-4. Then, each of positions 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group.

So each of those four positions has a CH3. So the formula is C5 (from cyclopentadiene) plus 4*(CH3) = 4*3=12 H from the methyl groups, and 4 carbons from the methyl groups. Wait, no: each methyl is a C and 3 H. So four methyl groups add 4 C's and 12 H's. The cyclopentadiene without substituents is C5H6 (since each double bond reduces two H's: 5 carbons with four H each would have 20 H, but with two double bonds, it's 20 - 4 = 16? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The parent structure is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. The formula for 1,3-cyclopentadiene is C5H6. When we add four methyl groups (each CH3), each substituent adds a carbon and three hydrogens. So four substituents add 4 C and 12 H. So the formula is C5+4=9 C and H6 +12 = H18. But wait, that can't be right. Because 1,3-cyclopentadiene has five carbons and two double bonds. Wait, let me think: each double bond reduces two H's. So for cyclopentane (C5H10), each double bond takes away two H's. So cyclopentene has C5H8, and cyclopentadiene (two double bonds) would have C5H6.

So when we attach four methyl groups (each CH3), we're adding four C and 12 H. So the formula would be C5+4=9, H6+12=18. So the formula is C9H18?

Wait no, wait: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) is substituted with a methyl. So each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each substitution adds a methyl group.

Wait, but the cyclopentadiene is already having double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. So each of these positions (1,2,3,4) is a CH group, but substituting a methyl would make them CH(CH3).

So the formula would be: each CH2 in cyclopentadiene becomes CH(CH3). So each substitution adds two H's per CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Let me count:

Original cyclopentadiene: C5H6.

Each substitution (adding a methyl group) at a position, which was a CH (since it's part of a double bond), changes to CH(CH3). So each substitution adds a CH3 group, which has three H's. But the carbon was previously CH, so adding CH3 would now have CH(CH3), which has two H's attached (since one H was present before substitution). So each substitution adds two H's. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the overall formula.

Wait, the parent is C5H6. Each methyl substitution adds a CH3 group. So four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) = 4 C and 12 H. So total formula is C5+4=9 C and H6+12=18 H. So the formula is C9H18?

Wait, but 1,3-cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four CH3 groups gives C5 +4*1= C9, and H6 +4*3= H18. So yes, C9H18.

So the reactant is C9H18.

The anhydride's formula: let's assume the original dicarboxylic acid is something like HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH. When it dehydrates, it forms the anhydride. The formula would be (HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH) → (O=C-O-CO-O) plus H2O. So the anhydride would have the same number of carbons as the acid minus nothing, because dehydration removes H2O. So if the acid is CnH2nO4 (since each COOH is O2 each, so two would be O4), the anhydride would be CnH2n-2O3. Because we lose H2O.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's say the acid is HOOC-R-COOH, where R is some alkyl chain. Dehydration would form R-OOC-COOR, but as a cyclic anhydride. So the formula would be R's formula plus O3 (since two COOH groups, each O2, but combining them into anhydride O3). Maybe not, but perhaps the exact formula isn't crucial here.

So when the anhydride reacts with the diene (C9H18), the product would have formula C(anhydride) + C9H18 minus any elimination.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene and dienophile (anhydride) combine, losing a small molecule? No, it's a cycloaddition, so no elimination. The products are the adducts, so the molecular formula would be the sum of the diene and dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride. Let's assume the anhydride has formula CxHyOz. The diene is C9H18. So the Diels-Alder product would be Cx+9 H(y+18) Oz'.

Wait, but both products have the formula C13H16O3. So x +9 =13 → x=4. So the anhydride must be C4H?O3? Wait, no, because the anhydride is from a dicarboxylic acid. Let me think: if the anhydride is C4H4O3. Because a dicarboxylic acid would be C4H6O4, which upon dehydration loses H2O to form C4H4O3.

Wait, let's check: HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Dehydration would form the cyclic anhydride, which is an oxolane (five-membered ring) with two carbonyl groups. So the formula would be C4H4O3.

So the reactants would be:

Anhydride: C4H4O3.

Diene: C9H18.

So the Diels-Alder product would be C4+9=13 C's, H4+18=22 H's, O3. But wait, the product has formula C13H16O3. So 22 H in reactants, product has 16. So I'm missing 6 H? That can't be right. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene which is C9H18.

Anhydride is C4H4O3.

So the product would be C13H22O3. But the question says the product has C13H16O3. So that's a problem. Hmm. Did I get the formula of the diene wrong?

Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene has five carbons, with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. Adding four methyl groups (each at positions 1,2,3,4), so each of those four positions has a CH3. So the formula is:

Each CH in the diene (positions 1,2,3,4) becomes CH(CH3), so each substitution adds two H (since CH has one H, CH(CH3) has two H). So for four substitutions, that's 4 *2 = 8 H added. Original diene is C5H6. So the substituted diene would be C5+4=9 C, H6+8=14 H. Wait, but each methyl is CH3, so each substitution adds a CH3 group. So each substitution adds (CH3 - H) because the position was CH before. So each substitution adds (3 H from CH3). So four substitutions add 4 *3 = 12 H. Original diene is C5H6. So new formula is C9 (5+4), H18 (6+12). So yes, the diene is C9H18.

Anhydride is C4H4O3. So reactants are C4H4O3 (anhydride) + C9H18 (dienophile? Or diene? Wait, the anhydride is the dienophile; the cyclopentadiene is the diene.

So Diels-Alder adds four carbons from the diene and two from the dienophile (since the dienophile is the anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups, perhaps one of which becomes part of the six-membered ring.

Wait, no: the Diels-Alder reaction is between a diene (four pi electrons) and a dienophile (two pi electrons). The diene is the cyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene.

So in the Diels-Alder, the diene (four carbons) reacts with a dienophile (two carbons). So the dienophile must be a two-carbon compound, like the anhydride.

Wait, but the anhydride in this case is a four-carbon molecule (like succinic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring, but the main chain is four carbons: O=C-(CH2)2-C=O, but in a ring with the two oxygen atoms.

So the dienophile is the anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups. But when it reacts, the dienophile would contribute two carbons (the two carbonyl carbons) to the six-membered transition state.

Wait, wait. The dienophile is the anhydride. The structure of the anhydride is a cyclic structure, perhaps like:

O
||
O-C-(CH2)n-C-O
              ||
O

But more accurately, it's a five-membered ring if n=2. So in succinic anhydride, it's O=C-(CH2)2-C=O in a ring with two oxygen atoms.

So when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (cyclopentadiene) reacts with the dienophile (anhydride), which contributes two carbons (the two carbonyl carbons) to the new six-membered ring.

So the product would have the structure where the diene's four carbons and the dienophile's two carbons form a six-membered ring. So the product would have substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

So the product would have the substituents from the diene (the four methyl groups) and the substituents from the dienophile (the two carbonyl groups which would become part of the ring and possibly ester groups).

Wait, but the product's formula is C13H16O3. Let's check:

Anhydride: C4H4O3.

Diene: C9H18.

Sum: C13H22O3.

But product is C13H16O3. So there's a loss of 6 H. Hmm. That suggests perhaps the reaction forms a ring, which typically doesn't change the H count, but maybe there's some hydrogen lost elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the molecular formulas.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is not the anhydride but something else. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is the anhydride, but the product is something else. Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't Diels-Alder? But the options given suggest it's a cycloaddition.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is acting as a dienophile, and the diene is the cyclopentadiene. So the product would have the combined number of carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. The Diels-Alder adduct would be a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

The diene is a tetramethyl cyclopentadiene, which upon reacting would contribute four methyl groups (since each of the four positions has a methyl). The dienophile (the anhydride) contributes two carbonyl groups, which would end up as ester groups or ketones in the adduct.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile's double bond becomes part of the six-membered ring. So the two carbonyl groups would end up as substituents on the ring.

So the product would have a six-membered ring with substituents from the diene (four methyl groups) and the dienophile (two carbonyl oxygens, perhaps as ester groups).

Wait, but the product's formula is C13H16O3. Anhydride is C4H4O3, diene is C9H18. So 4+9=13 C, correct. O: 3 O in anhydride, plus any from the diene? The diene is C9H18, which has no O. So the product has O3. So 4+9=13 C, 4+18=22 H, but product has 16 H. So 6 H less. That suggests that perhaps some H are lost, but in Diels-Alder, the ring formation typically doesn't lose H. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps the anhydride has a structure where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, making it a good dienophile. So when it reacts with the diene, a six-membered ring is formed with the two carbonyl groups as substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product adds four substituents (the four methyl groups) and two carbonyl groups. So the ring would have six members, with substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a symmetrical anhydride. If the anhydride is symmetrical, then the Diels-Alder could give a single product. But the question says two products are formed, major and minor. So perhaps the anhydride isn't symmetric, leading to different regiochemistry in the adduct.

Wait, but the problem states that the anhydride has a single peak in its 1H NMR at 7 ppm. That suggests symmetry. So maybe the anhydride is symmetrical, leading to a single product. But the reaction produces two products. Hmm, maybe the diene is symmetric as well, but the reaction can proceed in different ways, leading to different diastereomers.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a highly symmetric molecule. So the diene is symmetric across the center. So when reacting with a symmetric dienophile, the Diels-Alder would give a single product. But in the question, two products are formed. So perhaps the dienophile isn't symmetric.

Wait, the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR. That suggests that all protons are equivalent, or it has no protons. Wait, in the anhydride, if it's cyclic and symmetric, perhaps all the non-carbonyl protons are equivalent. Or maybe the anhydride has no protons, but that's unlikely because the dienophile would have some.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride's structure has no protons in the NMR. But that can't be, because the 1H NMR shows a peak at 7 ppm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

If the anhydride is symmetric, meaning both sides are the same, then the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed in a way that forms a single product. But the question states that two products are formed, so perhaps the dienophile isn't symmetric, which leads to different products.

Wait, but the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak. That suggests that all the protons on the dienophile are equivalent. So perhaps the dienophile is like succinic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring with two ethylene groups. Wait, no, succinic anhydride is a cyclic structure, so the protons on the CH2 groups would be equivalent, leading to a single peak.

Wait, in succinic anhydride, the structure is a five-membered ring with two CH2 groups. The protons on the CH2 would be equivalent, giving a singlet. But in the 1H NMR, the peak is at 7 ppm, which is more like an aromatic proton. Hmm, but succinic anhydride's protons are around 4.5-5 ppm as a quartet. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has an aromatic ring. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride without the alkene. So maybe the anhydride has an aromatic ring elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride's structure has a conjugated system, leading to protons that resonate around 7 ppm. For example, if the anhydride has a benzene ring, but I don't see how that would form from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene.

Wait, maybe the dicarboxylic acid is something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH. Dehydration would form the cyclic anhydride, which is succinic anhydride. But the 1H NMR of succinic anhydride shows the two CH2 groups as a quartet around 4.5 ppm. So that doesn't match the given data of a 7 ppm peak.

Hmm, maybe the anhydride is not succinic anhydride but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 7 ppm peak isn't from the dienophile's protons but from the diene's protons. But the dienophile is the anhydride, which in the Diels-Alder would form the adduct, so the 7 ppm peak is from the product.

Wait, no, the 1H NMR data is for the anhydride before the reaction. So the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. So if the anhydride has no protons, that can't be. But wait, anhydrides are typically oxygen bridges without protons except in certain cases. Wait, perhaps if the anhydride is a bridged structure without any CH groups, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride doesn't have any protons, but that can't be because the 1H NMR shows a peak. So I must be missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride has a double bond elsewhere, leading to protons that resonate at 7 ppm. But that would require the anhydride to have a double bond, which would mean the dehydration didn't eliminate all the double bonds, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak is from an aromatic ring that's part of the anhydride. But I don't see how that would form from the given starting material.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is not a cyclic one but a linear one, like HOOC-CO-O-R-O-COOH, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a symmetrical anhydride where all the non-carbonyl protons are equivalent, leading to a single peak.

But I'm not making progress on the anhydride's structure. Let me try to think about the reaction and the products.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring. The diene is the cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. The dienophile is the anhydride, which contributes two carbons (the carbonyl carbons). So the adduct would have the four methyl groups from the diene and two carbonyl groups from the dienophile.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let me think: the diene is C9H18, the anhydride is C4H4O3. Sum: C13 H22 O3. Product is C13 H16 O3. So 6 less H. Where did those H go? Maybe because the dienophile's structure contributes some rings or double bonds which reduce the H count.

Wait, but Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. So the diene is conjugated, and the dienophile is a double bond. The product has a six-membered ring with substituents. So the H count would be (diene H + dienophile H) minus any lost in the reaction.

Wait, diene has 18 H, dienophile has 4 H (since anhydride is C4H4O3—so four H's). So total H before reaction: 18+4=22. Product has 16. So 6 H's lost. Hmm, that's a big loss. Maybe I'm miscalculating the dienophile's H.

Anhydride: C4H4O3. So four H's. Diene: C9H18. So 18 H's. Sum 22. Product: 16. So 6 H's lost. That suggests that some H's are lost, perhaps due to ring formation or double bonds. So maybe the product has a ring and some double bonds.

Wait, the Diels-Alder product is a bicyclic compound? Or just a six-membered ring with substituents. Let me think. The product would have a six-membered ring, so that's a ring with five bonds, which would have one less H than a straight chain. But I'm not sure how that adds up.

Alternatively, maybe the product has an ester group or a ketone, which would account for some H loss.

Another point: the minor and major products have the same molecular formula but different NMR spectra. The NOESY spectrum of the major product has a cross-peak, which suggests that there's a spatial proximity of two protons. In the minor product, that cross-peak is absent or weak, implying that the two protons are not close in space.

So the major product is more likely to have a cis arrangement where two protons are on adjacent carbons, leading to an NOE effect. The minor product would have a trans arrangement, where the protons are on opposite sides and don't show an NOE.

So, in the major product, two protons are close, leading to a cross-peak. Looking at the options, the cross-peak connects two specific resonances.

The options are about which two signals are connected. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So, the cross-peak in the major product connects two protons that are spatially close. Which of these options would indicate that?

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule often leads to the more substituted product, which is the major product. So the major product would have substituents on the same face of the ring.

Looking at the structures, perhaps the endo transition state leads to substituents being on the same face, leading to protons that are adjacent in space.

Wait, but the substituents are the methyl groups from the diene and the carbonyl groups from the dienophile.

In the major product, perhaps the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to protons that are close. But wait, the diene has four methyl groups, each on positions 1,2,3,4. So in the adduct, those methyl groups would be attached to the six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents from the dienophile (the carbonyl groups) are at positions that are adjacent to the methyl groups in the major product.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the product has two ester groups from the dienophile, and the methyl groups from the diene. So in the product, the ester groups are attached to the ring, and the methyl groups are attached to adjacent carbons.

In the major product, the substituents are cis, so the methyl groups are on the same face, leading to methyl protons that are close to each other. Alternatively, the ester groups might have protons that are near the methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two CH3 groups adjacent to each other, leading their protons to be close and show an NOE effect.

Looking at the options:

Option C connects two singlets, both likely from CH3 groups. 6H at 1 ppm and 6H at 1.7 ppm. If these are two sets of equivalent methyl groups that are close in space, that could explain the cross-peak.

Option A connects a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. Perhaps the 1H is a methylene proton next to a CH3 group.

Option B connects a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet.

Option D connects a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder product, the ring would have substituents at specific positions. Let's imagine the six-membered ring with substituents on adjacent carbons. For example, the endo transition state would place the substituents on the same face.

Suppose the major product has two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, leading their protons to be close. So in the NMR, each methyl group would be a singlet (if symmetry makes them equivalent). But if they are adjacent and on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to an NOE effect.

So for example, if there are two methyl groups (each with 6H, perhaps), but that seems unlikely because each CH3 is 3H, so 6H would mean two CH3 groups. But each methyl group is 3H, so two groups would be 6H total.

Wait, so option C has two 6H singlets. If those are two separate methyl groups, each with 3H, but being equivalent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps they're the same group.

Wait, another approach: the NOE cross-peak connects two protons that are close in space. So in the product, perhaps two sets of protons are on adjacent carbons or close in space. For example, a CH2 group next to a CH3 group.

Looking at the options, option A is a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. 1H could be a CH2 group split into a doublet. 6H singlet at 1 ppm could be CH3 groups.

But how would a CH3 and a CH2 be close? Maybe if the CH3 is attached to the same carbon as the CH2. Or perhaps the CH3 is adjacent.

Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. 2H could be a CH2 group. The 1H doublet could be a CH next to a CH2.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak connects two protons that are vicinal (on adjacent carbons) in the ring.

Wait, but in the major product, the substituents are cis, so perhaps their protons are on the same face, leading to proximity.

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule leads to the substituents being on the same face. So the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) would be on the same face as the substituents from the diene.

So, if the dienophile has two substituents (like ester groups), and the diene has four methyl groups, the endo transition state would have the substituents from both on the same face of the ring.

So, in the major product, perhaps the two ester groups are adjacent, or perhaps the methyl groups are arranged in a way that their protons are close.

Wait, but the product is a bicyclic structure? Or just a six-membered ring with substituents.

Another angle: the 13C NMR of the anhydride shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is likely a carbonyl carbon (from the anhydride), and 137 could be a carbon adjacent to an oxygen or part of the ring.

So the anhydride has two carbons besides the oxygen ones: one at 137 ppm and one at 165. Wait, but an anhydride would have two carbonyl carbons (around 165 ppm each), and the other carbons would be the ones from the R group. So perhaps the anhydride has a structure where the R group is a single carbon, making the anhydride a five-membered ring with two carbonyls and a CH2 group.

Wait, but if it's a five-membered ring (like succinic anhydride), it would have two CH2 groups between the carbonyls. So the carbons in the CH2 would be around 30-40 ppm, but the 137 ppm is higher, which might not fit.

Alternatively, the anhydride could have a different structure, perhaps with a substituted group leading to a carbon at 137 ppm.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

In the major product, the cross-peak is between which two resonances. The cross-peak suggests that the two sets of protons are spatially close, so perhaps they are on adjacent carbons.

Looking at the options, option A connects a 6H singlet (possibly two CH3 groups) and a 1H doublet (perhaps a CH2 group split into a doublet). So the CH3 and CH2 are adjacent.

Option B connects a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. 2H singlet could be a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen (e.g., an ester group). The 6H singlet could be two CH3 groups.

Option C connects two 6H singlets. If both are CH3 groups, perhaps they're on adjacent carbons.

Option D connects a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. Maybe a CH group next to a CH2.

In the Diels-Alder product, the substituents from the diene (the four methyl groups) are on adjacent carbons in the six-membered ring. So perhaps two of them are adjacent, and their protons are close, leading to an NOE effect.

If the product has two methyl groups (each 3H) on adjacent carbons, their protons would be close, leading to an NOE. But in the options, the only one that shows two methyl groups is option C, where each is a 6H singlet (but that would imply two sets of 3H each).

Wait, option C has two 6H singlets. So that would be 12 H, but the product has only 16 H. Hmm, but in the product, the four methyl groups from the diene would contribute 4*3=12 H. So perhaps the two 6H singlets are the four methyl groups split into two different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile contributes some protons. But the dienophile is the anhydride, which may not have protons, or maybe it does.

Wait, if the anhydride is succinic anhydride, which has two CH2 groups, each with 2 H. So in the Diels-Alder product, those CH2 groups would become part of the six-membered ring, perhaps as bridgehead groups.

Wait, no. The Diels-Alder adds the dienophile's two carbons into the ring. So the CH2 groups from the anhydride become part of the bridge in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a symmetrical anhydride, so the Diels-Alder product would have two equivalent substituents from the dienophile.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think about the NOESY. The major product has a cross-peak, implying that two protons are close in space. So in the structure, these two protons must be on adjacent carbons or close in the ring.

Looking at the options, the cross-peak in the major product connects either a singlet and a doublet, or two singlets.

Option C suggests that two 6H singlets are connected. That would imply that the two sets of protons are in close proximity. But 6H each would be two CH3 groups, so perhaps two methyl groups are adjacent, leading their protons to interact.

Alternatively, the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm could be from two equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be from an oxygen-bearing CH2 group. If the two methyl groups are adjacent to the CH2 group, there might be a spatial proximity, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the coupling in the 1H NMR. The 1H doublet in option A and D suggests a proton that has one neighboring proton. For example, a CH2 group next to another CH2 would be a quartet, but a CH2 next to a CH would be a triplet. A doublet would imply only one neighboring proton, which is less common unless it's a CH group adjacent to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the 1H doublet is part of an axial-equatorial arrangement in a ring, leading to only one neighboring proton being close.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1H is part of a geminal arrangement, but that's not typical.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options and their implications.

Option C: two 6H singlets. If these are two sets of equivalent methyl groups, perhaps they're on adjacent carbons in the ring. So their protons would be close, leading to an NOE effect.

So if in the major product, two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

In the minor product, perhaps the same two methyl groups are trans, so the protons are not close, leading to no cross-peak.

So the cross-peak would connect the two 6H singlets, which are from two adjacent methyl groups.

Looking at the options, option C is the only one that connects two singlets.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form a symmetrical anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major and a minor product, both with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product shows a cross-peak in its 2D NOESY spectrum, indicating spatial proximity between two sets of protons, while the minor product does not.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Anhydride Structure**:  
   The anhydride is derived from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride, likely a five-membered ring. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. These data suggest a symmetrical structure with carbons adjacent to oxygen (137 ppm) and a carbonyl group (165 ppm). The anhydride likely has no protons in the 7 ppm region, as succinic anhydride (a common example) has protons resonating around 4.5 ppm. This discrepancy suggests the anhydride may have a unique structure or the 7 ppm peak arises from another part of the molecule.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The reaction involves the anhydride (dienophile) and the tetramethyl cyclopentadiene (diene). The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring, with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The diene contributes four methyl groups, while the anhydride contributes two carbonyl groups. The reaction yields two products due to different regioselectivities or stereochemical outcomes.

3. **Molecular Formula and Hydrogen Count**:  
   The anhydride (C4H4O3) and the diene (C9H18) combine to give a product with C13H22O3. However, the product formula is C13H16O3, indicating a loss of 6 hydrogens. This is consistent with the formation of a six-membered ring and the elimination of hydrogens during bond formation.

4. **NOESY Spectrum**:  
   The NOESY spectrum of the major product shows a cross-peak, indicating spatial proximity between two sets of protons. The minor product lacks this cross-peak, suggesting a different spatial arrangement. The major product likely has a cis configuration, where substituents are on the same face of the ring, leading to close proximity between protons. The minor product, with a trans configuration, has protons that are farther apart.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This suggests a CH3 group and a CH2 group. However, the CH3 and CH2 would need to be adjacent for an NOE effect, which is less likely given the structure.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This suggests two CH3 groups and a CH2 group. The CH3 and CH2 could be close, but this option does not align well with the expected spatial arrangement in the major product.  
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two CH3 groups. If these methyl groups are on adjacent carbons in the ring, their protons would be spatially close, leading to an NOE effect. This matches the expected configuration of the major product.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This suggests a CH group and a CH2 group. While possible, this configuration is less likely to produce the observed NOE effect in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The major product likely has two methyl groups on adjacent carbons in the six-membered ring, leading to spatial proximity and an NOE effect. This aligns with **Option C**, where two 6H singlets correspond to two CH3 groups in close proximity.
