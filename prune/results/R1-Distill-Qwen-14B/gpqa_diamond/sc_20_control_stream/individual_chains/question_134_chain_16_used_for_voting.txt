Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember from class that neutralization reactions involve an acid reacting with a base to produce water and a salt. But wait, let me think about the specifics here.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed. Oh right, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, typically producing water. But wait, wait, these are all being mixed together. So maybe I should consider each reaction separately and sum up their contributions.

Wait, but first, let me note the volumes and molarities. HCl is 500 mL of 0.2 M. H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. So I need to find the moles of each substance involved.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but wait, in solution, how does it dissociate? H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait no. Wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first proton. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation: it donates two H+ ions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first H+ is strong, so H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. No, wait, no. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Hmm, perhaps I should double-check. No, wait, I think I'm confusing it. Let me think: sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but for the first dissociation, it's H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-, but wait, that can't be right because in reality, the first H+ is strong, but the second isn't. Oh wait, no. No, the first dissociation is complete, the second is not. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- would be incorrect. Wait, no. H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- is the first step, which is complete. Then HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2- is the second, which is weaker, so not complete. So in solution, the H2SO4 would provide 2 H+ per molecule, but only the first dissociation is complete. Wait, but in the problem, since it's a strong acid, perhaps the second H+ is considered strong as well? Wait, no, the second H+ is a weaker acid. But for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps we can consider the total H+ available.

Wait, but in neutralization reactions, the H+ from the acid will react with the OH- from the base. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Wait, the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Let's see. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Its formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

So, for each solution, I'll calculate the moles:

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. HCl → H+ + Cl^-, so 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2- (but wait, as I thought earlier, the first dissociation is complete, so for the purpose of H+ ions, each H2SO4 gives 2 H+? Oh wait, no. Because the second H+ isn't completely dissociated. Wait, but for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps we should consider the available H+ ions. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the amount of H+ each acid can contribute. HCl is a strong acid, so it donates all its H+.

H2SO4, being a diprotic acid, donates 2 H+ per molecule. But wait, the first H+ is strong, so it completely donates. The second H+ may not be as strong. But in neutralization, I think we can assume both are available. Or perhaps not. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. But I think for the sake of this problem, I should consider both H+ per H2SO4 molecule because it's a strong acid. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

So H2SO4: 0.09 moles × 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait a second: the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

In a neutralization reaction, H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

So the total moles of H+ available is HCl's H+ plus H2SO4's H+.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ and OH- moles are 0.28 and 0.2, respectively.

So the neutralization reaction will involve the limiting reagent. The OH- is 0.2 mol, H+ is 0.28 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent.

So all 0.2 mol of OH- will react with 0.2 mol of H+ to produce 0.2 mol of H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol, which doesn't react.

Wait, but wait, what about the other H+ from H2SO4? Since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, it can donate two H+ ions. So if the first H+ is neutralized, but the second isn't, perhaps the H+ from H2SO4 is in two steps. But for the neutralization, all H+ (from both HCl and H2SO4) are available to react.

So the neutralization reaction would proceed until either H+ or OH- runs out.

So in this case, OH- is the limiting reagent. So the reaction will consume 0.2 mol OH-, and 0.2 mol H+.

The enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is generally the heat released per mole of H+ neutralized. The standard value is about -57 kJ/mol (or sometimes given as -1.0 kcal/mol if using older units, but I think in most cases, it's in kJ). Wait, what unit is used here? The options are in kcal and kJ, so perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, the question is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat change per mole of acid (or base) reacting. Or per mole of H+.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the enthalpy when these three are mixed, so it's the total enthalpy change for the reaction.

So first, find how much H+ and OH- are present.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the neutralization will involve 0.2 mol OH- reacting with 0.2 mol H+.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

Now, the enthalpy change for the neutralization is the amount of heat released when these 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases a certain amount of heat. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or sometimes given as -1.0 kcal/mol, but I think in most cases it's about -57 kJ).

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about the units here. The options are in kcal and kJ. For example, option D is -16.0 kJ, others are in kcal. Oh, but wait, I should note that 1 cal = 4.184 J, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or H2O formed). Alternatively, sometimes it's given as -1.0 kcal per equivalent, but that might be more for older data.

Wait, let me think. I think the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, but I'm not entirely certain.

So, for each mole of H+ neutralized (which produces one mole of H2O), the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ.

In this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, wait a second, but wait, I'm not sure if the H2SO4 contributes two H+ or just one. Because if H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the second H+ doesn't dissociate completely, perhaps only the first one is considered in the neutralization. But in the problem statement, since it's given as a strong acid, H2SO4 is considered to completely dissociate both H+ ions.

Wait, but I think in reality, H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+ but not the second. So for H2SO4, only the first H+ is available for neutralization, and the second is weak. But wait, in the problem statement, the setup is that all H+ is available. Hmm, this is a point where I might get stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ from H2SO4 are available. So it's 0.09 mol H2SO4 × 2 H+ = 0.18 mol H+.

So, the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2.

So the reaction uses 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH- to make 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but wait, 57 kJ is approximately 13.56 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ; 57 /4.184 ≈13.56 kcal/mol). So 0.2 mol would be 0.2 × 13.56 = 2.712 kcal. But that's only about -2.71 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck: 57 kJ per mole is the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed. So 0.2 moles would be 57 * 0.2 =11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal. That's a small discrepancy, perhaps due to more precise calculations.

Wait, but wait, if the neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+, then 1 mole of H+ gives off about 57 kJ of heat. So 0.2 moles would give off 11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, but that's higher. Option B is in kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (because 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). So -11.4 kJ is approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but hold on. Alternatively, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ per mole of acid, but that's not correct because acids can be monoprotic or diprotic. For strong monoprotic acids, the neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or H2O). For diprotic acids, like H2SO4, the first H+ contributes about -57 kJ, and the second might be around -5 kJ (since the second dissociation is weaker). But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering the neutralization as the reaction between the strong acid and the strong base, so it's a complete neutralization, but given that the H2SO4 is diprotic, perhaps we need to account for both H+ ions.

Wait, but in this case, the moles of OH- are 0.2, which can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the H+ comes from HCl (0.1) and H2SO4 (0.09 ×2=0.18 → total 0.28). So, 0.2 from either would be neutralized. So, which H+ is neutralized first? I think the strong acid H+ would be neutralized first, then any weak.

But HCl is a strong acid, so both HCl and the first H+ of H2SO4 are strong. The second H+ from H2SO4 is weaker. So, perhaps the 0.2 mol OH- will first neutralize the 0.1 mol from HCl, then 0.1 mol from H2SO4's first H+.

But regardless, the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, so the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option with -11.4 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recheck the molarities and volumes.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ will react.

So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol.

But wait, each mole of H+ produces one mole of H2O, releasing about 57 kJ per mole.

So 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, but that's more than 11.4. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). So -11.4 kJ is approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but why is there an option with -11.42 kcal? Let me think. Oh, perhaps I confused kJ and kcal.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is about 13.58 kcal (because 57 /4.184 ≈13.58). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 ×13.58 =2.716 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, let me think about the enthalpy of neutralization per mole. Wait, I might have been using the wrong value. Some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids like HCl is about -57 kJ/mol H+ (or H2O produced). For strong bases, same. But for H2SO4, the first H+ is about -57 kJ/mol, the second is about -5 kJ/mol (since it's a weaker acid). So perhaps the diprotic nature affects the calculation.

Wait, so in this case, the moles of H+ neutralized are 0.2, which would include some from H2SO4's first H+.

So let's think: HCl gives 0.1 H+ (strong, 57 kJ/mol each).

H2SO4 gives 0.18 H+ (each first H+ is 57, second is 5 or so).

But in the neutralization, we have 0.2 H+ to neutralize.

The first 0.1 would be the HCl's H+ (as it's a strong acid), each contributing 57 kJ. The next 0.1 would be from H2SO4's first H+ (also strong, 57 kJ each). The remaining 0.08 H+ would be from H2SO4's second H+ (weaker, 5 kJ each).

Wait, but in our case, we only need to neutralize 0.2 H+.

So the first 0.1 is from HCl: 0.1 ×57 =5.7 kJ.

The next 0.1 is from H2SO4's first H+: 0.1 ×57=5.7 kJ.

Total so far: 11.4 kJ.

The remaining H+ is 0.08, which would be from H2SO4's second H+. But since the OH- is 0.2, all of them would have reacted. Wait, no, because the total H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ are neutralized, 0.08 remain.

Wait, but each neutralized H+ gives off heat. So the 0.2 moles of H+ (comprising 0.1 from HCl and 0.1 from first H+ of H2SO4) contribute 0.1 ×57 + 0.1 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

So the total ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, none of the options have -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's odd. Alternatively, perhaps I should include all the H+ from H2SO4?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that all H2SO4 contributes two H+ ions, regardless of strength. So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28, but OH- is 0.2.

So, the neutralization involves 0.2 H+.

But the heat released would be 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and provides two OH- per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides two moles of OH-.

Wait, but that's already been accounted for. The 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 give 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents of H+ = n (H+) = 0.28.

Equivalents of OH- = n (OH-)= 0.2.

The neutralization will proceed until the lower of the two equivalents, which is 0.2.

So, the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, but none of the options match that. Wait, looking again at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm. So option D is -16.0 kJ, but that's higher than 11.4. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base, not per H+. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: when mixing an acid and a base, the neutralization reaction depends on the equivalents.

The formula for enthalpy of neutralization is ΔH = -n × 57 kJ, where n is the moles of H+ neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps it's calculated per mole of reaction.

Wait, another approach: let's write the reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O + H2O?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the reactions would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but let's think about the stoichiometry.

For each mole of Ba(OH)2, it can react with two moles of H+.

Because Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per mole.

So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two H+.

So, in this problem, we have 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction with H+ would be:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, when the Ba(OH)2 is added, it can consume up to 0.2 moles of H+.

Which H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl provides 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles H+.

So, the 0.2 moles OH- will react with 0.1 moles from HCl and 0.1 moles from H2SO4.

Now, the enthalpy change for each H+ neutralized is about -57 kJ per mole. So 0.1 from HCl and 0.1 from H2SO4's first H+ each contribute 57 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is (0.1 +0.1) ×57 =11.4 kJ.

Which is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option D, which is -16.0 kJ, but that's larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculations.

Wait, let me recheck all the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L =0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M ×0.3 L=0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+.

So, the total enthalpy is 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? Maybe the problem considers the enthalpy per mole of acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, if it's -57.2 kcal per mole, then 0.2 moles would be 11.44 kcal, leading to option B being correct.

Wait, wait, let me think about the units.

If the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57.2 kcal per mole of H+, then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 ×57.2 =11.44 kcal. So the ΔH would be -11.44 kcal, which is close to option B's -11.42 kcal.

So perhaps the given value is -57.2 kcal per mole of H+.

Alternatively, the problem might have miscalculated.

Wait, but why would the value be in kcal? Historically, some textbooks use kcal, others use kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the enthalpy of neutralization is -1.0 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, then 0.2 ×1 =0.2 kcal. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of acid and base, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L =0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L =0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 mol.

HCl provides 0.1 H+.

H2SO4, assuming 2 H+ →0.18 H+.

Total H+=0.28.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 OH-.

So, the neutralization uses 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So, the heat is 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but in reality, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ. But 16 kJ is about 3.82 kcal. That doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is different. H2SO4's first dissociation is strong, so it's about -57 kJ per mole. The second is weaker, maybe around -5 kJ per mole.

So in our case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

0.1 comes from HCl (strong, -57 each) → 5.7 kJ.

0.1 comes from H2SO4 first H+ →5.7 kJ.

Total: 11.4 kJ.

But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is 16,000 J.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is diprotic and both H+ are considered, so the total H+ is 0.28, but only 0.2 are neutralized. So, perhaps each H+ gives off 57 kJ.

Wait, but then it's 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization of each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+.

So, perhaps the calculation is 0.28 H+ ×57 kJ =16 kJ. Which would explain option D as -16.0 kJ.

But wait, 0.28 ×57 =15.96 kJ, which is approximately 16 kJ.

So, perhaps the problem considers all the H+ available (0.28) being neutralized, but that's not possible because the OH- is only 0.2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.

The limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 mol). So, the heat released is based on the OH-.

Each OH- reacts with an H+ to form H2O, releasing 57 kJ per mole.

So, 0.2 mol ×57 kJ/mol =11.4 kJ.

So, the ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- and using the minimum, but perhaps the solution is to calculate based on the total of each.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change, regardless of whether all H+ is neutralized or not, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total heat based on all the H+ and OH- present, but that would be incorrect because only 0.2 moles react.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized, but that's not the case because there's only 0.2 OH-.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to restate:

Total H+ available: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) =0.28.

Total OH- available: 0.2.

The reaction uses 0.2 H+.

Each H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ.

So, 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ. So, the answer should be -11.4 kJ. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but among the options given, perhaps the intended answer is option B: -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ in kJ, but seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value, like -57.2 kJ/mol.

0.2 ×57.2=11.44 kJ. Which is approximately -11.44 kJ. But none of the options have that. Option B is in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But that would mean the problem is using 57 kJ per mole as 13.58 kcal per mole, so 0.2 moles would be 2.716 kcal.

So, option A matches that.

But then why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would correspond to 47.3 kJ (11.42 ×4.184 ≈47.3 kJ), which doesn't align.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. Let me think.

HCl is a monoprotic acid, so one mole gives one mole of H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base, giving two OH-.

So, the equivalents calculation:

HCl: 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 eq.

So, the neutralization proceeds until the lower of H+ eq and OH- eq. So 0.2 eq of OH- will neutralize 0.2 eq of H+.

But the enthalpy per mole of acid might be different. Or perhaps the enthalpy is calculated per mole of neutralization regardless of the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total H+ and OH- and taking the sum, but that's not correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the stoichiometry in terms of the acid and base, not just the H+ and OH-.

For example, in the case of HCl and Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

The stoichiometry is 1:1 for HCl to Ba(OH)2, producing 1 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, the reaction is 1:1 between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, producing 2 H2O.

So, let's compute the moles:

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

HCl: 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

So, when Ba(OH)2 is added, it can react with HCl and H2SO4.

First, Ba(OH)2 will react with HCl:

Reaction: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

Moles of HCl: 0.1.

They react in 1:1 ratio, so 0.1 mol each will react, producing 0.1 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change for this: 0.1 ×57 kJ =5.7 kJ.

Then, any remaining Ba(OH)2 will react with H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.1 =0.0 (it's all used up in the first reaction? No, wait, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. HCl is 0.1 mol. So all HCl is neutralized by Ba(OH)2. Now, Ba(OH)2 has 0.1-0.1=0 left. So, the H2SO4 remains.

Wait, no, because Ba(OH)2 can react with H2SO4 in a 1:1 ratio to produce BaSO4 and 2 H2O.

So, H2SO4 is 0.09 mol.

But Ba(OH)2 is 0.1, but 0.1 was used up in reacting with HCl. So no Ba(OH)2 left to react with H2SO4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the total OH- is 0.2, which would have come from 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of equivalents.

HCl: 0.1 equivalents (as it's monoprotic).

H2SO4: 0.18 equivalents (as each mole gives 2 H+).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 equivalents (each mole gives 2 OH-).

So, when they are mixed, the neutralization is as follows:

The equivalents of acid (H+): 0.1 +0.18 =0.28.

Equivalents of base (OH-): 0.2.

The neutralization goes until the lower of the two, which is 0.2.

So, the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ.

So, the total enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close to 0.28 ×57=15.96 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ available, but that would require an excess of OH-.

But in reality, OH- is the limiting reagent, so only 0.2 H+ are neutralized.

So, I'm a bit stuck. But given the options, the only one that aligns with 11.4 kJ is option B, which is -11.42 kcal. But 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, 57 kJ is equal to 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: 57,000 /4,184 ≈13.58 kcal.

So, 0.2 ×13.58 =2.716 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

But why is option B present? It's possible that option B is incorrect, and option A is the correct answer.

So, the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why would the problem give option B as -11.42 kcal? That would correspond to 0.2 ×57.1 kcal, but that's not a standard value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, perhaps per mole of acid instead of per mole of H+.

For example, if HCl has an enthalpy of neutralization of -57.2 kJ/mol (per acid), and H2SO4 is -57.2 kJ/mol as well, but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, so per mole, it's -57.2 ×2 = -114.4 kJ.

But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to calculate the total heat based on the moles of H+ and OH- as I did earlier, leading to 11.4 kJ, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, but that's about 47.3 kJ, which doesn't make sense with the given data.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to sum up.

The correct approach is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from each acid.

HCl: 0.1 mol →0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol →0.18 H+.

Total H+: 0.28.

2. Moles of OH-: Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol →0.2 OH-.

3. Neutralization uses min(0.28,0.2)=0.2 moles.

4. Enthalpy change: 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ →-11.4 kJ.

But no option matches. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is 16,000 J, but that's about 0.28 ×57=15.96, so perhaps the problem expects this approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ from H2SO4, but that would require more OH- than available.

But in any case, I think the correct approach is to use 0.2 moles ×57 kJ →-11.4 kJ. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B as -11.42 kcal, but that would imply a different unit conversion.

Alternatively, the problem might have mixed up kJ and kcal, leading to confusion.

In any case, based on the calculations I've done, the correct ΔH is -11.4 kJ. But since this option isn't present, I must reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating H2SO4 as a diprotic acid but only considering the first H+ as neutralizable. So, H2SO4 contributes 0.09 moles of H+.

HCl contributes 0.1.

Total H+ =0.19.

OH- is 0.2.

So, H+ is 0.19, OH- 0.2. So H+ is the limiting reagent.

Then, the neutralization would use 0.19 moles H+.

Enthalpy change: 0.19 ×57 =10.83 kJ.

Still not matching any options.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the initial approach, the answer is -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option. But perhaps the intended answer is option B, -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ in kcal. But 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, so this doesn't align. Therefore, I'm probably missing something, but I'll proceed with the initial calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, so it contributes \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
     The limiting reactant is the species with the smaller number of moles:  
     \( \text{OH}^- \) is limiting with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization per mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
     For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal if necessary:**  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \),  
   \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This corresponds to approximately \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), which is incorrect because the problem explicitly asks for the enthalpy in kcal.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match any calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as the calculated value is \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), not \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \).

Based on the calculations, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
