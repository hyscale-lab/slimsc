Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds like a titration problem, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach it.

Let me read the problem again. So, we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, ranging from very acidic (like 1.38) to very basic (12.62), with a couple of numbers in between.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions present and see what happens when they react.

Let's break it down. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the HCl will dissociate completely, releasing H+ ions, and the Ba(OH)2 will dissociate completely, releasing OH- ions. Acetic acid won't dissociate completely, but since it's a weak acid, I might have to consider its contribution differently.

Wait, but when mixing all three solutions, the total volume will change. So I should probably calculate the total moles of each acid and base, then account for the dilution.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't donate all the H+ ions, but I'll consider that later.

For HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll donate all H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all OH- will be available.

Now, when mixing HCl (H+ source) and Ba(OH)2 (OH- source), they will neutralize each other. So the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Let me find out how much H+ and OH- I have before neutralization.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, the H+ and OH- will react. Let's see which is in excess.

The total H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So OH- is in excess. The reaction will consume 0.08 moles of OH- and 0.08 moles of H+. So the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but is that all? Because we also have the acetic acid contributing some H+? Or does the strong acid completely neutralized by the strong base?

Wait, no. The acetic acid is a weak acid and will contribute some H+ as well, but since the HCl is a strong acid, its H+ will be neutralized first. So the HCl's H+ will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2, and then any excess OH- will react with the acetic acid.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of all the H+ and OH- in the solution. The initial H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ is fully available. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it'll contribute some H+ but not all. But when you mix everything, the strong acid (HCl) will donate all its H+, and the strong base (Ba(OH)2) will donate all OH-.

So the net H+ and OH- will come from HCl, Ba(OH)2, and any excess from CH3COOH.

Wait, no. Let me approach this step by step.

1. Calculate total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.
2. Calculate total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
3. Subtract H+ and OH- to find the net.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so all H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) is available. The acetic acid can only donate some H+ because it's weak. But when OH- is present, it will react with the strongest acid first, right? That is, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl first, then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from acetic acid.

So, let's see.

Total OH- is 0.18 moles.

The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. So OH- will react with H+ from HCl, neutralizing it. So, 0.08 moles of OH- are consumed, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, this remaining OH- will react with the H+ from acetic acid. But wait, the acetic acid isn't a strong acid, so it won't release all its H+ immediately. So how much H+ does it contribute?

The acetic acid contributes H+ based on its dissociation. But in the presence of excess OH-, which is a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, but wait—acetic acid is a weak acid; it can donate H+ in solution. When OH- is present, it will react with any available H+ (from HCl, then from acetic acid). So after HCl is neutralized, the remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid's H+.

But the problem is, when you mix all these, the OH- will first neutralize the strong acid's H+. Then, if there's any OH- left, it will react with the weak acid.

So, after neutralizing 0.08 moles of OH- with HCl's H+, 0.10 moles of OH- remain. Now, this OH- will react with the acetic acid.

But, the acetic acid is in solution, and the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid, turning it into acetate ions.

So, the acetic acid is CH3COOH, which can donate a H+ to become CH3COO^- and H+. The OH- will take that H+ and become H2O.

So, the OH- will react with the H+ from acetic acid. So how much H+ is available from acetic acid?

The moles of acetic acid are 0.05 moles (from earlier). So in solution, it can donate up to 0.05 moles of H+.

But the OH- is 0.10 moles. So, the OH- can react with the acetic acid's H+.

So, the reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH to produce one mole of CH3COO^-.

So, we have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So, OH- can consume all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

Wait, but OH- is 0.10 moles, so after reacting with all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, how much OH- remains?

0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.

So after all reactions, the net OH- in solution is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but what about the volume? Because all the solutions are mixed together, the total volume is the sum of the individual volumes.

Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is moles / volume = 0.05 / 1.2.

But wait, let me double-check the steps. Because if the OH- is in excess, the solution will be basic, and the pH can be calculated based on the remaining OH- concentration.

So, the net moles of OH- after all possible neutralizations is 0.05.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Now, to find pOH, we take -log10(0.0416667). Let me compute that.

Log(0.0416667) is approximately log(4.16667e-2) which is log(4.1667) + log(1e-2). Log(4.1667) is about 0.619, so log(4.1667e-2) is 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. So, the pOH is 1.381.

Then pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.381 = 12.619, approximately 12.62. So that would correspond to option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I accounted for everything correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So, they neutralize each other, with OH- in excess. Then, the excess OH- is 0.10 moles.

But wait, wait. The OH- is 0.18 moles, H+ is 0.08. Neutralizing each other gives 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Then, that 0.10 moles of OH- reacts with the H+ from acetic acid. But how much H+ can acetic acid provide?

Ah, wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid; it doesn't fully dissociate. So when you add OH- to a weak acid, the OH- will deprotonate the acid, turning it into its conjugate base. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can take one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of CH3COO^-.

So, how much OH- is there after HCl is neutralized? 0.10 moles. How much CH3COOH is present? 0.05 moles.

So, the OH- will react with all of the CH3COOH, consuming 0.05 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

After that, how much OH- remains? 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in a total volume of 1.2 L. So, concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Wait, but what about the acetic acid that's left? After the reaction, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions? Because the OH- is in excess and will deprotonate all the acetic acid.

So, I don't have any free H+ from acetic acid left, because it's all converted to acetate.

So, the solution now has excess OH- of 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So, the OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

Then, the pOH is -log10(0.041667) ≈ 1.381. So, the pH is 14 - 1.381 ≈ 12.619, which is about 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think again about the steps. Did I miss anything?

Wait, another approach: Calculate total H+ and OH- contributions, subtract, and see which is in excess.

Total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH:

HCl: 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH: It's a weak acid, but in the presence of OH-, it'll donate H+. So, perhaps I should think of the H+ from the acetic acid as part of the solution.

Wait, but actually, when you have a solution that's a mixture of strong acid, weak acid, and strong base, the strong acid's H+ will react first with the strong base's OH-.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, OH- is 0.18 moles. They neutralize, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, this OH- will react with whatever H+ is available from the weak acid (CH3COOH). The CH3COOH can contribute H+ based on its dissociation.

Wait, but when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the CH3COOH. So perhaps the OH- will take the H+ from the acetic acid, turning it into acetate.

So, initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. The OH- is 0.10 moles.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

The OH- can take 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, in the solution, you have 0.05 moles of OH- left, and the acetic acid is all converted into acetate.

So, the solution is basic. So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.381, so pH is 14 - 1.381 ≈ 12.619, which rounds to 12.62, so option A is correct.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be A) 12.62.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions and their neutralization reactions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, releasing 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit.  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, and its contribution of H⁺ is initially negligible because it does not fully dissociate. However, any remaining OH⁻ after neutralizing H⁺ from HCl will react with CH₃COOH.

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Neutralization of H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂)**:  
   The strong acid (HCl) donates 0.08 moles of H⁺, and the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) donates 0.18 moles of OH⁻. These react as follows:  
   \[
   \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   After neutralization, 0.18 - 0.08 = **0.10 moles of OH⁻ remain**.

2. **Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻ react with CH₃COOH, which initially has 0.05 moles:  
   \[
   \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   This reaction consumes all 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH, leaving **0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH⁻**.

### Step 3: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log_{10}(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds like a titration problem, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach it.

Let me read the problem again. So, we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, ranging from very acidic (like 1.38) to very basic (12.62), with a couple of numbers in between.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions present and see what happens when they react.

Let's break it down. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the HCl will dissociate completely, releasing H+ ions, and the Ba(OH)2 will dissociate completely, releasing OH- ions. Acetic acid won't dissociate completely, but since it's a weak acid, I might have to consider its contribution differently.

Wait, but when mixing all three solutions, the total volume will change. So I should probably calculate the total moles of each acid and base, then account for the dilution.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't donate all the H+ ions, but I'll consider that later.

For HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll donate all H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all OH- will be available.

Now, when mixing HCl (H+ source) and Ba(OH)2 (OH- source), they will neutralize each other. So the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Let me find out how much H+ and OH- I have before neutralization.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, the H+ and OH- will react. Let's see which is in excess.

The total H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So OH- is in excess. The reaction will consume 0.08 moles of OH- and 0.08 moles of H+. So the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but is that all? Because we also have the acetic acid contributing some H+? Or does the strong acid completely neutralized by the strong base?

Wait, no. The acetic acid is a weak acid and will contribute some H+ as well, but since the HCl is a strong acid, its H+ will be neutralized first. So the HCl's H+ will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2, and then any excess OH- will react with the acetic acid.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of all the H+ and OH- in the solution. The initial H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ is fully available. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it'll contribute some H+ but not all. But when you mix everything, the strong acid (HCl) will donate all its H+, and the strong base (Ba(OH)2) will donate all OH-.

So the net H+ and OH- will come from HCl, Ba(OH)2, and any excess from CH3COOH.

Wait, no. Let me approach this step by step.

1. Calculate total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.
2. Calculate total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
3. Subtract H+ and OH- to find the net.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so all H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) is available. The acetic acid can only donate some H+ because it's weak. But when OH- is present, it will react with the strongest acid first, right? That is, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl first, then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from acetic acid.

So, let's see.

Total OH- is 0.18 moles.

The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. So OH- will react with H+ from HCl, neutralizing it. So, 0.08 moles of OH- are consumed, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, this remaining OH- will react with the H+ from acetic acid. But wait, the acetic acid isn't a strong acid, so it won't release all its H+ immediately. So how much H+ does it contribute?

The acetic acid contributes H+ based on its dissociation. But in the presence of excess OH-, which is a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, but wait—acetic acid is a weak acid; it can donate H+ in solution. When OH- is present, it will react with any available H+ (from HCl, then from acetic acid). So after HCl is neutralized, the remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid's H+.

But the problem is, when you mix all these, the OH- will first neutralize the strong acid's H+. Then, if there's any OH- left, it will react with the weak acid.

So, after neutralizing 0.08 moles of OH- with HCl's H+, 0.10 moles of OH- remain. Now, this OH- will react with the acetic acid.

But, the acetic acid is in solution, and the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid, turning it into acetate ions.

So, the acetic acid is CH3COOH, which can donate a H+ to become CH3COO^- and H+. The OH- will take that H+ and become H2O.

So, the OH- will react with the H+ from acetic acid. So how much H+ is available from acetic acid?

The moles of acetic acid are 0.05 moles (from earlier). So in solution, it can donate up to 0.05 moles of H+.

But the OH- is 0.10 moles. So, the OH- can react with the acetic acid's H+.

So, the reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH to produce one mole of CH3COO^-.

So, we have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

So, OH- can consume all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

Wait, but OH- is 0.10 moles, so after reacting with all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, how much OH- remains?

0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- left.

So after all reactions, the net OH- in solution is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but what about the volume? Because all the solutions are mixed together, the total volume is the sum of the individual volumes.

Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is moles / volume = 0.05 / 1.2.

But wait, let me double-check the steps. Because if the OH- is in excess, the solution will be basic, and the pH can be calculated based on the remaining OH- concentration.

So, the net moles of OH- after all possible neutralizations is 0.05.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Now, to find pOH, we take -log10(0.0416667). Let me compute that.

Log(0.0416667) is approximately log(4.16667e-2) which is log(4.1667) + log(1e-2). Log(4.1667) is about 0.619, so log(4.1667e-2) is 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. So, the pOH is 1.381.

Then pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.381 = 12.619, approximately 12.62. So that would correspond to option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I accounted for everything correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So, they neutralize each other, with OH- in excess. Then, the excess OH- is 0.10 moles.

But wait, wait. The OH- is 0.18 moles, H+ is 0.08. Neutralizing each other gives 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Then, that 0.10 moles of OH- reacts with the H+ from acetic acid. But how much H+ can acetic acid provide?

Ah, wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid; it doesn't fully dissociate. So when you add OH- to a weak acid, the OH- will deprotonate the acid, turning it into its conjugate base. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can take one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of CH3COO^-.

So, how much OH- is there after HCl is neutralized? 0.10 moles. How much CH3COOH is present? 0.05 moles.

So, the OH- will react with all of the CH3COOH, consuming 0.05 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

After that, how much OH- remains? 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in a total volume of 1.2 L. So, concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Wait, but what about the acetic acid that's left? After the reaction, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions? Because the OH- is in excess and will deprotonate all the acetic acid.

So, I don't have any free H+ from acetic acid left, because it's all converted to acetate.

So, the solution now has excess OH- of 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So, the OH- concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

Then, the pOH is -log10(0.041667) ≈ 1.381. So, the pH is 14 - 1.381 ≈ 12.619, which is about 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think again about the steps. Did I miss anything?

Wait, another approach: Calculate total H+ and OH- contributions, subtract, and see which is in excess.

Total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH:

HCl: 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH: It's a weak acid, but in the presence of OH-, it'll donate H+. So, perhaps I should think of the H+ from the acetic acid as part of the solution.

Wait, but actually, when you have a solution that's a mixture of strong acid, weak acid, and strong base, the strong acid's H+ will react first with the strong base's OH-.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, OH- is 0.18 moles. They neutralize, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, this OH- will react with whatever H+ is available from the weak acid (CH3COOH). The CH3COOH can contribute H+ based on its dissociation.

Wait, but when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the CH3COOH. So perhaps the OH- will take the H+ from the acetic acid, turning it into acetate.

So, initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. The OH- is 0.10 moles.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

The OH- can take 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, in the solution, you have 0.05 moles of OH- left, and the acetic acid is all converted into acetate.

So, the solution is basic. So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.381, so pH is 14 - 1.381 ≈ 12.619, which rounds to 12.62, so option A is correct.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions and their neutralization reactions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, releasing 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit.  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, and its contribution of H⁺ is initially negligible because it does not fully dissociate. However, any remaining OH⁻ after neutralizing H⁺ from HCl will react with CH₃COOH.

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Neutralization of H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂)**:  
   The strong acid (HCl) donates 0.08 moles of H⁺, and the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) donates 0.18 moles of OH⁻. These react as follows:  
   \[
   \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   After neutralization, 0.18 - 0.08 = **0.10 moles of OH⁻ remain**.

2. **Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻ react with CH₃COOH, which initially has 0.05 moles:  
   \[
   \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   This reaction consumes all 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH, leaving **0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH⁻**.

### Step 3: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log_{10}(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
