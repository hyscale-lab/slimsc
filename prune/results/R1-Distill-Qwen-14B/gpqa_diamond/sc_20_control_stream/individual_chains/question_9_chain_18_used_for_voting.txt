Okay, so I've got this question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry is a type of molecular symmetry. Let me think. C3h means it has a threefold rotation axis and also a plane of reflection that includes the rotation axis. Or wait, actually, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh right, the h in the point group notation indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h would have a threefold rotation axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis, I think.

Now, the question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two other complex molecules with long names. I need to figure out which one has C3h symmetry.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The name suggests it's a tricyclic compound with three furan rings attached. Hmm, furans are five-membered rings with two double bonds. The numbering looks a bit complicated. I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Maybe if the structure has threefold symmetry, like three identical substituents arranged around a central point.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Another complex name. So it's a molecule with three fused furan rings and a benzene ring? Or maybe it's a benzo-fused system with three furan rings. Not sure. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is CH(CH3)2. So the structure is like a trigonal planar around boron, with each substituent being isopropyl. So the molecule would be symmetric. Let's think about the symmetry. Each of the three substituents is the same, so it's trigonal symmetry. But does it have a plane of reflection? Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, right? Because the boron is in the center with three identical groups. So it has a threefold rotation axis, but does it have a mirror plane? I think it does because each substituent is the same and arranged symmetrically. So maybe it has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h as part of it. Wait, D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h. Hmm, but the question is about C3h specifically. Let me think again: C3h would have a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other planes. Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry because it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So perhaps it has higher symmetry than just C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a norbornane derivative. Its structure has a bridge, making it a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. I think quinuclidine has a threefold axis of symmetry. Wait, no. Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine has a structure where there's a bridge, and the molecule is symmetric across a plane. Wait, maybe it's a C2h symmetry? Or perhaps a different symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it has a threefold axis. Hmm, I'm not too sure. I think quinuclidine has a C2 axis because the structure is symmetric upon 180-degree rotation but not 120. So maybe C2h symmetry, but not C3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each molecule's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: the central boron has three isopropyl groups. Each is the same, so it's symmetric. For symmetry, the molecule will have a threefold rotation axis (C3), and since each substituent is identical and the molecule is flat, there are mirror planes. So it would have D3h symmetry, which includes C3 as well as a horizontal mirror plane (h). So if the molecule has a threefold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it, then it would have C3h symmetry. But wait, D3h is a higher symmetry, including more elements. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between C3h and D3h.

Wait, point groups: C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So a molecule with D3h symmetry would have C3h symmetry as well, but the question is asking which has C3h. So if any of the options have at least C3h, that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about triisopropyl borate. Let me think about the structure again. Boron is sp2 hybridized, so it's trigonal planar. The substituents are isopropyl, which are three identical groups around the boron. So the molecule would have a threefold axis (C3) and three mirror planes. So that would make it D3h symmetry. So D3h includes C3h. So the presence of a horizontal mirror plane would make it C3h, but if it has more mirror planes, it would be D3h.

Wait, another approach: C3h has the following symmetry elements: a threefold rotation axis (C3), and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that includes the C3 axis. So the molecule would have a threefold rotation and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

In triisopropyl borate, the three substituents are identical, so it's symmetric under 120-degree rotations. It also has mirror planes that pass through each substituent and the opposite side. Wait, in a trigonal planar structure, each mirror plane would pass through a substituent and the opposite side (since there's three). So for each mirror plane, there's one passing through each substituent. So that would give three mirror planes. So the symmetry would be D3h, which includes C3h. So if the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry, but some might have higher symmetry, but the presence of C3h is still correct.

Wait, but maybe the question is only looking for the presence of C3h, regardless of higher symmetry. So in that case, triisopropyl borate would certainly have C3h as part of its D3h symmetry.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the other options.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone. Let's think about that structure. It's a fused ring system. If it has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, maybe around a central point, then it could have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's more complicated.

Option B: benzo...trifuran...hexaone. Similar idea but perhaps a different arrangement. If the substituents are arranged in a way that allows a threefold rotation and a mirror plane, it might have C3h.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tough. However, triisopropyl borate is a well-known molecule. Its structure is symmetric, with three identical groups arranged around a central atom.

So, going back, triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So it must have C3h symmetry. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) triphenyleno... etc.

B) benzo... etc.

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine.

So the options are labeled A, B, C, D. The question is which has C3h symmetry.

So if option C is triisopropyl borate, which has D3h symmetry, and thus includes C3h, then it's correct.

Alternatively, are there any other molecules in the options with C3h symmetry?

Looking at option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic system. I think it has a threefold axis. Wait, no. Quinuclidine has a structure that's bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, which is a norbornane structure. Let me visualize it: two bridgehead carbons connected by two bridges. It's a seven-membered ring, but two of the bridges are two carbons, and the other is one. I think the molecule has a threefold rotation axis. Wait, perhaps. Let me imagine: if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around an axis that goes through the bridgehead carbons, would it look the same? Hmm, maybe not. Because the structure is more complex. Alternatively, maybe it's a C2 axis.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3 axis. I'm not sure. Let me think about the molecule. Quinuclidine has a structure where there's a central bridge, and substituents arranged around it. But I think the molecule is symmetric under a 120-degree rotation. So perhaps it has C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If so, then it would have C3h.

Alternatively, maybe it has a C2 axis and inversion, making it C2h, but not C3h.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, so it has a high degree of symmetry. So it must have C3h symmetry because it has a threefold rotation and a mirror plane.

The other options: the two hexaones are more complex, but I don't know their structures well. Triphenyleno...trifuran... maybe has a central point with three substituents, but I'm not certain. Quinuclidine I'm less sure about.

So the most confident answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, which has C3h symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C₃ axis.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a complex tricyclic system with three fused furan rings and a triphenylene group. While it may have some symmetry due to the arrangement of the fused rings, the exact symmetry elements (C₃ and σh) are unclear without a detailed structural analysis. This option is less likely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a fused system with a benzene ring and three furan rings. The symmetry depends on the arrangement of the fused rings, but it is unlikely to have a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). This option does not appear to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, with a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and three mirror planes. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C₃ axis. This makes it a **D₃h** molecule, which includes **C₃h** symmetry as a subset. Therefore, this molecule definitely has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. It has a threefold rotation axis (C₃) but lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Instead, it has a plane of symmetry that is not horizontal, meaning it does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that has **C₃h** symmetry. While it actually has **D₃h** symmetry (a higher symmetry group), it satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry as a subset of its overall symmetry.

**Answer: C**
