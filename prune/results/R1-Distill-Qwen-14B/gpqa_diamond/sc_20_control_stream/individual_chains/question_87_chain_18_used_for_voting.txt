Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted usually means two substituents on the ring. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. So, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, so it's benzene with two substituents. Let's add up the carbons: benzene has 6, each substituent adds some. So two substituents plus six equals 8. So each substituent must add a total of 2 carbons. Wait, because 6 + 2 = 8. Hmm, maybe each substituent is one carbon, but that's two substituents, adding two carbons. Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that doesn't make sense because di-substituted implies two substituents. So maybe each substituent is a methyl group? Wait, no, methyl is one carbon. So maybe each substituent is a methylene group (–CH₂–) but that would add two carbons each, making 6 + 4 = 10, which is too much. Wait, maybe one substituent is –CO– and another is –X (like chlorine). Let me think.

Wait, the FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl and a halogen on the aromatic ring. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, so the substituents on the benzene are –CO–something and –X (like Cl, Br, etc.). Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So each substituent must be a single carbon. So maybe one substituent is –COOH (but that would add two carbons for the COOH group, but wait, the substituent is connected directly. Wait, no. COOH is a substituent where the benzene is attached to a carbonyl group which is attached to an –OH. That's two substituents: wait, no, the substituent is –COOH, which is one substituent, but that adds two carbons beyond the benzene. So if benzene has 6 carbons, and the substituent is –COOH, which is two carbons (the COO part, but actually, it's more like the substituent is –COOH, so the benzene is connected to a carbonyl and then an OH. Wait, no. The substituent would be –COOH which is a group where benzene is attached to a carbonyl oxygen, which is attached to an O–H. But benzene can't have an O directly attached unless it's in a ring; perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the substituents are each one carbon. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a ketone group (like –CO–R) but wait, R would be another carbon. Hmm, maybe it's an acetyl group. For example, if one substituent is an acetyl group (–COCH3), that adds two carbons (the CO and the CH3). But wait, that would make the substituent two carbons. So if benzene is 6, then substituent with two carbons would make 8? No, because if the substituent is –COCH3, that's two carbons (the C of CO and the CH3), but the benzene is 6, so substituents would add 2, making total 8. So two substituents, each adding one carbon? No, that's not possible because each substituent would have to be a single carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like –CO–) and a halogen atom. But a halogen is just one substituent, a single atom. So if benzene has two substituents, one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, but that would require another carbon attached to the ring. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with another substituent, but that would be only one substituent. Hmm, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. But that would require two substituents, each on the ring. So for example, benzene with a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which would be R-C=O) attached, but wait, that would require another carbon attached. For example, if the substituent is –CO–, but that's not possible; more accurately, the substituent would be –CO–R where R is another group. So perhaps the substituent is –CO–R, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like para-substituted. Let me think about the substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. The other substituent is a halogen atom. But wait, the problem says the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. So each substituent is a group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the total number of carbons is 8. So benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents. Each substituent must add one carbon because 6 + 2 =8. So substituents are each a single carbon plus any attached atoms. Wait, but a halogen is an atom, not a carbon. So one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.) which doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent must be something that adds two carbons, because 6 + 2 =8.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach it again. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. So the benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents equals 8. So substituents add 2 carbons in total. So each substituent can add one carbon each. So substituents could be a –CO– group (which is a carbonyl) and a –X (halogen). Wait, but –CO– is not a substituent by itself; it's part of a larger group.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon, like an acetyl group (–COCH3). That would add two carbons (the C of CO and the CH3), making the total carbons 6 (benzene) + 2 =8. But since it's di-substituted, the other substituent must be a halogen, which is one substituent but no additional carbons. So in that case, the substituents would be –COCH3 and –X (like Cl). Wait, but then the total substituents add three carbons (the COCH3 is two carbons, and the Cl is none). So benzene has 6, substituents add 2 (from COCH3) and 0 (Cl), so total is 8 carbons. Yes, that makes sense.

So the structure would be benzene with one substituent as acetyl (COCH3) and another as Cl (for example). So the two substituents are in positions on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the di-substituted aromatic ring could have the substituents in para, meta, or ortho positions. But for NMR, their positions affect the splitting and the chemical shifts.

Now, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (so a C=O stretch around ~1700 cm⁻¹) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Halogens on aromatic rings typically show a stretch around 600-700 cm⁻¹ for C–X bonds. So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the options for the 1H NMR spectrum.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

So, the compound has a carbonyl group (so maybe it's an aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.). Let's consider if it's an acetyl group (-COCH3). The CH3 group in an acetyl would show up around δ 2.1-2.6 as a singlet. But looking at the options, option C has a 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H. That could be a CH3 attached to a carbonyl, like an acetyl group. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So in option A, there's a 9.9 ppm singlet for 1H, which would suggest an aldehyde proton.

So, for the substituents, let's say one is an aldehyde (–CHO) and the other is a halogen, say –Cl. Then the aromatic ring would have an aldehyde group and Cl, making the structure something like o-, m-, or p-chlorobenzaldehyde.

Alternatively, if one substituent is –COCH3 (acetyl) and the other is –Cl, then the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 around 2.3 ppm if it's para, maybe as a singlet. But wait, in the acetyl group, the CH3 is next to the carbonyl, so it's usually a triplet? No, wait, the CH3 in acetyl is a singlet because the three protons are equivalent and there's no neighboring non-equivalent protons that would cause splitting.

So, in option C, we have a triplet at 2.3 ppm for 3H as a singlet. That would fit an acetyl group.

Wait, but the substituents are di-substituted, so their positions (ortho, meta, para) would affect the aromatic protons and their splitting.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR data. Let's suppose the structure is para-acetylchlorobenzene. So the substituents are –COCH3 and –Cl in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets if substituents are para. Because in para substitution, the ring has two equivalent H on each of the two adjacent carbons. So their NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches option C's 7.8 (d, 2H) and 7.6 (d, 2H). Alternatively, if substituents are in ortho positions, the aromatic protons might show more splitting, but para would give two doublets.

So in option C, the aromatic region has 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each as doublets, integrating to 2H each. That would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (like –COCH3 and –Cl) in opposite positions, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, but the aromatic protons in para substitution would be in pairs. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps each substituent is in the para position to each other. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 3, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, meaning they are opposite each other, leading to symmetry.

Wait, another approach: The NMR data in option C shows two doublets in the aromatic region. That suggests a disubstituted benzene with two substituents in positions that create two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two pairs of equivalent protons, each as doublets. So that matches the data in option C.

Additionally, the 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H would correspond to the methyl group in the acetyl (COCH3) group. So the structure would be para-chloroacetophenone, perhaps.

But wait, the FTIR indicates a carbonyl group. So the presence of a carbonyl is confirmed, which would be present in both aldehyde and ketone structures. So the carbonyl could be from an acetyl group (as in option C) or from an aldehyde group (as in option A).

Let me think again about each option:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) → could be an aldehyde proton. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, indicating para substitution. Also, a singlet at 3.7 ppm for 2H, which might suggest a CH2 group, but I'm not sure. Wait, but if the substituent is an aldehyde (CHO), that would be one substituent, and the other substituent is a halogen, say Cl. So the substituents are para, leading to two doublets in aromatic region.

So in option A: The aromatic protons are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The 9.9 ppm is the aldehyde proton, and 3.7 (2H, s) could be something else, perhaps a methylene group. But wait, where would a methylene group come from? Unless the substituent is not just Cl and CHO. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetal or something else.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6. So substituents add 2. So if substituents are –CHO (which is one substituent, one carbon) and –Cl (another substituent, zero carbons), that only adds one carbon, making benzene 6 +1=7, which is less than 8. So that's a problem. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –COOH? That would be two substituents? No, because COOH is one group. So if the substituent is –COOH, that's two carbons (the COO part). But wait, that's attached directly to the benzene. So benzene has 6, substituent (–COOH) adds 2, making 8. But then where is the halogen? Oh wait, then the other substituent would have to be a halogen, but that would require two substituents. So in that case, the structure would be something like benzene with a –COOH group and a –X (Cl, etc.) group. But wait, that would add 6 (benzene) +2 (COOH) +0 (Cl) =8. But the substituents would be two: –COOH and –Cl. So the substituents are two, making it di-substituted.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern, and the NMR would show the COOH protons, but wait, in the options, the NMR doesn't show any broad peak around 2-3 ppm for an –OH group. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are –COCH3 (acetyl) and –X (Cl). That would add two substituents, each adding one and zero carbons, but wait, the acetyl adds two carbons (the CO and the CH3). So 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) + 0 (Cl) =8. So yes, that fits.

So, in that case, the structure would be benzene with a Cl and an acetyl group attached. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (if in para positions), the acetyl CH3 as a singlet, and perhaps other groups.

So looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That fits the para-substituted acetyl and Cl. The aromatic protons are two sets of doublets, indicating a para substitution, and the CH3 is a singlet. So option C seems to fit.

But wait, let's look again. Another option is option A, which has a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton. If the substituent is an aldehyde, then the other substituent must be a halogen. But as I thought earlier, that would make the total carbons 6 +1 (aldehyde) + substituent (Cl) =7, which is less than 8. So that's not possible. So option A can't be correct because the total carbons would be 7, but the question says 8.

Wait, but maybe the substituent is not just an aldehyde. Maybe it's an acetaldehyde group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acyl group with more carbons. Hmm, perhaps not. I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about another approach. The di-substituted aromatic ring has 8 carbons. So substituents add 2. So substituents are either two groups each with one carbon, but one of them being a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: One substituent is a –CHO (aldehyde) which adds one carbon, and the other substituent is a –CO– group. But wait, a –CO– group by itself isn't possible; it needs to be connected to something. For example, a ketone substituent would have –CO–R, where R is another carbon. Wait, but if R is a methyl, that would be –COCH3, which adds two carbons. So substituents would be –CHO (1 C) and –COCH3 (2 C), which adds 3 C, making the total 6 +3 =9, which is too much. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a –COOH group, which adds two carbons, and the other substituent is a –Cl, adding none. So 6 +2 =8. That works. So the substituents are –COOH and –Cl.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. But in the case of –COOH, the –OH would show up as a broad peak, but in the options, I don't see any broad signals, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. So that's likely a CH3 attached to something. If the substituent is –COCH3, that would fit. So the other substituent is –Cl. That would make the NMR as in option C.

So, the structure is para-substituted benzene with acetyl and Cl groups. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The acetyl's CH3 would be a singlet. So option C matches this.

Alternatively, if the substituent is an aldehyde and something else, but that doesn't fit the carbon count.

Wait, what about option D? It has a singlet at 6.9 ppm for 1H. That could be an aromatic proton with no adjacent protons, perhaps in the case of a meta substitution? Or maybe it's a substituent like –OCH3, but that's not relevant here. Option D also has two doublets (4.8 and 4.6 ppm) which don't fit aromatic protons. Those are more like protons attached to oxygen, like in an ether or something. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option B has protons around 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which could be adjacent to an oxygen, like in an –OCH2CH2O– structure, but I don't see how that fits with the aromatic substituents.

So, going back, option C seems to fit the scenario where the substituents are –COCH3 (acetyl) and –Cl in a para arrangement, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl group. But wait, then the FTIR would show the carbonyl from the acetyl group, which it does, and the C–Cl bond, which is present. So that all fits.

Wait, but another possibility is if the substituent is a ketone, like a benzophenone structure, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are –CO–O–R, but that would complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyano group (–CN), but that doesn't add any carbons. So that wouldn't help with the carbon count.

Wait, another thought: If the substituent is a –CH2– group attached to a carbonyl, but that would add more carbons than needed.

Another approach: the presence of a carbonyl group in the compound would lead to specific peaks in the NMR. For example, an aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, a ketone would not have a proton attached to the carbonyl, so no peak in that region. An ester would have a carbonyl but no aldehyde proton. So in option A, the 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde proton. But as earlier analysis, that would require substituents adding only one carbon (from the aldehyde), making the total 7 carbons, which doesn't fit the problem statement.

Wait, wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CO–O–R group, but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CO–CH2–X group, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CO– group, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: The aldehyde proton suggests a substituent with a CHO group. But as per the carbon count, that would require another substituent adding one carbon. Wait, but the total substituents must add two carbons. So if one substituent is CHO (1 C), the other must be a substituent adding one C, which must be a carbonyl group. But a carbonyl group (like CO) by itself isn't possible; it's part of a larger group. So perhaps the other substituent is a –CO– group attached to another carbon. But I think I'm getting stuck here.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C. It fits with the structure of para-acetylchlorobenzene, which has substituents adding two carbons (COCH3) and a halogen. The NMR data in option C would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (7.8 and 7.6 ppm), the acetyl CH3 as a singlet at 2.3 ppm. So that seems to fit.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Option D has a 6.9 ppm singlet, which is more like an aromatic proton that's isolated, perhaps in a meta substitution. The other peaks in D are around 4.8 and 4.6, which might be from an –OCH2– group, but that doesn't fit with the substituents we're considering.

So, to recap, the compound is di-substituted benzene with substituents –COCH3 and –Cl (para). The NMR would have two doublets in aromatic region, and a singlet for the CH3. So option C matches.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (C=O), and the other is a halogen (X). The total carbon count is 8, meaning the substituents add 2 carbons to the benzene ring. This suggests one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group (e.g., –COCH₃, an acetyl group), and the other is a halogen (e.g., Cl). 

The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The ¹H NMR data must reflect the structure of para-substituted benzene with –COCH₃ and –Cl groups. In this case, the aromatic protons would appear as two doublets (2H each) due to the symmetry of the para substitution. The methyl group of the acetyl substituent would appear as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Contains a singlet at 9.9 ppm, indicative of an aldehyde proton. However, an aldehyde substituent would only add 1 carbon, leaving no room for the second substituent to satisfy the 8-carbon total. This option is inconsistent with the carbon count.
- **Option B**: Shows peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of protons adjacent to oxygen (e.g., in an ether or alcohol). This does not align with the expected structure of the compound.
- **Option C**: Contains two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, 2H each), consistent with a para-substituted benzene. A singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. This matches the expected structure.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which could represent an isolated aromatic proton, and peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, again indicative of protons near oxygen. This does not fit the expected structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is para-substituted benzene with –COCH₃ and –Cl groups. The NMR data in **Option C** aligns with this structure, showing two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted usually means two substituents on the ring. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. So, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, so it's benzene with two substituents. Let's add up the carbons: benzene has 6, each substituent adds some. So two substituents plus six equals 8. So each substituent must add a total of 2 carbons. Wait, because 6 + 2 = 8. Hmm, maybe each substituent is one carbon, but that's two substituents, adding two carbons. Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that doesn't make sense because di-substituted implies two substituents. So maybe each substituent is a methyl group? Wait, no, methyl is one carbon. So maybe each substituent is a methylene group (–CH₂–) but that would add two carbons each, making 6 + 4 = 10, which is too much. Wait, maybe one substituent is –CO– and another is –X (like chlorine). Let me think.

Wait, the FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl and a halogen on the aromatic ring. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, so the substituents on the benzene are –CO–something and –X (like Cl, Br, etc.). Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So each substituent must be a single carbon. So maybe one substituent is –COOH (but that would add two carbons for the COOH group, but wait, the substituent is connected directly. Wait, no. COOH is a substituent where the benzene is attached to a carbonyl group which is attached to an –OH. That's two substituents: wait, no, the substituent is –COOH, which is one substituent, but that adds two carbons beyond the benzene. So if benzene has 6 carbons, and the substituent is –COOH, which is two carbons (the COO part, but actually, it's more like the substituent is –COOH, so the benzene is connected to a carbonyl and then an OH. Wait, no. The substituent would be –COOH which is a group where benzene is attached to a carbonyl oxygen, which is attached to an O–H. But benzene can't have an O directly attached unless it's in a ring; perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the substituents are each one carbon. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a ketone group (like –CO–R) but wait, R would be another carbon. Hmm, maybe it's an acetyl group. For example, if one substituent is an acetyl group (–COCH3), that adds two carbons (the CO and the CH3). But wait, that would make the substituent two carbons. So if benzene is 6, then substituent with two carbons would make 8? No, because if the substituent is –COCH3, that's two carbons (the C of CO and the CH3), but the benzene is 6, so substituents would add 2, making total 8. So two substituents, each adding one carbon? No, that's not possible because each substituent would have to be a single carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like –CO–) and a halogen atom. But a halogen is just one substituent, a single atom. So if benzene has two substituents, one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, but that would require another carbon attached to the ring. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with another substituent, but that would be only one substituent. Hmm, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. But that would require two substituents, each on the ring. So for example, benzene with a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which would be R-C=O) attached, but wait, that would require another carbon attached. For example, if the substituent is –CO–, but that's not possible; more accurately, the substituent would be –CO–R where R is another group. So perhaps the substituent is –CO–R, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like para-substituted. Let me think about the substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. The other substituent is a halogen atom. But wait, the problem says the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. So each substituent is a group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the total number of carbons is 8. So benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents. Each substituent must add one carbon because 6 + 2 =8. So substituents are each a single carbon plus any attached atoms. Wait, but a halogen is an atom, not a carbon. So one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.) which doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent must be something that adds two carbons, because 6 + 2 =8.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach it again. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. So the benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents equals 8. So substituents add 2 carbons in total. So each substituent can add one carbon each. So substituents could be a –CO– group (which is a carbonyl) and a –X (halogen). Wait, but –CO– is not a substituent by itself; it's part of a larger group.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon, like an acetyl group (–COCH3). That would add two carbons (the C of CO and the CH3), making the total carbons 6 (benzene) + 2 =8. But since it's di-substituted, the other substituent must be a halogen, which is one substituent but no additional carbons. So in that case, the substituents would be –COCH3 and –X (like Cl). Wait, but then the total substituents add three carbons (the COCH3 is two carbons, and the Cl is none). So benzene has 6, substituents add 2 (from COCH3) and 0 (Cl), so total is 8 carbons. Yes, that makes sense.

So the structure would be benzene with one substituent as acetyl (COCH3) and another as Cl (for example). So the two substituents are in positions on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the di-substituted aromatic ring could have the substituents in para, meta, or ortho positions. But for NMR, their positions affect the splitting and the chemical shifts.

Now, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (so a C=O stretch around ~1700 cm⁻¹) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Halogens on aromatic rings typically show a stretch around 600-700 cm⁻¹ for C–X bonds. So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the options for the 1H NMR spectrum.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

So, the compound has a carbonyl group (so maybe it's an aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.). Let's consider if it's an acetyl group (-COCH3). The CH3 group in an acetyl would show up around δ 2.1-2.6 as a singlet. But looking at the options, option C has a 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H. That could be a CH3 attached to a carbonyl, like an acetyl group. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So in option A, there's a 9.9 ppm singlet for 1H, which would suggest an aldehyde proton.

So, for the substituents, let's say one is an aldehyde (–CHO) and the other is a halogen, say –Cl. Then the aromatic ring would have an aldehyde group and Cl, making the structure something like o-, m-, or p-chlorobenzaldehyde.

Alternatively, if one substituent is –COCH3 (acetyl) and the other is –Cl, then the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 around 2.3 ppm if it's para, maybe as a singlet. But wait, in the acetyl group, the CH3 is next to the carbonyl, so it's usually a triplet? No, wait, the CH3 in acetyl is a singlet because the three protons are equivalent and there's no neighboring non-equivalent protons that would cause splitting.

So, in option C, we have a triplet at 2.3 ppm for 3H as a singlet. That would fit an acetyl group.

Wait, but the substituents are di-substituted, so their positions (ortho, meta, para) would affect the aromatic protons and their splitting.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR data. Let's suppose the structure is para-acetylchlorobenzene. So the substituents are –COCH3 and –Cl in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets if substituents are para. Because in para substitution, the ring has two equivalent H on each of the two adjacent carbons. So their NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches option C's 7.8 (d, 2H) and 7.6 (d, 2H). Alternatively, if substituents are in ortho positions, the aromatic protons might show more splitting, but para would give two doublets.

So in option C, the aromatic region has 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each as doublets, integrating to 2H each. That would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents (like –COCH3 and –Cl) in opposite positions, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, but the aromatic protons in para substitution would be in pairs. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps each substituent is in the para position to each other. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 3, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, meaning they are opposite each other, leading to symmetry.

Wait, another approach: The NMR data in option C shows two doublets in the aromatic region. That suggests a disubstituted benzene with two substituents in positions that create two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two pairs of equivalent protons, each as doublets. So that matches the data in option C.

Additionally, the 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H would correspond to the methyl group in the acetyl (COCH3) group. So the structure would be para-chloroacetophenone, perhaps.

But wait, the FTIR indicates a carbonyl group. So the presence of a carbonyl is confirmed, which would be present in both aldehyde and ketone structures. So the carbonyl could be from an acetyl group (as in option C) or from an aldehyde group (as in option A).

Let me think again about each option:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) → could be an aldehyde proton. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, indicating para substitution. Also, a singlet at 3.7 ppm for 2H, which might suggest a CH2 group, but I'm not sure. Wait, but if the substituent is an aldehyde (CHO), that would be one substituent, and the other substituent is a halogen, say Cl. So the substituents are para, leading to two doublets in aromatic region.

So in option A: The aromatic protons are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The 9.9 ppm is the aldehyde proton, and 3.7 (2H, s) could be something else, perhaps a methylene group. But wait, where would a methylene group come from? Unless the substituent is not just Cl and CHO. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetal or something else.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6. So substituents add 2. So if substituents are –CHO (which is one substituent, one carbon) and –Cl (another substituent, zero carbons), that only adds one carbon, making benzene 6 +1=7, which is less than 8. So that's a problem. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –COOH? That would be two substituents? No, because COOH is one group. So if the substituent is –COOH, that's two carbons (the COO part). But wait, that's attached directly to the benzene. So benzene has 6, substituent (–COOH) adds 2, making 8. But then where is the halogen? Oh wait, then the other substituent would have to be a halogen, but that would require two substituents. So in that case, the structure would be something like benzene with a –COOH group and a –X (Cl, etc.) group. But wait, that would add 6 (benzene) +2 (COOH) +0 (Cl) =8. But the substituents would be two: –COOH and –Cl. So the substituents are two, making it di-substituted.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern, and the NMR would show the COOH protons, but wait, in the options, the NMR doesn't show any broad peak around 2-3 ppm for an –OH group. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are –COCH3 (acetyl) and –X (Cl). That would add two substituents, each adding one and zero carbons, but wait, the acetyl adds two carbons (the CO and the CH3). So 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) + 0 (Cl) =8. So yes, that fits.

So, in that case, the structure would be benzene with a Cl and an acetyl group attached. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (if in para positions), the acetyl CH3 as a singlet, and perhaps other groups.

So looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That fits the para-substituted acetyl and Cl. The aromatic protons are two sets of doublets, indicating a para substitution, and the CH3 is a singlet. So option C seems to fit.

But wait, let's look again. Another option is option A, which has a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton. If the substituent is an aldehyde, then the other substituent must be a halogen. But as I thought earlier, that would make the total carbons 6 +1 (aldehyde) + substituent (Cl) =7, which is less than 8. So that's not possible. So option A can't be correct because the total carbons would be 7, but the question says 8.

Wait, but maybe the substituent is not just an aldehyde. Maybe it's an acetaldehyde group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acyl group with more carbons. Hmm, perhaps not. I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about another approach. The di-substituted aromatic ring has 8 carbons. So substituents add 2. So substituents are either two groups each with one carbon, but one of them being a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: One substituent is a –CHO (aldehyde) which adds one carbon, and the other substituent is a –CO– group. But wait, a –CO– group by itself isn't possible; it needs to be connected to something. For example, a ketone substituent would have –CO–R, where R is another carbon. Wait, but if R is a methyl, that would be –COCH3, which adds two carbons. So substituents would be –CHO (1 C) and –COCH3 (2 C), which adds 3 C, making the total 6 +3 =9, which is too much. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a –COOH group, which adds two carbons, and the other substituent is a –Cl, adding none. So 6 +2 =8. That works. So the substituents are –COOH and –Cl.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. But in the case of –COOH, the –OH would show up as a broad peak, but in the options, I don't see any broad signals, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. So that's likely a CH3 attached to something. If the substituent is –COCH3, that would fit. So the other substituent is –Cl. That would make the NMR as in option C.

So, the structure is para-substituted benzene with acetyl and Cl groups. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets. The acetyl's CH3 would be a singlet. So option C matches this.

Alternatively, if the substituent is an aldehyde and something else, but that doesn't fit the carbon count.

Wait, what about option D? It has a singlet at 6.9 ppm for 1H. That could be an aromatic proton with no adjacent protons, perhaps in the case of a meta substitution? Or maybe it's a substituent like –OCH3, but that's not relevant here. Option D also has two doublets (4.8 and 4.6 ppm) which don't fit aromatic protons. Those are more like protons attached to oxygen, like in an ether or something. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option B has protons around 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which could be adjacent to an oxygen, like in an –OCH2CH2O– structure, but I don't see how that fits with the aromatic substituents.

So, going back, option C seems to fit the scenario where the substituents are –COCH3 (acetyl) and –Cl in a para arrangement, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the methyl group. But wait, then the FTIR would show the carbonyl from the acetyl group, which it does, and the C–Cl bond, which is present. So that all fits.

Wait, but another possibility is if the substituent is a ketone, like a benzophenone structure, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are –CO–O–R, but that would complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyano group (–CN), but that doesn't add any carbons. So that wouldn't help with the carbon count.

Wait, another thought: If the substituent is a –CH2– group attached to a carbonyl, but that would add more carbons than needed.

Another approach: the presence of a carbonyl group in the compound would lead to specific peaks in the NMR. For example, an aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, a ketone would not have a proton attached to the carbonyl, so no peak in that region. An ester would have a carbonyl but no aldehyde proton. So in option A, the 9.9 ppm indicates an aldehyde proton. But as earlier analysis, that would require substituents adding only one carbon (from the aldehyde), making the total 7 carbons, which doesn't fit the problem statement.

Wait, wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CO–O–R group, but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CO–CH2–X group, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CO– group, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: The aldehyde proton suggests a substituent with a CHO group. But as per the carbon count, that would require another substituent adding one carbon. Wait, but the total substituents must add two carbons. So if one substituent is CHO (1 C), the other must be a substituent adding one C, which must be a carbonyl group. But a carbonyl group (like CO) by itself isn't possible; it's part of a larger group. So perhaps the other substituent is a –CO– group attached to another carbon. But I think I'm getting stuck here.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C. It fits with the structure of para-acetylchlorobenzene, which has substituents adding two carbons (COCH3) and a halogen. The NMR data in option C would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (7.8 and 7.6 ppm), the acetyl CH3 as a singlet at 2.3 ppm. So that seems to fit.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Option D has a 6.9 ppm singlet, which is more like an aromatic proton that's isolated, perhaps in a meta substitution. The other peaks in D are around 4.8 and 4.6, which might be from an –OCH2– group, but that doesn't fit with the substituents we're considering.

So, to recap, the compound is di-substituted benzene with substituents –COCH3 and –Cl (para). The NMR would have two doublets in aromatic region, and a singlet for the CH3. So option C matches.

So the correct answer would be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (C=O), and the other is a halogen (X). The total carbon count is 8, meaning the substituents add 2 carbons to the benzene ring. This suggests one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group (e.g., –COCH₃, an acetyl group), and the other is a halogen (e.g., Cl). 

The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The ¹H NMR data must reflect the structure of para-substituted benzene with –COCH₃ and –Cl groups. In this case, the aromatic protons would appear as two doublets (2H each) due to the symmetry of the para substitution. The methyl group of the acetyl substituent would appear as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Contains a singlet at 9.9 ppm, indicative of an aldehyde proton. However, an aldehyde substituent would only add 1 carbon, leaving no room for the second substituent to satisfy the 8-carbon total. This option is inconsistent with the carbon count.
- **Option B**: Shows peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of protons adjacent to oxygen (e.g., in an ether or alcohol). This does not align with the expected structure of the compound.
- **Option C**: Contains two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, 2H each), consistent with a para-substituted benzene. A singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. This matches the expected structure.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which could represent an isolated aromatic proton, and peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, again indicative of protons near oxygen. This does not fit the expected structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is para-substituted benzene with –COCH₃ and –Cl groups. The NMR data in **Option C** aligns with this structure, showing two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.
