Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum mechanics and molecules. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state. The next state with the lowest energy would be the first excited state. But wait, what's the model here? Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor model considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

In the quantum rotation model, the energy levels are quantized. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But wait, the non-rigid rotor model might have a bit more complexity, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying it to a rigid rotor since it's giving me a vibrational frequency.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational states. Oh, but the molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. So for a diatomic, the ground state is typically the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0).

Wait, but when it absorbs a photon, it needs to transition to the next state. But what's the 'next' state in terms of quantum numbers? Well, the molecule could either increase its rotational state or its vibrational state. But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's the next higher state in terms of energy, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

But wait, in the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. The total energy would be E_total = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1 (vibrational first excited) or J=1 (rotational first excited). But which transition requires less energy? Because we need the photon that switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy, so perhaps the one with the smallest energy difference.

Wait, the problem says the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the smallest energy increase possible. So the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the one with the least energy above that. So maybe the rotational transition to J=1 would be lower energy than the vibrational transition to v=1. Or perhaps the opposite.

I need to calculate the energy required for both transitions and see which is smaller.

First, let's find the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the ground state is v=0: E0 = (1/2) h w. The first excited vibrational state is v=1: E1 = (3/2) h w. So the energy difference ΔE_vib = E1 - E0 = h w.

Next, the rotational energy difference. For a rigid rotor, E_rot = B J (J +1), where B is the rotational constant given by h/(8 π² I c), but wait, more accurately, B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), or maybe I should look up the formula. Alternatively, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I: B = h/(8 π² I). Oh wait, no, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (h²/(8 π² I) ) * 2 ] - 0 = 2 (h²/(8 π² I)) ) = h²/(4 π² I).

So I need to compute both ΔE_vib = h w and ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² I).

Which one is smaller? Let's compute both.

But wait, what are the given values? Let me check:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. Molecular bond length R = 2 angstroms. Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s.

First, compute I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) )

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx + My is 22 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert this into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 is approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, let me be precise:

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.6605 = about 3. (1.8 *1.6 is 2.88, 1.8*0.0605 is ~0.1089, total 2.9889). So approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, but 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg.

Wait, no: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So total μ is (20 *2)/(22) amu = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu. So 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So R² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now compute ΔE_rot, which is h²/(4 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

4 π² is about 39.478.

So denominator is 4 π² I ≈ 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ let's compute that.

39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.65e-46 ≈ 4.765e-45.

Wait, 39.478 * 1.2064 is approx 39.478*1.2=47.37, 39.478*0.0064=0.252, so total 47.622. So 47.622e-46 = 4.7622e-45.

So ΔE_rot ≈ (4.39e-67) / (4.7622e-45) ) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² I) = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (4 * (pi)^2 * 1.2064e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 * pi^2 ≈ 39.478. Multiply by I (1.2064e-46): 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.65e-46 = 4.765e-45.

So 4.39e-67 / 4.765e-45 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm. Now the vibrational energy is ΔE_vib = h * w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two: 9.21e-23 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would be absorbed to cause a rotational transition, not a vibrational one.

Wait, but the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So the next state in energy would be the one with the smallest possible increase. So the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next state could be either v=1 (ΔE=2.65e-19 J) or J=1 (ΔE=9.21e-23 J). So the smallest ΔE is the rotational one. So the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. Are the rotational and vibrational states quantized separately? So the total energy is the sum of both. So in the ground state, both v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1 and J=0, or v=0 and J=1, whichever has the lower energy.

So which has lower energy? The J=1 transition requires about 9e-23 J, which is much less than 2.6e-19 J. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But the question is about momentum, not energy. So how do we find the momentum p from the energy?

Energy of a photon is E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

E is 9.21e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Wait, 1 Ns is kg m/s. So 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns, which is 0.3e-30 Ns. But the options are much larger: 1.9e-28 Ns is bigger than that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I got the energy wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Did I compute the rotational energy correctly?

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by h / (8 π² I), correct?

So B = h/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 * (pi^2) * 1.2064e-46 kg m² )

Let me compute the denominator: 8 pi^2 is approximately 78.956. Multiply by I (1.2064e-46): 78.956 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.52e-45 ≈ 6.96e9 rad^-1 s^-1 (since B has units of 1/s).

Wait, but the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). For J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = B * 2. So ΔE = 2 B.

So ΔE_rot = 2 * B = 2 * 6.96e9 * 1 (since J=1). Wait, 2 * 6.96e9 = 1.392e10 rad/s.

Wait, but wait, no. B has units of 1/s. So E_rot would be in Joules per second times J(J+1), which is dimensionless. So E_rot = B * J(J+1) in Joules per second multiplied by J(J+1) → that would give energy in Joules? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me correct this. The rotational constant B in terms of energy is given by (ℏ²)/(2 I), where ℏ is h-bar. Wait, no, perhaps I messed up earlier.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ℏ²/(2 I)) * J (J+1). Because the standard formula is (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So let me compute that.

ℏ = h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.055e-34 J s.

So E_rot = ( (1.055e-34)^2 ) / (2 * I) ) * J (J+1).

I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So compute numerator: (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.113e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So E_rot for J=1 is (1.113e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ) * 2 (since J=1: J(J+1)=2).

So (1.113e-68 / 2.4128e-46) = approximately 4.61e-23. Multiply by 2: 9.22e-23 J.

Which matches what I had earlier. So ΔE_rot ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So photon energy E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Then, momentum p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / (3e8) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

Wait, but the options are way larger than that. So what's wrong here? Let me check the given values again.

Wait, the bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me check that again.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 = approx 1.81818 amu.

Hmm, that's correct.

So I = μ R² = 1.81818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So 1.81818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg. So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m². That's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere else.

Wait, the problem says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is a non-rigid rotor. But I assumed it's a rigid rotor. So maybe the moment of inertia isn't exactly R², but perhaps depends on vibration as well. But that might complicate things, and I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the model being considered is a rigid rotor, so my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but why is the photon's momentum so low? The options are on the order of 1e-27, which is about 1e6 times larger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the energy. Let me recheck E_rot.

Wait, E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1). For J=0, E_rot=0. For J=1, E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

So E_rot = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * pi^2 * I) ) * 2.

Let's compute that again.

Compute numerator: h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.389e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I = 8*(9.8696)*1.2064e-46 ≈ 8*9.8696 =78.9568; 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 ≈ 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45 kg m².

So (h²)/(8 pi² I) ) = 4.389e-67 / 9.52e-45 ≈ 4.61e-23 J. Multiply by 2: 9.22e-23 J. So that's correct.

Hmm. So the energy required is 9.22e-23 J. Photon's momentum is E/c = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are much larger. So this suggests I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the simultaneous change in both rotation and vibration, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in that case, the ΔE would be 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger than the rotational. But why would the photon's momentum be in the range of options given?

Let me compute p for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 N*s

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm. 8.83e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but about 4.6 times larger.

Wait, 8.8e-28 is about 4.6 times 1.9e-28. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next available state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). But that would require the vibrational energy, which is larger than the rotational.

But the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' The next state in energy would be the one with the least energy increase, which is the rotational transition. So why is the photon's momentum so much lower than the options?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, but the rotational state could be higher. Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest possible energy, which includes both v=0 and J=0.

Wait, maybe the model is considering the Raman transition, where simultaneous rotational and vibrational changes occur. But that complicates things beyond what I can handle right now.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the vibrational energy. Let me think again. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So when v=0, E= ½ h w. When v=1, E= 3/2 h w. So the energy difference is h w. So ΔE_vib = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J, as before.

So photon energy is 2.65e-19 J, p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 45% of this value. Hmm.

Is there any possibility that the calculation is based on the first rotational state (J=1) for a diatomic molecule, but using a different formula?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the energy levels as a combination of both rotation and vibration, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, and v=0 to v=1, but that would be a combination of both, which is probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition within the same vibrational state, but that would be a rotational transition.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Let me double-check μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = 3.016, so 3.016e-27 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the model is using the non-rigid rotor, which has a different expression for energy levels, but I don't remember the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the energy levels in a non-rigid rotor isn't as straightforward, but I think the approach I took was correct for a rigid rotor.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition not from J=0 to J=1, but from J=1 to J=2, but that would give a higher energy, which doesn't make sense because the next state would be J=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the change in momentum, but the question asks for the photon's momentum when it is absorbed, which should just be E/c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibration's frequency, but in the rotational model, the energy is related to the rotation's frequency.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the rotational frequency. Let's see.

The rotational constant B is h/(8 pi² I), which I calculated earlier as approximately 6.96e9 1/s. So the rotational frequency would be nu_rot = B / (2 pi) ≈ 1.106e9 Hz.

But I'm not sure how that helps here.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is between the rotational and vibrational energy levels, but I'm not seeing where I went wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the rotational energy for J=1, which is 2 B, and find the photon's momentum from that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the rotational energy in terms of frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = B * 2. And B = h/(8 pi² I). So E_rot = 2 h/(8 pi² I) ) = h/(4 pi² I).

But I think I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the question states it's a non-rigid rotor. Wait, a non-rigid rotor would have a moment of inertia that changes with vibration, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels. Maybe it's treated as a simple harmonic oscillator for vibration and a rigid rotor for rotation.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again: the photon's momentum is E/c, which for the rotational transition is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is way below the options given. For the vibrational transition, it's 8.83e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28), but not exactly matching. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, wait: the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is v=0, the lowest vibrational state. The 'next state' could refer to the first vibrational state (v=1) or the first rotational state (J=1). But according to the energies, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

But the options don't have anything that close to 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the rotational energy levels in terms of the rotational constant B. The energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1 or some other units. Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, B is given by (h c)/(8 pi² I), where c is the speed of light.

Wait, that might be a different approach.

Let me compute B using this formula.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (8 pi² * 1.2064e-46)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator: 8 pi² = 78.956. Multiply by I: 78.956 * 1.2064e-46 = 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45.

So B = (1.9878e-25) / (9.52e-45) ) ≈ 2.087e19 cm^-1? Wait, no, the units would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should convert I into g cm², because sometimes B is expressed in cm^-1.

Wait, 1 kg m² = 10^3 g * (100 cm)^2 = 1e3 * 1e4 g cm² = 1e7 g cm². So I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e7 g cm² = 1.2064e-39 g cm².

Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps B is in units of reciprocal seconds (1/s), which is what I had earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of frequency.

Wait, B = h/(8 pi² I) = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 * pi² * 1.2064e-46 kg m²).

As before, that gives B ≈ 6.96e9 1/s.

So E_rot(J=1) is 2 * B = 1.39e10 1/s.

Wait, but energy is in Joules, so E_rot = B * J(J+1) → but B has units of 1/s. So E_rot must have units of J s^{-1} × s^2? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing units.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm not using the correct formula for B in terms of energy. Let me think: E_rot = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1), which is correct.

Yes, that gives E_rot in Joules.

Wait, I think I might have to accept that my calculation leads to a photon momentum of 3e-31 Ns, but the options don't have anything that small. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the change in momentum, which in the case of a photon is the same as the photon's momentum. But perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in linear momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon, but that seems unlikely as photons don't directly contribute linear momentum to a molecule in a rotational transition. Wait, but a photon's momentum is h nu / c, which is what I calculated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So it's a pure vibrational transition, requiring energy h w.

Wait, but earlier, I found that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would it absorb a photon to go to a higher energy state? Unless the question is considering that the next state is the first possible state, regardless of energy, which would be the next vibrational state, but that doesn't make sense because the rotational state would be lower.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A: 1.9e-28 Ns. Because that's the only option close to 8.83e-28, possibly if I made a miscalculation in the energy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recheck.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that.

Wait, could the problem have a mistake in the given values? Or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms. Maybe I used 1 angstrom incorrectly. Oh no, I used 2e-10 m correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited rotational state (J=1), but including the vibrational energy. Wait, but that would be a combination, which isn't standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would be a larger energy difference, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the vibrational transition, despite the lower energy being in the rotational. Maybe the question is neglecting the rotational states and only considering vibration.

If that's the case, then the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, but the closest option is A:1.9e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So mu = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22=20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. That is correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in a different unit? No, the problem states R is 2 angstroms.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28. But why?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me compute E_rot for J=1 using the formula E_rot = (h c B) * J (J+1) ?

Wait, no, B is in cm^-1, which is energy per photon in terms of wavenumbers. Or perhaps I'm mixing up different forms of the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of frequency, which would be nu_rot = B/(2 pi).

Wait, earlier calculation gave B = ~7e9 1/s.

So nu_rot = 7e9 / (2 pi) ≈ 1.12e9 Hz.

But that still doesn't directly help with the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational transition. So the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about which transition is considered.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns. Let me see if that corresponds to any possible calculation.

If E_photon = p c = 1.9e-28 Ns *3e8 m/s = 5.7e-20 J.

What frequency would that correspond to? E = h f → f = E/h = 5.7e-20 / 6.626e-34 ≈ 8.6e13 Hz. But the given angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s, which is about 6.4e13 Hz. So that doesn't match.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition, but using a different formula.

Wait, maybe the energy is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) ) = h w, as I did, but perhaps the photon's energy is (1/2 h w), which would be the zero point energy. But that's not a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's energy as ½ h w, but that doesn't make sense because the transition from v=0 to v=1 requires a photon with energy h w.

Wait, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, but given the options, the only one close to my vibrational calculation is option A, but it's about 4.6 times smaller than my result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of 1 amu in kg.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So mu = 40/22 amu = (40/22) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Calculating 40/22 = 1.818181818...

1.818181818 * 1.66053906660e-27 = ?

Let me compute this:

1.818181818 * 1.6605390666e-27.

= (1.818181818 * 1.6605390666) * 1e-27.

Compute 1.81818 *1.660539.

1.8 * 1.66 = 2.988.

0.01818 * 1.66 ≈ 0.02999.

So total ≈ 2.988 + 0.02999 ≈ 3.01799.

So approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = mu * R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Which is what I had earlier.

Hmm, I can't see where I went wrong. Perhaps I should proceed and choose the option that best fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon for the transition to the next state, considering both rotation and vibration, but that would be a combination that I'm not familiar with.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, even though my calculation doesn't directly match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the vibrational energy calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, regardless of energy. The first state after the ground state would be either J=1 or v=1, but the problem states the next state with the lowest possible energy, implying the smallest energy increase, which is the rotational transition.

So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like the selection rules. But I don't think that affects the momentum calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the photon's momentum is zero because the molecule's center of mass doesn't move, but that doesn't make sense because the photon does carry momentum.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the vibrational transition as the answer, even though it's not matching exactly. So the photon's momentum is approximately 8.83e-28 Ns, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula for the rotational energy.

Alternative formula: E_rot = (h c B) J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

But in that case, I would need to compute B in cm^-1.

B = (h c) / (8 pi² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (8 pi² * 1.2064e-46 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 8 pi² *1.2064e-46 = 78.956 *1.2064e-46 = 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45.

So B = 1.9878e-25 / 9.52e-45 = 2.087e19 cm^-1? Wait, no. Because 1 J m is 1 kg m^2/s^2 * m = kg m^3/s^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert I into g cm².

Wait, 1 kg = 1000 g.

1 m = 100 cm.

So I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e3 g * (1e2 cm)^2 = 1.2064e-46 * 1e3 * 1e4 cm² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e7 g cm² = 1.2064e-39 g cm².

So B = (h c) / (8 pi² I) )

h = 6.626e-34 J s = 6.626e-34 kg m²/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 kg m²/s² = 1.9878e-25 J.

Denominator: 8 pi² I = 78.956 * 1.2064e-39 g cm².

Wait, 1 g cm² is 1e-7 kg m².

So 78.956 *1.2064e-39 g cm² = 78.956 *1.2064e-39 * 1e-7 kg m² = 78.956 *1.2064e-46 kg m².

So denominator is 78.956 *1.2064e-46 kg m² = 95.2e-46 kg m² = 9.52e-45 kg m².

So B = (1.9878e-25 J) / (9.52e-45 kg m²) )

Wait, J is kg m²/s².

So B = (1.9878e-25 kg m²/s²) / (9.52e-45 kg m²) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (9.52e-45) ) s^-2.

Wait, that can't be right. I'm getting units wrong. Alternatively, perhaps B should have units of cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of cm^-1.

Anyway, perhaps this approach isn't helping. I think I'll have to conclude that, despite the calculations, the correct answer is A) 1.9e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of a photon that causes a diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state (v = 0, J = 0), and the goal is to identify the photon's momentum required for the smallest energy increase.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels**:
   - **Vibrational Energy**: The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_{\text{vib}} = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \). The energy difference between \( v = 0 \) (ground state) and \( v = 1 \) (first excited state) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s})(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - **Rotational Energy**: The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) is the rotational constant. The moment of inertia \( I \) is calculated as:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2, \quad \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}.
     \]
     Substituting \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), and \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
     \[
     \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     I = (3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg})(2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg m}^2.
     \]
     The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.2064 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 6.96 \times 10^9 \, \text{rad/s}.
     \]
     The energy difference for the transition \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 6.96 \times 10^9 \, \text{rad/s} = 1.392 \times 10^{10} \, \text{rad/s}.
     \]
     Converting to joules:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h \Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{2 \pi} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (1.392 \times 10^{10})}{2 \pi} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), the rotational transition requires less energy and is therefore the next state with the lowest possible energy.

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N s}.
     \]
     This value is far smaller than the options provided, suggesting a mismatch between the calculated result and the given choices.

4. **Vibrational Transition (Alternative Analysis)**:
   - If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the photon's momentum would be:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}.
     \]
     Among the options, the closest match is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s} \)**, though it is about 4.6 times smaller than the calculated value.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, even though the rotational transition requires less energy. Based on the given options, the best match is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum mechanics and molecules. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state. The next state with the lowest energy would be the first excited state. But wait, what's the model here? Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor model considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

In the quantum rotation model, the energy levels are quantized. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But wait, the non-rigid rotor model might have a bit more complexity, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying it to a rigid rotor since it's giving me a vibrational frequency.

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational states. Oh, but the molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. So for a diatomic, the ground state is typically the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0).

Wait, but when it absorbs a photon, it needs to transition to the next state. But what's the 'next' state in terms of quantum numbers? Well, the molecule could either increase its rotational state or its vibrational state. But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's the next higher state in terms of energy, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

But wait, in the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. The total energy would be E_total = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1 (vibrational first excited) or J=1 (rotational first excited). But which transition requires less energy? Because we need the photon that switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy, so perhaps the one with the smallest energy difference.

Wait, the problem says the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the smallest energy increase possible. So the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the one with the least energy above that. So maybe the rotational transition to J=1 would be lower energy than the vibrational transition to v=1. Or perhaps the opposite.

I need to calculate the energy required for both transitions and see which is smaller.

First, let's find the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the ground state is v=0: E0 = (1/2) h w. The first excited vibrational state is v=1: E1 = (3/2) h w. So the energy difference ΔE_vib = E1 - E0 = h w.

Next, the rotational energy difference. For a rigid rotor, E_rot = B J (J +1), where B is the rotational constant given by h/(8 π² I c), but wait, more accurately, B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), or maybe I should look up the formula. Alternatively, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I: B = h/(8 π² I). Oh wait, no, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (h²/(8 π² I) ) * 2 ] - 0 = 2 (h²/(8 π² I)) ) = h²/(4 π² I).

So I need to compute both ΔE_vib = h w and ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² I).

Which one is smaller? Let's compute both.

But wait, what are the given values? Let me check:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. Molecular bond length R = 2 angstroms. Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s.

First, compute I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) )

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx + My is 22 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert this into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 is approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, let me be precise:

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.6605 = about 3. (1.8 *1.6 is 2.88, 1.8*0.0605 is ~0.1089, total 2.9889). So approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, but 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg.

Wait, no: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So total μ is (20 *2)/(22) amu = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu. So 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So R² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now compute ΔE_rot, which is h²/(4 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

4 π² is about 39.478.

So denominator is 4 π² I ≈ 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ let's compute that.

39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.65e-46 ≈ 4.765e-45.

Wait, 39.478 * 1.2064 is approx 39.478*1.2=47.37, 39.478*0.0064=0.252, so total 47.622. So 47.622e-46 = 4.7622e-45.

So ΔE_rot ≈ (4.39e-67) / (4.7622e-45) ) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² I) = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (4 * (pi)^2 * 1.2064e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 * pi^2 ≈ 39.478. Multiply by I (1.2064e-46): 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.65e-46 = 4.765e-45.

So 4.39e-67 / 4.765e-45 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm. Now the vibrational energy is ΔE_vib = h * w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two: 9.21e-23 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would be absorbed to cause a rotational transition, not a vibrational one.

Wait, but the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So the next state in energy would be the one with the smallest possible increase. So the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next state could be either v=1 (ΔE=2.65e-19 J) or J=1 (ΔE=9.21e-23 J). So the smallest ΔE is the rotational one. So the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. Are the rotational and vibrational states quantized separately? So the total energy is the sum of both. So in the ground state, both v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1 and J=0, or v=0 and J=1, whichever has the lower energy.

So which has lower energy? The J=1 transition requires about 9e-23 J, which is much less than 2.6e-19 J. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But the question is about momentum, not energy. So how do we find the momentum p from the energy?

Energy of a photon is E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

E is 9.21e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Wait, 1 Ns is kg m/s. So 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 Ns, which is 0.3e-30 Ns. But the options are much larger: 1.9e-28 Ns is bigger than that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I got the energy wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Did I compute the rotational energy correctly?

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by h / (8 π² I), correct?

So B = h/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 * (pi^2) * 1.2064e-46 kg m² )

Let me compute the denominator: 8 pi^2 is approximately 78.956. Multiply by I (1.2064e-46): 78.956 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.52e-45 ≈ 6.96e9 rad^-1 s^-1 (since B has units of 1/s).

Wait, but the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). For J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = B * 2. So ΔE = 2 B.

So ΔE_rot = 2 * B = 2 * 6.96e9 * 1 (since J=1). Wait, 2 * 6.96e9 = 1.392e10 rad/s.

Wait, but wait, no. B has units of 1/s. So E_rot would be in Joules per second times J(J+1), which is dimensionless. So E_rot = B * J(J+1) in Joules per second multiplied by J(J+1) → that would give energy in Joules? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me correct this. The rotational constant B in terms of energy is given by (ℏ²)/(2 I), where ℏ is h-bar. Wait, no, perhaps I messed up earlier.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ℏ²/(2 I)) * J (J+1). Because the standard formula is (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So let me compute that.

ℏ = h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.055e-34 J s.

So E_rot = ( (1.055e-34)^2 ) / (2 * I) ) * J (J+1).

I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So compute numerator: (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.113e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So E_rot for J=1 is (1.113e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ) * 2 (since J=1: J(J+1)=2).

So (1.113e-68 / 2.4128e-46) = approximately 4.61e-23. Multiply by 2: 9.22e-23 J.

Which matches what I had earlier. So ΔE_rot ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So photon energy E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Then, momentum p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / (3e8) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

Wait, but the options are way larger than that. So what's wrong here? Let me check the given values again.

Wait, the bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me check that again.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 = approx 1.81818 amu.

Hmm, that's correct.

So I = μ R² = 1.81818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So 1.81818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg. So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m². That's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere else.

Wait, the problem says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is a non-rigid rotor. But I assumed it's a rigid rotor. So maybe the moment of inertia isn't exactly R², but perhaps depends on vibration as well. But that might complicate things, and I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the model being considered is a rigid rotor, so my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but why is the photon's momentum so low? The options are on the order of 1e-27, which is about 1e6 times larger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the energy. Let me recheck E_rot.

Wait, E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1). For J=0, E_rot=0. For J=1, E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

So E_rot = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * pi^2 * I) ) * 2.

Let's compute that again.

Compute numerator: h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.389e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I = 8*(9.8696)*1.2064e-46 ≈ 8*9.8696 =78.9568; 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 ≈ 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45 kg m².

So (h²)/(8 pi² I) ) = 4.389e-67 / 9.52e-45 ≈ 4.61e-23 J. Multiply by 2: 9.22e-23 J. So that's correct.

Hmm. So the energy required is 9.22e-23 J. Photon's momentum is E/c = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are much larger. So this suggests I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the simultaneous change in both rotation and vibration, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in that case, the ΔE would be 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger than the rotational. But why would the photon's momentum be in the range of options given?

Let me compute p for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 N*s

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm. 8.83e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but about 4.6 times larger.

Wait, 8.8e-28 is about 4.6 times 1.9e-28. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next available state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). But that would require the vibrational energy, which is larger than the rotational.

But the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' The next state in energy would be the one with the least energy increase, which is the rotational transition. So why is the photon's momentum so much lower than the options?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, but the rotational state could be higher. Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest possible energy, which includes both v=0 and J=0.

Wait, maybe the model is considering the Raman transition, where simultaneous rotational and vibrational changes occur. But that complicates things beyond what I can handle right now.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the vibrational energy. Let me think again. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So when v=0, E= ½ h w. When v=1, E= 3/2 h w. So the energy difference is h w. So ΔE_vib = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J, as before.

So photon energy is 2.65e-19 J, p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 45% of this value. Hmm.

Is there any possibility that the calculation is based on the first rotational state (J=1) for a diatomic molecule, but using a different formula?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the energy levels as a combination of both rotation and vibration, but I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, and v=0 to v=1, but that would be a combination of both, which is probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition within the same vibrational state, but that would be a rotational transition.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Let me double-check μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = 3.016, so 3.016e-27 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the model is using the non-rigid rotor, which has a different expression for energy levels, but I don't remember the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the energy levels in a non-rigid rotor isn't as straightforward, but I think the approach I took was correct for a rigid rotor.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition not from J=0 to J=1, but from J=1 to J=2, but that would give a higher energy, which doesn't make sense because the next state would be J=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the change in momentum, but the question asks for the photon's momentum when it is absorbed, which should just be E/c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibration's frequency, but in the rotational model, the energy is related to the rotation's frequency.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the rotational frequency. Let's see.

The rotational constant B is h/(8 pi² I), which I calculated earlier as approximately 6.96e9 1/s. So the rotational frequency would be nu_rot = B / (2 pi) ≈ 1.106e9 Hz.

But I'm not sure how that helps here.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is between the rotational and vibrational energy levels, but I'm not seeing where I went wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the rotational energy for J=1, which is 2 B, and find the photon's momentum from that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the rotational energy in terms of frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = B * 2. And B = h/(8 pi² I). So E_rot = 2 h/(8 pi² I) ) = h/(4 pi² I).

But I think I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the question states it's a non-rigid rotor. Wait, a non-rigid rotor would have a moment of inertia that changes with vibration, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels. Maybe it's treated as a simple harmonic oscillator for vibration and a rigid rotor for rotation.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again: the photon's momentum is E/c, which for the rotational transition is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is way below the options given. For the vibrational transition, it's 8.83e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28), but not exactly matching. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, wait: the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is v=0, the lowest vibrational state. The 'next state' could refer to the first vibrational state (v=1) or the first rotational state (J=1). But according to the energies, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

But the options don't have anything that close to 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the rotational energy levels in terms of the rotational constant B. The energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1 or some other units. Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, B is given by (h c)/(8 pi² I), where c is the speed of light.

Wait, that might be a different approach.

Let me compute B using this formula.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (8 pi² * 1.2064e-46)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator: 8 pi² = 78.956. Multiply by I: 78.956 * 1.2064e-46 = 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45.

So B = (1.9878e-25) / (9.52e-45) ) ≈ 2.087e19 cm^-1? Wait, no, the units would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should convert I into g cm², because sometimes B is expressed in cm^-1.

Wait, 1 kg m² = 10^3 g * (100 cm)^2 = 1e3 * 1e4 g cm² = 1e7 g cm². So I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e7 g cm² = 1.2064e-39 g cm².

Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps B is in units of reciprocal seconds (1/s), which is what I had earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of frequency.

Wait, B = h/(8 pi² I) = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 * pi² * 1.2064e-46 kg m²).

As before, that gives B ≈ 6.96e9 1/s.

So E_rot(J=1) is 2 * B = 1.39e10 1/s.

Wait, but energy is in Joules, so E_rot = B * J(J+1) → but B has units of 1/s. So E_rot must have units of J s^{-1} × s^2? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing units.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm not using the correct formula for B in terms of energy. Let me think: E_rot = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1), which is correct.

Yes, that gives E_rot in Joules.

Wait, I think I might have to accept that my calculation leads to a photon momentum of 3e-31 Ns, but the options don't have anything that small. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the change in momentum, which in the case of a photon is the same as the photon's momentum. But perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in linear momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon, but that seems unlikely as photons don't directly contribute linear momentum to a molecule in a rotational transition. Wait, but a photon's momentum is h nu / c, which is what I calculated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So it's a pure vibrational transition, requiring energy h w.

Wait, but earlier, I found that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would it absorb a photon to go to a higher energy state? Unless the question is considering that the next state is the first possible state, regardless of energy, which would be the next vibrational state, but that doesn't make sense because the rotational state would be lower.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A: 1.9e-28 Ns. Because that's the only option close to 8.83e-28, possibly if I made a miscalculation in the energy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recheck.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that.

Wait, could the problem have a mistake in the given values? Or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms. Maybe I used 1 angstrom incorrectly. Oh no, I used 2e-10 m correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited rotational state (J=1), but including the vibrational energy. Wait, but that would be a combination, which isn't standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would be a larger energy difference, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the vibrational transition, despite the lower energy being in the rotational. Maybe the question is neglecting the rotational states and only considering vibration.

If that's the case, then the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, but the closest option is A:1.9e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So mu = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22=20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. That is correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in a different unit? No, the problem states R is 2 angstroms.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28. But why?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me compute E_rot for J=1 using the formula E_rot = (h c B) * J (J+1) ?

Wait, no, B is in cm^-1, which is energy per photon in terms of wavenumbers. Or perhaps I'm mixing up different forms of the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate B in terms of frequency, which would be nu_rot = B/(2 pi).

Wait, earlier calculation gave B = ~7e9 1/s.

So nu_rot = 7e9 / (2 pi) ≈ 1.12e9 Hz.

But that still doesn't directly help with the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational transition. So the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about which transition is considered.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns. Let me see if that corresponds to any possible calculation.

If E_photon = p c = 1.9e-28 Ns *3e8 m/s = 5.7e-20 J.

What frequency would that correspond to? E = h f → f = E/h = 5.7e-20 / 6.626e-34 ≈ 8.6e13 Hz. But the given angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s, which is about 6.4e13 Hz. So that doesn't match.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition, but using a different formula.

Wait, maybe the energy is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) ) = h w, as I did, but perhaps the photon's energy is (1/2 h w), which would be the zero point energy. But that's not a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's energy as ½ h w, but that doesn't make sense because the transition from v=0 to v=1 requires a photon with energy h w.

Wait, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, but given the options, the only one close to my vibrational calculation is option A, but it's about 4.6 times smaller than my result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of 1 amu in kg.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So mu = 40/22 amu = (40/22) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Calculating 40/22 = 1.818181818...

1.818181818 * 1.66053906660e-27 = ?

Let me compute this:

1.818181818 * 1.6605390666e-27.

= (1.818181818 * 1.6605390666) * 1e-27.

Compute 1.81818 *1.660539.

1.8 * 1.66 = 2.988.

0.01818 * 1.66 ≈ 0.02999.

So total ≈ 2.988 + 0.02999 ≈ 3.01799.

So approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = mu * R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Which is what I had earlier.

Hmm, I can't see where I went wrong. Perhaps I should proceed and choose the option that best fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon for the transition to the next state, considering both rotation and vibration, but that would be a combination that I'm not familiar with.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, even though my calculation doesn't directly match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the vibrational energy calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, regardless of energy. The first state after the ground state would be either J=1 or v=1, but the problem states the next state with the lowest possible energy, implying the smallest energy increase, which is the rotational transition.

So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like the selection rules. But I don't think that affects the momentum calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the photon's momentum is zero because the molecule's center of mass doesn't move, but that doesn't make sense because the photon does carry momentum.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the vibrational transition as the answer, even though it's not matching exactly. So the photon's momentum is approximately 8.83e-28 Ns, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula for the rotational energy.

Alternative formula: E_rot = (h c B) J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

But in that case, I would need to compute B in cm^-1.

B = (h c) / (8 pi² I).

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (8 pi² * 1.2064e-46 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 8 pi² *1.2064e-46 = 78.956 *1.2064e-46 = 95.2e-46 = 9.52e-45.

So B = 1.9878e-25 / 9.52e-45 = 2.087e19 cm^-1? Wait, no. Because 1 J m is 1 kg m^2/s^2 * m = kg m^3/s^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert I into g cm².

Wait, 1 kg = 1000 g.

1 m = 100 cm.

So I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e3 g * (1e2 cm)^2 = 1.2064e-46 * 1e3 * 1e4 cm² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e7 g cm² = 1.2064e-39 g cm².

So B = (h c) / (8 pi² I) )

h = 6.626e-34 J s = 6.626e-34 kg m²/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 kg m²/s² = 1.9878e-25 J.

Denominator: 8 pi² I = 78.956 * 1.2064e-39 g cm².

Wait, 1 g cm² is 1e-7 kg m².

So 78.956 *1.2064e-39 g cm² = 78.956 *1.2064e-39 * 1e-7 kg m² = 78.956 *1.2064e-46 kg m².

So denominator is 78.956 *1.2064e-46 kg m² = 95.2e-46 kg m² = 9.52e-45 kg m².

So B = (1.9878e-25 J) / (9.52e-45 kg m²) )

Wait, J is kg m²/s².

So B = (1.9878e-25 kg m²/s²) / (9.52e-45 kg m²) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (9.52e-45) ) s^-2.

Wait, that can't be right. I'm getting units wrong. Alternatively, perhaps B should have units of cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of cm^-1.

Anyway, perhaps this approach isn't helping. I think I'll have to conclude that, despite the calculations, the correct answer is A) 1.9e-28 Ns.


To determine the momentum of a photon that causes a diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state (v = 0, J = 0), and the goal is to identify the photon's momentum required for the smallest energy increase.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels**:
   - **Vibrational Energy**: The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_{\text{vib}} = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \). The energy difference between \( v = 0 \) (ground state) and \( v = 1 \) (first excited state) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s})(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - **Rotational Energy**: The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) is the rotational constant. The moment of inertia \( I \) is calculated as:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2, \quad \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}.
     \]
     Substituting \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), and \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
     \[
     \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     I = (3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg})(2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg m}^2.
     \]
     The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.2064 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 6.96 \times 10^9 \, \text{rad/s}.
     \]
     The energy difference for the transition \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 6.96 \times 10^9 \, \text{rad/s} = 1.392 \times 10^{10} \, \text{rad/s}.
     \]
     Converting to joules:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h \Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{2 \pi} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (1.392 \times 10^{10})}{2 \pi} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), while the rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \), the rotational transition requires less energy and is therefore the next state with the lowest possible energy.

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N s}.
     \]
     This value is far smaller than the options provided, suggesting a mismatch between the calculated result and the given choices.

4. **Vibrational Transition (Alternative Analysis)**:
   - If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the photon's momentum would be:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s}.
     \]
     Among the options, the closest match is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N s} \)**, though it is about 4.6 times smaller than the calculated value.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, even though the rotational transition requires less energy. Based on the given options, the best match is:

**Answer: A**
