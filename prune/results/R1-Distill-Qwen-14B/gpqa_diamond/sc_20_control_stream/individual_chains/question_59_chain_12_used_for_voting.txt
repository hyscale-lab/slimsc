Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. The volumes and concentrations are given for each. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base there is in total and see if they neutralize each other, and what's left after that.

Let me jot down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

Wait, I should probably calculate the total moles of each acid and base first. Because when you mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2OH^-. So I need to account for that.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

First, for CH3COOH: it's a weak acid, but for calculating the neutralization, I think I can treat it as providing H+ from the acid, but since it's weak, maybe I can't assume it fully dissociates. Hmm, but wait, when you're mixing acids and bases, perhaps the strong ones will donate a lot of H+ and the base a lot of OH-, so maybe the weak acid's contribution is negligible in the initial neutralization? Or maybe not, I'm not sure. I'll think about this later.

So, let's compute the moles for each component.

Moles of CH3COOH: Molarity × Volume (in liters)
0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But wait, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix these, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl^- ions. So the 0.08 moles of HCl will contribute 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. But wait, in a neutralization reaction, perhaps I can't ignore it. Or maybe because it's a weak acid, the amount of H+ it can donate is less than the strong acid. Hmm, but when mixing with a strong base, perhaps the reaction proceeds differently. Maybe I should treat all the H+ available (from HCl and CH3COOH) and the OH- (from Ba(OH)2) and see which is in excess.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in a solution, it doesn't release a lot of H+ on its own. So perhaps when mixed with the strong base, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first react with the H+ from HCl, as it's a strong acid and provides a lot of H+ ions.

Wait, but the problem is that all these are in the same solution, so they'll all react together. Let me think about the net reaction.

The strong acid (HCl) will donate H+; the weak acid (CH3COOH) will donate some H+; and the Ba(OH)2 will donate OH-.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait: HCl is a strong acid, so in solution, it's fully dissociated. So 0.08 moles of HCl → 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. Its dissociation is small, but in the presence of a strong base, maybe the acetate ions (CH3COO^-) will react with the OH-? Or not?

Wait, actually, when you mix all these together, you have a solution with H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- from Ba(OH)2. The H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, but since the H+ comes from two sources, I need to sum them.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate the total moles of H+ and the total moles of OH-.

Wait, but HCl is 0.08 moles H+, Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles OH-.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08, and from CH3COOH, well, maybe I can ignore it for now, but let me think. Since the problem involves a weak acid, perhaps in the initial neutralization, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH-.

Wait, but I think I have to consider all H+ sources. But since HCl is a strong acid, it's 0.08 moles H+. The CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, but it's a weak acid, so it won't contribute as much H+. So the initial H+ in solution is 0.08 (from HCl) plus some from CH3COOH. But maybe, for the purpose of neutralization, the contribution from CH3COOH is negligible compared to the strong acid? Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so the OH- is 0.18 moles.

So, the total H+ available is 0.08 (from HCl) plus some from CH3COOH.

But wait, when you mix all three solutions, the total volume is 500+400+300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Wait, so the total volume is 1.2 liters.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this systematically.

First, calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. So 0.08 H+.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is as follows:

H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So, the total H+ available is 0.08 (from HCl) plus the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so if I have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, it will only dissociate a little, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the acetate ions will react.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the OH- from the base will first neutralize the H+ from the strong acid (HCl) and any other available H+.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think: when you mix HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base), they will neutralize each other. The excess will determine the pH.

But also, I have CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. So perhaps the neutralization process goes like this:

1. H+ from HCl reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form water.
2. Any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, all available H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) will react with the OH-.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to proceed.

So, initial moles of H+:

HCl: 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol (but it's a weak acid, so its H+ contribution is less than 0.05 mol. Maybe we can approximate it as negligible compared to the strong acid, but I'm not sure.)

Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol.

So, the reaction would be: H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) + OH- → H2O.

So, the total H+ available is 0.08 (HCl) + (some from CH3COOH). Let's say for now that the CH3COOH contributes x moles of H+.

But wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the net H+ after reaction with OH-.

So, the OH- is 0.18 mol, H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

So, the OH- can neutralize 0.08 mol of H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH- remaining.

But wait, that's not right. Because each mole of OH- neutralizes one mole of H+.

So, 0.08 mol H+ (HCl) reacts with 0.08 mol OH- (Ba(OH)2), leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

But then, the remaining OH- (0.10 mol) will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the OH- will deprotonate it, producing CH3COO^-.

The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the OH- will neutralize some of the CH3COOH.

So, moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH- left after HCl reaction: 0.10 mol.

So, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So, the OH- can neutralize 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, because that's all there is.

So, after this reaction, all the CH3COOH would be converted to CH3COO^- and water, and any remaining OH- would be whatever is left after that.

Wait, so 0.10 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, consuming all of the CH3COOH. So, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So now, after all these reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- left, and the volume is 1.2 L.

Wait, but wait: let's check.

Initial moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Initial moles of OH-: 0.18.

H+ and OH- react 1:1.

So, 0.08 H+ and 0.08 OH- neutralize each other, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, this 0.10 OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 OH- reacts with 0.05 CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 OH-.

So, total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

So, total moles of OH- remaining: 0.05.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, the pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38 (since log(0.04) is around 1.39794, but let me calculate more accurately).

Wait, 0.0416667 is approximately 4.16667e-2.

Taking log: log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2)
log(4.16667) ≈ 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381.

So pOH ≈ 1.381.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.381 ≈ 12.619.

Wait, that's around 12.62. Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

But wait, am I missing something? Because I thought that after the neutralization, the solution would have excess OH- from the strong base, but perhaps I should consider if the CH3COOH is completely neutralized.

Wait, another thought: when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, the reaction produces CH3COO^-.

So, after the reaction, the solution will have excess OH- from Ba(OH)2, but wait, no. Because I had 0.18 moles OH- initially. After neutralizing 0.08 moles from HCl and 0.05 from CH3COOH, I have 0.05 moles left.

So, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the CH3COOH's contribution of H+.

Because, when CH3COOH is in solution, even before any reaction, it can donate H+ ions. But since the solution also has a lot of OH- from the strong base, perhaps the OH- will first neutralize all the H+ from HCl and then the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, let me think again: the OH- will neutralize the H+ from the strongest acid first, then the weaker. Since HCl is a strong acid, it donates a lot of H+ (0.08 mol), and the OH- (0.18 mol) will first neutralize that. So, 0.08 mol OH- reacts with 0.08 mol HCl, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Since CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, it will react with 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the total OH- in solution is 0.05 mol, in 1.2 L.

So, concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach: perhaps the CH3COOH and HCl are both acting as acids, so their total H+ is 0.08 + (some from CH3COOH). But in the presence of a strong base, maybe the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible, but perhaps I should calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is right, and the pH is 12.62.

Wait, another thought: when you mix the solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L. The moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, I think that because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it will contribute a lot of OH- ions. HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is less, but in the presence of excess OH- from the base, perhaps it doesn't contribute much.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the net H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps another way to approach this is to calculate the total H+ and total OH- in the solution, regardless of their sources.

So, H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol, but since it's weak, let's say it contributes x mol H+.

But when you have a lot of OH- present, the H+ from CH3COOH would react with OH- to form water. So, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible because the OH- is in excess.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the OH- was 0.18, H+ from HCl is 0.08. So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 OH-.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the pH is calculated based on this.

So, the pH comes out to be approximately 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, let's double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the contribution of CH3COOH's H+ before the neutralization.

Wait, because when you mix all the solutions, you have H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the net reaction is H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) + OH- → H2O.

So, the total H+ is from HCl plus the H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so its Ka is about 1.8e-5. The concentration after mixing is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

So, the H+ from CH3COOH can be calculated using the formula for weak acids: [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C).

So,

Ka = 1.8e-5

C = 0.0416667 M.

[H+] = sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.0416667) = sqrt(7.5e-7) ≈ 8.66e-4 M.

Moles of H+ from CH3COOH = 0.0416667 L * 8.66e-4 M ≈ 3.61e-5 mol.

So, the H+ from CH3COOH is about 3.6e-5 mol, which is much less than the 0.08 mol from HCl.

So, when the OH- (0.18 mol) reacts with the H+ (0.08 + 3.6e-5 ≈ 0.080036 mol), the OH- will neutralize all of it, leaving 0.18 - 0.080036 ≈ 0.100 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- is 0.100 mol. But wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Wait, because when I considered the CH3COOH, I thought that after neutralizing the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, the OH- was 0.05 mol.

But wait, that approach may have been wrong. Let me recalculate.

So, the OH- is 0.18 mol.

The H+ is 0.08 (HCl) + 3.6e-5 (CH3COOH) ≈ 0.080036.

So, the OH- will neutralize all of this H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.080036 ≈ 0.099964 mol OH-.

Wait, but that's about 0.10 mol OH-.

Now, what's left is 0.10 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.10 / 1.2 ≈ 0.083333 M.

pOH = -log(0.083333) ≈ 1.08.

So, pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) 12.62, B)1.38, etc.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should not include the H+ from CH3COOH because the solution is strongly basic due to the presence of OH- from Ba(OH)2, so the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible.

So, perhaps the initial calculation where after neutralizing H+ from HCl, the OH- is 0.10 mol, then that OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 mol.

So, the OH- (0.10 mol) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 mol), neutralizing it, and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which is option A.

But earlier, when I included the H+ from CH3COOH, I got a pH of about 12.92, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the H+ from CH3COOH when calculating the neutralization because it's a weak acid and the solution is strongly basic, so its H+ is negligible compared to the strong acid and the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible, and the initial calculation holds, leading to pH 12.62.

Wait, another angle: when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.08 mol H+, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will neutralize the CH3COOH, which is 0.05 mol. So, 0.05 mol OH- reacts, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L, leading to [OH-] ≈ 0.0416667 M, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH = 12.62.

So, option A is correct.

Wait, but what if the CH3COOH reacts with the excess OH-? That's exactly what I did. So, the OH- first neutralizes the H+ from HCl, then from CH3COOH, and any remaining OH- determines the pH.

So, the correct answer is A)12.62.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (HCl and CH₃COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

### 1. Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:
- **HCl (strong acid):**  
  Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

- **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since CH₃COOH is weak, its contribution of H⁺ is negligible compared to HCl, so it is treated separately.

- **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### 2. Neutralization reactions:
- The OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ reacts with the H⁺ from HCl:  
  \[
  \text{H⁺ (from HCl)} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
  \]  
  Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
  After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ remains.

- The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
  \[
  \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
  \]  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).  
  After neutralization, \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ remains.

### 3. Calculate [OH⁻] and pH:
- Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
  \[
  [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- pOH = \( -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
  pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to **Option A**.

Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. The volumes and concentrations are given for each. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base there is in total and see if they neutralize each other, and what's left after that.

Let me jot down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

Wait, I should probably calculate the total moles of each acid and base first. Because when you mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2OH^-. So I need to account for that.

Moles of CH3COOH: Molarity × Volume (in liters)
0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But wait, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix these, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl^- ions. So the 0.08 moles of HCl will contribute 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. But wait, in a neutralization reaction, perhaps I can't ignore it. Or maybe because it's a weak acid, the amount of H+ it can donate is less than the strong acid. Hmm, but when mixing with a strong base, perhaps the reaction proceeds differently.

Or perhaps not.

But wait, when you mix all three solutions, the total volume is 500+400+300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Wait, so the total volume is 1.2 liters.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this systematically.

First, calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. So 0.08 H+.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is as follows:

H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So, the total H+ available is 0.08 (from HCl) plus the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so if I have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, it will only dissociate a little, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the acetate ions will react.

1. H+ from HCl reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form water.
2. Any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, all available H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) will react with the OH-.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to proceed.

So, initial moles of H+:

HCl: 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol (but it's a weak acid, so its H+ contribution is less than 0.05 mol. Maybe we can approximate it as negligible compared to the strong acid, but I'm not sure.)

Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol.

So, the reaction would be: H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) + OH- → H2O.

So, the total H+ available is 0.08 (HCl) + (some from CH3COOH). Let's say for now that the CH3COOH contributes x moles of H+.

But wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the net H+ after reaction with OH-.

So, the OH- is 0.18 mol, H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

So, the OH- can neutralize 0.08 mol of H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH- remaining.

But wait, that's not right. Because each mole of OH- neutralizes one mole of H+.

So, 0.08 mol H+ (HCl) reacts with 0.08 mol OH- (Ba(OH)2), leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

But then, the remaining OH- (0.10 mol) will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the OH- will deprotonate it, producing CH3COO^-.

The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the OH- will neutralize some of the CH3COOH.

So, moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH- left after HCl reaction: 0.10 mol.

So, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So, the OH- can neutralize 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, because that's all there is.

So, after this reaction, all the CH3COOH would be converted to CH3COO^- and water, and any remaining OH- would be whatever is left after that.

Wait, so 0.10 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, consuming all of the CH3COOH. So, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So now, after all these reactions, the solution has 0.05 mol of OH- left, and the volume is 1.2 L.

Wait, but wait: let's check.

Initial moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Initial moles of OH-: 0.18.

H+ and OH- react 1:1.

So, 0.08 H+ and 0.08 OH- neutralize each other, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, this 0.10 OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 OH- reacts with 0.05 CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 OH-.

So, total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

So, total moles of OH- remaining: 0.05.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, the pOH is -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38 (since log(0.04) is around 1.39794, but let me calculate more accurately).

Wait, 0.0416667 is approximately 4.16667e-2.

Taking log: log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2)
log(4.16667) ≈ 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381.

So pOH ≈ 1.381.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.381 ≈ 12.619.

Wait, that's around 12.62. Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

But wait, am I missing something? Because I thought that after the neutralization, the solution would have excess OH- from the strong base, but perhaps I should consider if the CH3COOH is completely neutralized.

Wait, another thought: when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, the reaction produces CH3COO^-.

So, after the reaction, the solution will have excess OH- from Ba(OH)2, but wait, no. Because I had 0.18 moles OH- initially. After neutralizing 0.08 moles from HCl and 0.05 from CH3COOH, I have 0.05 moles left.

So, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the CH3COOH's contribution of H+.

Because, when CH3COOH is in solution, even before any reaction, it can donate H+ ions. But since the solution also has a lot of OH- from the strong base, perhaps the OH- will first neutralize all the H+ from HCl and then the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, let me think again: the OH- will neutralize the H+ from the strongest acid first, then the weaker. Since HCl is a strong acid, it donates a lot of H+ (0.08 mol), and the OH- (0.18 mol) will first neutralize that. So, 0.08 mol OH- reacts with 0.08 mol HCl, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Since CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, it will react with 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the total OH- in solution is 0.05 mol, in 1.2 L.

So, concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach: perhaps the CH3COOH and HCl are both acting as acids, so their total H+ is 0.08 + (some from CH3COOH). But in the presence of a strong base, maybe the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible, but perhaps I should calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is right, and the pH is 12.62.

Wait, another thought: when you mix the solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L. The moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, I think that because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it will contribute a lot of OH- ions. HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is less, but in the presence of excess OH- from the base, perhaps it doesn't contribute much.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the net H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps another way to approach this is to calculate the total H+ and total OH- in the solution, regardless of their sources.

So, H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol, but since it's weak, let's say it contributes x mol H+.

But when you have a lot of OH- present, the H+ from CH3COOH would react with OH- to form water. So, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible because the OH- is in excess.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the OH- was 0.18, H+ from HCl is 0.08. So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 OH-.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the pH is calculated based on this.

So, the pH comes out to be approximately 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, let's double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the contribution of CH3COOH's H+ before the neutralization.

Wait, because when you mix all the solutions, you have H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the net reaction is H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) + OH- → H2O.

So, the total H+ is from HCl plus the H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so its Ka is about 1.8e-5. The concentration after mixing is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

So, the H+ from CH3COOH can be calculated using the formula for weak acids: [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C).

So,

Ka = 1.8e-5

C = 0.0416667 M.

[H+] = sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.0416667) = sqrt(7.5e-7) ≈ 8.66e-4 M.

Moles of H+ from CH3COOH = 0.0416667 L * 8.66e-4 M ≈ 3.61e-5 mol.

So, the H+ from CH3COOH is about 3.6e-5 mol, which is much less than the 0.08 mol from HCl.

So, when the OH- (0.18 mol) reacts with the H+ (0.08 + 3.6e-5 ≈ 0.080036 mol), the OH- will neutralize all of it, leaving 0.18 - 0.080036 ≈ 0.100 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- is 0.100 mol. But wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Wait, because when I considered the CH3COOH, I thought that after neutralizing the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, the OH- was 0.05 mol.

But wait, that approach may have been wrong. Let me recalculate.

So, the OH- is 0.18 mol.

The H+ is 0.08 (HCl) + 3.6e-5 (CH3COOH) ≈ 0.080036.

So, the OH- will neutralize all of this H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.080036 ≈ 0.099964 mol OH-.

Wait, but that's about 0.10 mol OH-.

Now, what's left is 0.10 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.10 / 1.2 ≈ 0.083333 M.

pOH = -log(0.083333) ≈ 1.08.

So, pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) 12.62, B)1.38, etc.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should not include the H+ from CH3COOH because the solution is strongly basic due to the presence of OH- from Ba(OH)2, so the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible.

So, perhaps the initial calculation where after neutralizing H+ from HCl, the OH- is 0.10 mol, then that OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 mol.

So, the OH- (0.10 mol) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 mol), neutralizing it, and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which is option A.

But earlier, when I included the H+ from CH3COOH, I got a pH of about 12.92, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the H+ from CH3COOH when calculating the neutralization because it's a weak acid and the solution is strongly basic, so its H+ is negligible compared to the strong acid and the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible, and the initial calculation holds, leading to pH 12.62.

Wait, another angle: when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.08 mol H+, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will neutralize the CH3COOH, which is 0.05 mol. So, 0.05 mol OH- reacts, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L, leading to [OH-] ≈ 0.0416667 M, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH = 12.62.

So, option A is correct.

Wait, but what if the CH3COOH reacts with the excess OH-? That's exactly what I did. So, the OH- first neutralizes the H+ from HCl, then from CH3COOH, and any remaining OH- determines the pH.

So, the correct answer is A)12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (HCl and CH₃COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

### 1. Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:
- **HCl (strong acid):**  
  Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

- **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Since CH₃COOH is weak, its contribution of H⁺ is negligible compared to HCl, so it is treated separately.

- **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### 2. Neutralization reactions:
- The OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ reacts with the H⁺ from HCl:  
  \[
  \text{H⁺ (from HCl)} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
  \]  
  Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
  After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ remains.

- The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
  \[
  \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
  \]  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), and moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).  
  After neutralization, \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ remains.

### 3. Calculate [OH⁻] and pH:
- Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
  \[
  [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- pOH = \( -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
  pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to **Option A**.
