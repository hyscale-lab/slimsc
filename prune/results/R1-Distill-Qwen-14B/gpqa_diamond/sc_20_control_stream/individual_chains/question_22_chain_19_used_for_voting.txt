Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically.

Wait, the question gives an incomplete statement: "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." And I need to choose the correct combination from the options A to D, which involve terms like weaker/stronger and faster/slower.

I remember that for redox reactions, the thermodynamic favorability and kinetic rates are two different aspects. So, I'll need to think about both.

First, the thermodynamic part. I think about standard reduction potentials. In basic solutions, the pH is higher, so I should consider how that affects the potential. Oxygen is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, the O2 reduction is more favorable because H+ ions are present. But wait, in basic conditions, the medium is different. The reaction of O2 would involve OH- ions instead of H+. Let me write down the possible reactions.

In acidic solution, the reduction of O2 is:
O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. The standard E° for this is around +1.23 V.

In basic solution, the same reaction would adjust because OH- is present. The reaction becomes:
O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- . The standard E° here is the same as the acidic case because it's the same reaction adjusted for pH. But wait, does that mean the thermodynamic favorability is the same? Or does the solution's pH affect whether the reaction is spontaneous?

Wait, no, the E° values are measured under standard conditions, which are 1M concentrations and 25°C. So in basic solution, the concentration of OH- is high. The cell potential under non-standard conditions can be calculated using the Nernst equation.

But the question is about thermodynamic favorability. So, in basic solutions, is O2 a stronger oxidant than in acidic? I think in acidic, it's a stronger oxidant because the H+ concentration is higher, which the reaction uses. Wait, but the standard E° is the same because it's just the same reaction in different pH. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up terms here.

Wait, perhaps the strength of the oxidant refers to the tendency to be reduced. A stronger oxidant has a higher reduction potential. Since E° is the same, maybe the strength is the same? Or does the medium (acidic vs basic) affect it?

Alternatively, maybe the effective strength as an oxidant is higher in acidic solutions because the reaction tends to proceed more readily due to the presence of H+ ions. But I'm not entirely sure.

Now, the kinetic part. Kinetics refers to the rate of reaction. Even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it might not proceed quickly if the activation energy is high.

In acidic solutions, how does the reaction of O2 proceed? I think that in acidic conditions, the reaction might involve H+ and water, which could lower the activation energy. Or maybe it's the opposite.

I remember something about the rate of O2 reactions. In acidic solutions, the reaction might be faster because the H+ ions can help stabilize transition states or participate in the mechanism. For example, in the oxygen reduction in acidic conditions, there are typically more protons around, which could facilitate the reaction steps. So, maybe the reaction is faster in acidic solutions.

Putting this together: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions? Or is it the same strength because E° is same, but maybe the actual tendency is influenced by pH.

Wait, no. The standard reduction potential for O2 is the same in both cases when adjusted for pH because E° depends on the reaction as written. But in reality, the reaction's feasibility can change. Wait, when you have a higher pH, the concentration of H+ decreases. So, the Nernst equation would come into play.

Let me think about the cell potential in a basic solution. For the O2 reduction in basic, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-.

The Nernst equation would be E = E° - (RT)/(nF) ln(Q). But at standard conditions, it's the same. But when the solution is basic, the OH^- concentration is higher. How does that affect the reaction's tendency?

Alternatively, maybe the strength as an oxidant (thermodynamic) is the same because the E° is same, but in basic conditions, the oxidizing power is influenced differently.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the question is about whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic, thermodynamically.

Another concept I remember is that in basic conditions, the oxidizing power of O2 might be higher because OH- is a better leaving group or something like that. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic is +1.23 V. In basic solution, the same reaction would have a different E°, or is it adjusted?

Wait, no, the E° is measured under standard conditions (1 M concentrations for all ions). So in basic solution, the concentration of OH- is 1 M, so the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-. The E° for this reaction is the same as the acidic case because it's just the same reaction written with OH- instead of H+. So in terms of standard E°, both are the same.

But when you're in a basic solution, say pH is higher than 7, the actual E (not E°) would change because the concentration of H+ is lower, and OH- is higher. So using the Nernst equation, the cell potential might be different.

Wait, but the question is about thermodynamic, which relates to the E°. Or is it about whether the reaction is more favorable in one solution?

Wait, no. Thermodynamic favorability is about whether the reaction is spontaneous. So, if the E is positive, the reaction is spontaneous.

In acidic solution, the O2 reduction is more favorable because H+ is present, but in basic solution, perhaps it's less favorable. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the standard E is the same, but in basic conditions, the actual E might be higher because OH- can make the reaction more favorable under certain conditions.

Wait, let's think about the Nernst equation for the O2 reduction in acidic and basic.

In acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/4) log(Q).

In basic solution, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-. Nernst equation here would involve the concentration of OH^-.

But I'm trying to figure out whether, under the same conditions (like same temperature and concentrations), O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic or acidic.

Wait, if I consider a solution with a certain pH, say pH 7, which is neutral. In that case, for both reactions, the concentrations of H+ and OH- are the same as 1e-7. But in a basic solution, OH- is higher, H+ is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the E for the basic reaction is higher because the product (OH^-) is more concentrated, but I'm not sure how that affects the cell potential.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about other factors. For example, in acidic solution, the O2 reduction is more kinetically favorable because the reaction steps involve H+ and H2O, which have lower activation energy. So, even though thermodynamically it's the same, the reaction proceeds faster in acidic.

So, putting this together, the question is about thermodynamic and kinetic aspects.

- Thermodynamic: Is O2 a stronger oxidant in basic or acidic?

Wait, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its reduction potential. If E° is the same, then it's the same strength. But wait, are the E° values adjusted for the solution?

No, because the E° is the same for the same reaction regardless of the solution's pH, but when the reaction is written for a different pH, the E° would change.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard E for O2 in acidic and basic solutions. From what I remember, the standard E for O2 in acidic is about +1.23 V. In basic, the same reaction's E° is also +0.401 V. Wait, that's conflicting. Because I think that the basic solution E° is lower.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

When you have a redox reaction, the E° depends on the specific reaction equation. So for the O2 reduction in acidic:

O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O ; E° = +1.23 V.

In basic solution, the same reaction would involve OH-:

O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- ; E° is the same as the acidic case? Or is it different?

Wait, no. The E° for the reaction in basic solution would be different because the reaction is written differently. Let me calculate the E° for the basic reaction.

In acidic solution, E°(O2) is +1.23 V. The reaction in basic would have the same E° if we adjust it. Alternatively, the E° for the basic reaction is also +1.23 V when conditions are standard. But that can't be right because the concentrations of H+ and OH- are different.

Wait, no. The standard E° is determined under standard conditions, which are 1 M for each ion involved. So in the acidic reaction, [H+] is 1 M. In the basic reaction, [OH-] is 1 M. Let me calculate the E for the basic reaction under standard conditions.

But wait, the standard E° for the basic reaction can be calculated using the Nernst equation in acidic conditions and then adjusting.

Alternatively, perhaps the E° for the O2 reduction in basic is higher. Because in basic solution, the oxygen is more likely to stay as O2^−, perhaps making the reaction more favorable.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about Le Chatelier's principle. If the solution is more basic, does that shift the O2 reduction reaction to be more favorable?

Alternatively, perhaps the O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic because, in basic, the reaction is less likely to proceed.

Wait, I'm not making progress on the thermodynamic part. Let me think about the kinetic part first.

In acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 tends to proceed faster. Because in acidic conditions, the concentration of H+ is higher, which can facilitate the reaction steps. The reaction might have a lower activation energy in acidic because H+ can stabilize intermediates or transition states.

So, kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

That would suggest that the second blank is filled with "faster".

Now, the first part: thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions. Or is it weaker?

Wait, if in acidic solutions the reaction is kinetically faster, but perhaps thermodynamically not as favorable?

Wait, no. The thermodynamic favorability is determined by the E°. If the E° is higher, the reaction is more spontaneous.

Wait, but if the E° in basic is lower than in acidic, then oxygen would be a weaker oxidant in basic. Alternatively, if the E° is higher in basic, it's a stronger oxidant.

Wait, let me try to calculate the E° for the basic reaction.

The reaction in acidic is: O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O ; E°= +1.23 V.

The reaction in basic would involve OH-: O2 + 2H2O +4e^- → 4OH^-.

We can write this as:

O2 + 2H2O → 4OH^- +4e^- (oxidation, but that's the reverse of reduction).

Wait, no, the reduction is when O2 gains electrons. So the reduction would be O2 + 2H2O +4e^- → 4OH^-.

To find E° for this, we can use the relation between the two reactions.

The E° for the basic reaction can be found using the E° for the acidic reaction and the autoionization of water.

The autoionization of water is H2O ↔ H+ + OH^-; K_w = 1e-14.

The overall reaction can be considered by adding the acidic O2 reduction and the reverse of the autoionization.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula to convert E° from acidic to basic.

The general approach is:

E°(basic) = E°(acidic) - (0.0592 V / n) * log ( [OH-]^m / [H+]^p )

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the Nernst equation.

Alternatively, the E° for the basic reaction can be calculated using the standard potentials for the two half-reactions involved.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the basic solution reaction can be derived from the acidic by adding OH-.

Let me write the reduction in acidic and then adjust for basic.

The acidic reduction is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O ; E°=+1.23 V.

In basic solution, H+ is replaced by H2O and OH-.

So, the reaction becomes:

O2 + 2H2O +4e^- →4OH^-.

To find E° for this reaction, we can use the relation between the two.

The E° for the basic reaction can be determined using the equation:

E°(basic) = E°(acid) - (0.0592 V / n) * log ( [OH-]^4 / [H+]^4 )

Under standard conditions (1M H+ and 1M OH-), since Kw = 1e-14, but for standard conditions, the concentrations are 1 M each for H+ and OH-? No, because in basic solution, [OH-] is 1 M, and [H+] is 1e-14.

Wait, standard conditions for the basic reaction would have [OH-] =1 M and [H+] =1e-14 (since pH + pOH=14).

So, plugging into the equation:

E°(basic) = 1.23 V - (0.0592/4) * log( (1)^4 / (1e-14)^4 )

Because in the expression, [OH-] is in the numerator and [H+] is in the denominator.

So,

log( (1)/( (1e-14)^4 ) ) = log( 1e56 ) = 56.

E°(basic) = 1.23 - (0.0148) * 56.

0.0148 *56 = approx 0.8288.

So,

E°(basic) = 1.23 - 0.8288 ≈ 0.4012 V.

So, the E° for the basic reaction is about 0.40 V, which is lower than the 1.23 V in acidic. So, the thermodynamic favorability is lower in basic conditions. That means that, as an oxidant, O2 is stronger in acidic conditions because it has a higher E°, making it a stronger oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the question is about thermodynamic in basic solutions. So, thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions? Because E° is lower.

Wait, but the question says "thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So, the blank is filled with either stronger or weaker.

Since the E° is lower in basic, the oxidant is weaker. So, first part is weaker.

Wait, no. Wait, the E° is the tendency to be reduced. So, a higher E° means a stronger oxidant because it's more likely to gain electrons (be reduced).

So, in acidic solution, E° is higher, so O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic than in basic.

Wait, but the question says "in basic solutions", so the first part is about being a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic. So in basic, the E° is lower (0.40 V) compared to acidic (1.23 V). So O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

So, the first blank is filled with weaker.

The second part is about kinetic in acidic. As I thought earlier, the reaction is faster in acidic.

So, the second blank is filled with faster.

Looking back at the options:

A) stronger – faster → no, first part is weaker.

B) stronger – slower → no.

C) weaker – faster → yes, this matches.

D) weaker - slower → no.

So, the correct answer is option C.

To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, considering both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects.

### Thermodynamic Analysis
The thermodynamic favorability of a reaction is determined by the standard reduction potential ($E^\circ$). For oxygen reduction:
- In acidic solutions, the reaction is:  
  $$\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \, E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V}.$$
- In basic solutions, the reaction is:  
  $$\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \, E^\circ = +0.401 \, \text{V}.$$

The $E^\circ$ value is lower in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions. A lower $E^\circ$ indicates that oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions thermodynamically.

### Kinetic Analysis
Kinetics refers to the rate of reaction. In acidic solutions, the presence of $\text{H}^+$ ions facilitates the reaction steps, lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the absence of $\text{H}^+$ ions and the involvement of $\text{OH}^-$ ions can slow down the reaction. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster kinetically in acidic solutions.

### Combining the Results
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

### Correct Option
The correct combination is **weaker – faster**, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the question is about whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic, thermodynamically.

In acidic solution, E°(O2) is +1.23 V. The reaction in basic would have the same E° if we adjust it. Alternatively, the E° for the basic reaction is also +1.23 V when conditions are standard. But that can't be right because the concentrations of H+ and OH- are different.

Wait, no. The standard E° is determined under standard conditions, which are 1 M for each ion involved. So in the acidic reaction, [H+] is 1 M. In the basic reaction, [OH-] is 1 M. Let me calculate the E for the basic reaction under standard conditions.

But wait, the standard E° for the basic reaction can be calculated using the Nernst equation in acidic conditions and then adjusting.

Alternatively, perhaps the E° for the O2 reduction in basic is higher. Because in basic solution, the oxygen is more likely to stay as O2^−, perhaps making the reaction more favorable.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about Le Chatelier's principle. If the solution is more basic, does that shift the O2 reduction reaction to be more favorable?

Alternatively, perhaps the O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic because, in basic, the reaction is less likely to proceed.

Wait, I'm not making progress on the thermodynamic part. Let me think about the kinetic part first.

In acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 tends to proceed faster. Because in acidic conditions, the concentration of H+ is higher, which can facilitate the reaction steps. The reaction might have a lower activation energy in acidic because H+ can stabilize intermediates or transition states.

Wait, no. The thermodynamic favorability is determined by the E°. If the E° is higher, the reaction is more spontaneous.

Wait, but if the E° in basic is lower than in acidic, then oxygen would be a weaker oxidant in basic. Alternatively, if the E° is higher in basic, it's a stronger oxidant.

Wait, let me try to calculate the E° for the basic reaction.

The reaction in acidic is: O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O ; E°= +1.23 V.

The reaction in basic would involve OH-: O2 + 2H2O +4e^- → 4OH^-.

We can write this as:

O2 + 2H2O → 4OH^- +4e^- (oxidation, but that's the reverse of reduction).

Wait, no, the reduction is when O2 gains electrons. So the reduction would be O2 + 2H2O +4e^- → 4OH^-.

To find E° for this, we can use the relation between the two reactions.

The E° for the basic reaction can be found using the E° for the acidic reaction and the autoionization of water.

The autoionization of water is H2O ↔ H+ + OH^-; K_w = 1e-14.

The overall reaction can be considered by adding the acidic O2 reduction and the reverse of the autoionization.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula to convert E° from acidic to basic.

The general approach is:

E°(basic) = E°(acidic) - (0.0592 V / n) * log ( [OH-]^m / [H+]^p )

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the Nernst equation.

Alternatively, the E° for the basic reaction can be calculated using the standard potentials for the two half-reactions involved.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the basic solution reaction can be derived from the acidic by adding OH-.

Let me write the reduction in acidic and then adjust for basic.

The acidic reduction is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O ; E°=+1.23 V.

In basic solution, H+ is replaced by H2O and OH-.

So, the reaction becomes:

O2 + 2H2O +4e^- →4OH^-.

To find E° for this reaction, we can use the relation between the two.

The E° for the basic reaction can be determined using the equation:

E°(basic) = E°(acid) - (0.0592 V / n) * log ( [OH-]^4 / [H+]^4 )

Under standard conditions (1M H+ and 1M OH-), since Kw = 1e-14, but for standard conditions, the concentrations are 1 M each for H+ and OH-? No, because in basic solution, [OH-] is 1 M, and [H+] is 1e-14.

Wait, standard conditions for the basic reaction would have [OH-] =1 M and [H+] =1e-14 (since pH + pOH=14).

So, plugging into the equation:

E°(basic) = 1.23 V - (0.0592/4) * log( (1)^4 / (1e-14)^4 )

Because in the expression, [OH-] is in the numerator and [H+] is in the denominator.

So,

log( (1)/( (1e-14)^4 ) ) = log( 1e56 ) = 56.

E°(basic) = 1.23 - (0.0148) * 56.

0.0148 *56 = approx 0.8288.

So,

E°(basic) = 1.23 - 0.8288 ≈ 0.4012 V.

So, the E° for the basic reaction is about 0.40 V, which is lower than the 1.23 V in acidic. So, the thermodynamic favorability is lower in basic conditions. That means that, as an oxidant, O2 is stronger in acidic conditions because it has a higher E°, making it a stronger oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the question is about thermodynamic in basic solutions. So, thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions? Because E° is lower.

Wait, but the question says "thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So, the blank is filled with either stronger or weaker.

Since the E° is lower in basic, the oxidant is weaker. So, first part is weaker.

Wait, no. Wait, the E° is the tendency to be reduced. So, a higher E° means a stronger oxidant because it's more likely to gain electrons (be reduced).

So, in acidic solution, E° is higher, so O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic than in basic.

Wait, but the question says "in basic solutions", so the first part is about being a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic. So in basic, the E° is lower (0.40 V) compared to acidic (1.23 V). So O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

So, the first blank is filled with weaker.

The second part is about kinetic in acidic. As I thought earlier, the reaction is faster in acidic.

So, the second blank is filled with faster.

Looking back at the options:

A) stronger – faster → no, first part is weaker.

B) stronger – slower → no.

C) weaker – faster → yes, this matches.

D) weaker - slower → no.

So, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, considering both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects.

### Thermodynamic Analysis
The thermodynamic favorability of a reaction is determined by the standard reduction potential ($E^\circ$). For oxygen reduction:
- In acidic solutions, the reaction is:  
  $$\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \, E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V}.$$
- In basic solutions, the reaction is:  
  $$\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \, E^\circ = +0.401 \, \text{V}.$$

The $E^\circ$ value is lower in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions. A lower $E^\circ$ indicates that oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions thermodynamically.

### Kinetic Analysis
Kinetics refers to the rate of reaction. In acidic solutions, the presence of $\text{H}^+$ ions facilitates the reaction steps, lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the absence of $\text{H}^+$ ions and the involvement of $\text{OH}^-$ ions can slow down the reaction. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster kinetically in acidic solutions.

### Combining the Results
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

### Correct Option
The correct combination is **weaker – faster**, which corresponds to **Option C**.
