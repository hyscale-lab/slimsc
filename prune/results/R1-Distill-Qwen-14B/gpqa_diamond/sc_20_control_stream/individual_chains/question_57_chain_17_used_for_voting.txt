Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, right? The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And it says to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider these five. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure yet how that plays into the calculation.

The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * sum [ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / (1 - e^{-i δ_l}) ) ] ... wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, from what I recall, the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of the phase shifts is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) ) / (k R sinθ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / ( sin(δ_l) ) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: I think the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / sin δ_l ), but perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, I've heard that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the cross sections, but maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the total scattering cross-section. Oh wait, no, the question is specifically about the imaginary part in the direction along the incident beam. That would be θ=0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle is zero.

Wait, but the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a function of θ. So when θ approaches zero, maybe the expression simplifies. I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude evaluated at the direction along the beam, which is θ=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the optical theorem, which relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. Oh wait, that's a possibility. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/ k²) times the imaginary part of f(0), where k is the wave number. So if I can find Im(f(0)), I can find σ_total, but wait, the problem isn't asking for the cross-section; it's asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, but the question gives the phase shifts, so perhaps the approach is to compute Im(f(0)) using the phase shifts. Let's think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ] ) / (k * (something)) ) * (something else...)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look up the exact formula. I'm remembering that the scattering amplitude f for each partial wave l is given by:

f_l(k, θ) = ( (2l + 1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ] )/( (2ik) R sin δ_l ) )

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, I think the correct expression is:

f_l(θ) = ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / (k R sin δ_l )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another thought: when θ=0, cosθ = 1, so maybe the amplitude simplifies. Also, for each l, the angular dependence is something like (sin^l (θ/2)) etc., but perhaps when θ=0, this becomes zero for l>0. Wait, no, because for l=0, the Legendre polynomial P0=1, so perhaps the dominant term at θ=0 is the l=0 term.

But wait, the problem gives phase shifts up to l=4. So perhaps I should sum over all the partial waves, each contributing to the amplitude at θ=0.

Wait, but the problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam, which is θ=0. So I think we can model f(0) as the sum over l of contributions from each l, evaluated at θ=0.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / ( sin δ_l ) ) * (sin(lθ)/sinθ) )

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, for θ=0, the sin(lθ) would be zero for any l>0. Hmm, that's a problem because that would make each term zero except possibly l=0. But wait, for l=0, sin(0) is zero, but perhaps we can take the limit as θ approaches zero.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the formula for the scattering amplitude again. The general expression is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^{∞} ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} ( e^{i δ_l} - 1 ) ) / (k R sin δ_l) ) * ( (sin( (l+1)θ/2 )) / ( sin(θ/2) ) ) )

Hmm, perhaps that's the right formula. So when θ is zero, what's the value of this sum?

Wait, but when θ approaches zero, sin(θ/2) ~ θ/2, and sin( (l+1)θ/2 ) ~ (l+1)θ/2. So each term becomes ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ) / (k R sin δ_l ) ) * ( (l+1)θ/2 ) / (θ/2 ) ) = (2l+1)(l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) / ( 2 k R sin δ_l ) )

Wait, but θ cancels out, so each term is proportional to (2l+1)(l+1). But when θ is exactly zero, I'm not sure if this approach holds, because each term would have a 0/0 form. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the leading term for small θ is given by the l=0 term.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. So perhaps we can model f(0) as the sum over all l of ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / ( 2ik ) ) * something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is using the fact that the imaginary part of f(0) is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total

But wait, the problem isn't giving me the cross-section, so perhaps that's not the way to go. Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the imaginary part of the sum of the partial waves evaluated at θ=0.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the partial waves as:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} ( e^{i δ_l} - 1 ) ) / ( 2i k (1 - e^{2i δ_l}) ) ) * (some angular dependence )

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the partial wave amplitude for each l is f_l = ( e^{2i δ_l} ( e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ) / ( 2i k (1 - e^{2i δ_l}) )

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. Let me think again about the problem statement.

The measured phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and others are ignored. The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0°.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] / sin δ_l ) * (sin((l+1)θ/2) / sin(θ/2) )

At θ=0, the denominator sin(θ/2) tends to zero, but each term's numerator sin((l+1)θ/2) also tends to zero. So perhaps we can take the limit as θ approaches zero. For small θ, sin x ≈ x, so sin((l+1)θ/2) ≈ (l+1)θ/2, and sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2. So the ratio becomes (l+1).

Thus, each term becomes approximately ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ) / ( 2ik sin δ_l ) ) * (l+1) * (θ/2) ) / (θ/2) ), which simplifies to ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) (l+1) ) / (2ik sin δ_l ) )

Wait, but when θ approaches zero, the amplitude should approach f(0), and each term is multiplied by (l+1). But this seems to suggest that each term scales with l+1, which for higher l could be significant. But perhaps the problem expects us to compute each term and sum them up.

Wait, but let's think about the imaginary part of f(0). Since f(θ) is a complex quantity, its imaginary part is the imaginary part of the sum of all the partial waves evaluated at θ=0.

So, for each l, the contribution to Im(f(0)) is Im( f_l ), where f_l is the partial wave amplitude evaluated at θ=0.

Wait, but how to compute f_l at θ=0. Another approach: perhaps in the limit as θ approaches zero, the amplitude f(θ) can be written as f(0) + something proportional to θ^2, so the leading term is f(0). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the imaginary part of f(0) is equal to the sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ) / (2k) ) * (something). Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look up the formula.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / sin δ_l * (sin((l+1)θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) )

So, at θ=0, each term's sin((l+1)θ/2) is zero, but the denominator is also zero. So perhaps we can use L’Hospital's rule or expand in terms of small θ.

Taking the limit as θ approaches zero:

sin((l+1)θ/2) ≈ (l+1)θ/2 - [(l+1)^3 θ^3]/48 + ...
sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2 - θ^3/(48) + ...

So, the ratio sin((l+1)θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ≈ [ (l+1)θ/2 ] / [θ/2] ] = l+1, when θ is very small.

So, for small θ, the amplitude f(θ) ≈ f(0) + ... where f(0) is given by (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) (l+1) / sin δ_l )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the leading term at θ=0 is just the l=0 term, because higher l terms may vanish faster as θ approaches zero. Let me think: for each l, the term (sin((l+1)θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) becomes (l+1) when θ is very small. So, the amplitude f(0) would be the sum over all l of [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) (l+1) ] / (2ik sin δ_l )

But wait, that's a lot of terms. Let's compute each term for l=0 to 4.

Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. The imaginary part of f(0) can be found using the formula:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l )

Wait, I'm not confident about this formula either. Alternatively, let me look for a formula that directly gives Im(f(0)).

Wait, I think I found a formula in my notes: Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because at θ=0, the amplitude is given by:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / sin δ_l ) * ( ... )

Wait, when θ=0, the angular part becomes (sin( (l+1)*0/2 )) / sin(0/2) ), which is 0/0, so perhaps we can take the limit as θ approaches zero. Using the expansion I did before, each term contributes (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1 )) / (2ik sin δ_l ) ) * (l+1)

But the imaginary part of f(0) would then be the sum over l of Im[ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1 )) (l+1) )/(2ik sin δ_l) ) ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to compute each term for l=0 to l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a simpler expression.

Wait, another idea: the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) )/( (1 - e^{2i δ_l}) ) ) * (something)

Wait, I think I'm mixing up different expressions here. Maybe I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion and compute each term.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) sin(2 δ_l )

This formula seems familiar. Let me check: for each l, the term would be (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) summed over all l, multiplied by 1/(2k).

If this is correct, then I can compute each term for l=0 to l=4, sum them, and multiply by 1/(2k).

Wait, but what is k? k is the wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to compute k in appropriate units. Let me think about units: 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

The electron mass is m_e = about 0.511 MeV/c². But since the energy is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, maybe we can use the relativistic approximation for k.

In high-energy (ultrarelativistic) limit, the relation between energy E and momentum p is E ≈ pc. So, p = E/c ≈ 50 MeV / c.

But wait, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ. Let me compute k.

First, let me compute ħ in MeV·fm.

We know that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, but perhaps I can compute k as follows.

E = 50 MeV. Since E ≈ pc, p = E / c. Wait, but for units, using E in MeV, p would be in MeV/c.

But when calculating k = p / ħ, we can write:

k = ( p ) / ħ = (E/(c)) / ( ħ / c ) ) ) = E/( ħ c )

Wait, because p = E/(c) when E is much larger than m c². So, k = (E/(c)) / ( ħ / (c) ) ) = E / ( ħ c )

So, since ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = E / ( ħ c ) = 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV·fm ≈ 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, so k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/(2k) is 1/(2 * 0.253) ≈ 1/(0.506) ≈ 1.976 fm.

Wait, that's interesting. So each term in the sum is (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), and then multiplied by 1.976 fm.

So, let's compute each term for l=0 to l=4:

l=0: (2*0 +1) =1. δ₀=90°, sin(2*90°)=sin(180°)=0. So term is 1 * 0 = 0.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ₁=67°, sin(134°)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193. So term=3*0.7193≈2.158.

l=2: (2*2+1)=5. δ₂=55°, sin(110°)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397. So term=5 * 0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: (2*3+1)=7. δ₃=30°, sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660. So term=7 * 0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9. δ₄=13°, sin(26°)=approx 0.4384. So term=9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum these terms:

l=0: 0

l=1: 2.158

l=2: 4.6985 → total so far: 6.8565

l=3: 6.062 → total: 12.9185

l=4: 3.9456 → total: 16.8641

Now multiply by 1/(2k) which we found to be approximately 1.976 fm.

So 16.8641 * 1.976 ≈ let's compute that.

16.8641 * 2 = 33.7282, but since it's 1.976, which is 2 - 0.024, so 16.8641*(2-0.024) = 33.7282 - (16.8641 * 0.024).

16.8641 * 0.024 = 0.4047384.

So 33.7282 - 0.4047384 ≈ 33.3235.

Wait, but wait, 16.8641 * 1.976 = ?

Alternatively, compute 16.8641 * 1.976.

Let me compute 16.8641 * 1.976:

1.976 is approximately 2 - 0.024.

But to compute more accurately:

16.8641 * 1.976 = 16.8641 * (2 - 0.024) = (16.8641 * 2) - (16.8641 * 0.024).

=33.7282 - (0.4047384) = 33.3234616 ≈33.3235.

Wait, but let me double-check with exact multiplication.

16.8641 × 1.976:

Compute 16 × 1.976 = 31.616

0.8641 × 1.976: Let's compute 0.8 * 1.976 = 1.5808, 0.06 *1.976=0.11856, 0.0041 *1.976≈0.0081016.

Adding up: 1.5808 + 0.11856 = 1.69936 + 0.0081016 ≈1.70746.

So total is 31.616 +1.70746 = 33.32346.

So Im(f(0)) ≈33.3235 fm.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the closest is option A) 87163.4 fm, which is way higher. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a minute, perhaps my assumption about the formula is incorrect. Maybe I should think again.

Wait, when I used the formula Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), and calculated it, I got approximately 33.3235 fm. But that's nowhere near any of the options given.

The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but let's test this. For l=0, sin(90)=1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: 3 sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 sin30≈7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin13≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum: 1 + 2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

Multiply by 1/k = 1/(0.253 fm⁻¹) ≈ 3.9526 fm.

So 13.382 *3.9526 ≈ 52.8.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ) / (2ik) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each term's imaginary part.

Wait, for a general term in the sum, each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / (2ik sin δ_l )

So the imaginary part of each term is Im[ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / (2ik sin δ_l ) ]

Let me compute this for each l.

Let me compute the numerator as (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) = (2l+1) [ e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ]

So the term becomes (2l+1) (e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ) / (2ik sin δ_l )

We can write this as (2l+1)/(2ik sin δ_l) ) * ( e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} )

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1)/(2k sin δ_l) ) * Im( e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} )

Im(e^{i θ}) = sinθ, so:

Im( e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ) = sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l )

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) ( sin(2 δ_l) - sin δ_l ) / ( 2k sin δ_l )

So, Im(f_l) = (2l+1) ( sin(2 δ_l) - sin δ_l ) / ( 2k sin δ_l )

Let me compute this for each l.

First, compute each term:

l=0: δ=90°, sin(90)=1, sin(180)=0.

Im(f_0) = (1) (0 -1 ) / (2k *1 ) ) = (-1)/(2k )

But wait, that would be negative. But perhaps I'm not considering the correct signs.

Wait, but let me compute:

sin(2δ) = sin(180°) =0.

So, (0 -1) = -1.

So, Im(f_0)= (1) * (-1) / (2k *1 ) = -1/(2k)

But this is just one term; let's compute the others.

l=1: δ=67°, sin(67)≈0.9205.

sin(2δ)= sin(134)= sin(46)=0.7193.

So, (0.7193 -0.9205)= -0.2012.

Im(f_1)= 3*(-0.2012)/(2k *0.9205 )

= (3*(-0.2012)) / (2k *0.9205 )

= (-0.6036) / (1.841 k )

= approximately -0.328 /k.

l=2: δ=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192.

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

So, 0.9397 -0.8192=0.1205.

Im(f_2)=5*(0.1205)/(2k *0.8192 )

= (0.6025)/(1.6384 k )

≈ 0.6025/(1.6384 *k ) ≈ 0.3677/(k)

l=3: δ=30°, sin(30)=0.5.

sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

0.8660 -0.5=0.3660.

Im(f_3)=7*(0.3660)/(2k *0.5 )

= 7 * 0.3660 / (k )

= 2.562 /k.

l=4: δ=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495.

sin(26)≈0.4384.

0.4384 -0.22495≈0.21345.

Im(f_4)=9*(0.21345)/(2k *0.22495 )

= (1.92105) / (0.4499 k )

≈4.268/(k )

Now, sum all the Im(f_l) for l=0 to l=4:

Im(f_0)= -1/(2k )

Im(f_1)= -0.328 /k

Im(f_2)= 0.3677/k

Im(f_3)= 2.562/k

Im(f_4)=4.268/k

Total Im(f) = [ (-0.5) -0.328 +0.3677 +2.562 +4.268 ] /k

Wait, because Im(f_0)= -1/(2k) = -0.5/k.

So,

-0.5 -0.328 = -0.828

+0.3677 → -0.4603

+2.562 → 2.1017

+4.268 →6.3697.

So total sum is 6.3697/k.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when l=0, the term is negative, but the others are positive. So let me re-calculate:

Wait, no, I think I did this correctly. Let me add them:

-0.5 (from l=0)

-0.328 (l=1) → total -0.828

+0.3677 (l=2) → -0.828 +0.3677 = -0.4603

+2.562 (l=3) → 2.1017

+4.268 (l=4) → 6.3697.

So total is 6.3697/k.

Now, using k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹, so 6.3697 / 0.253 ≈ approximately 25.16 fm.

Wait, that's close to option D) 251.271 fm, but off by a factor of about 10. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recompute k.

The energy is 50 MeV, and since E ≈ pc, p = E/c = 50 MeV/c.

The wave number k = p / ħ.

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm ) / c.

But when calculating p = E/c, and k = p/ħ, substituting ħ:

k = (E/(c)) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm )/(c) ) ) = E / (197.33 MeV·fm )

So, k = (50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) = 50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that part is correct.

So, Im(f) =6.3697 / 0.253 ≈25.16 fm.

But none of the options are around 25 fm. The closest is option D, which is 251.271 fm. So that's a factor of 10 difference. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im(f_l). Let me re-examine.

Wait, the term I computed for each l is the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude. So the total Im(f) is the sum of all Im(f_l). But wait, the formula I derived earlier may not be correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the correct expression for the imaginary part of f(0) is sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

Wait, but when I tried that earlier, the sum was around 13.38, multiplied by 1/k (approx 3.9526 fm) gives about 52.8 fm, which also doesn't match any options.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different formula for the scattering amplitude, perhaps in terms of the Born approximation or something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the cross-section via the optical theorem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, which is related to the sum of the phase shifts.

Wait, the forward scattering amplitude f(0) can be written as:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / sin δ_l

But when evaluating this, perhaps we can take the imaginary part.

The imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ Im( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / sin δ_l )

The term inside is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / sin δ_l.

Let me rewrite this as (2l+1) [e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ] / ( sin δ_l )

The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) [ sin(2 δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ] / sin δ_l.

So, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin(2 δ_l) - sin δ_l ] / sin δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1.

δ=90°, sin(90)=1.

sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0.

[0 -1 ] /1 = -1.

So term: 1*(-1) = -1.

l=1: δ=67°, sin=0.9205.

sin(2δ)=sin(134)=0.7193.

[0.7193 -0.9205 ] /0.9205 ≈ (-0.2012)/0.9205 ≈-0.2186.

Multiply by (3): 3*(-0.2186)= -0.6558.

l=2: δ=55°, sin=0.8192.

sin(110)=0.9397.

[0.9397 -0.8192]/0.8192 ≈ 0.1205 /0.8192 ≈0.147.

Multiply by 5: 5*0.147≈0.735.

l=3: δ=30°, sin=0.5.

sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

[0.8660-0.5]/0.5 = (0.366)/0.5=0.732.

Multiply by 7: 7*0.732≈5.124.

l=4: δ=13°, sin≈0.22495.

sin(26)=0.4384.

[0.4384 -0.22495]/0.22495 ≈0.2135/0.22495≈0.949.

Multiply by 9: 9*0.949≈8.541.

Now sum all terms:

l=0: -1.

l=1: -0.6558 → sum: -1.6558

l=2: +0.735 → sum: -0.9208

l=3: +5.124 → sum:4.2032

l=4: +8.541 → sum:12.7442.

Now, multiply by 1/(2k) =1/(2*0.253)≈1.976 fm.

So 12.7442 *1.976 ≈ let's compute:

12 *1.976 = 23.712.

0.7442 *1.976 ≈ approx 1.475.

Total ≈23.712 +1.475≈25.187 fm.

Hmm, that's about 25.19 fm. But none of the options are close to that. The closest option is D)251.271 fm, which is about ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula for Im(f(0)).

Wait, I'm getting Im(f(0))=25.19 fm, but the options are higher. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 somewhere in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me re-express k again.

k = E / (ħ c) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹. That seems correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should use the non-relativistic expression for k.

Wait, but 50 MeV is much larger than the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV), so using E≈pc is correct. So k is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires the answer to be in different units. For example, maybe the cross-section is in barns, but the problem states the answer is in fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.

I'm now really stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at zero angle is given by:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] / sin δ_l )

But I need to compute this sum.

Another approach: for each l, compute (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] / sin δ_l, then take the imaginary part and sum.

Let me compute this for each l.

l=0: δ=90°, e^{i90}=i. So e^{iδ}(e^{iδ} -1) =i*(i-1)=i^2 -i = -1 -i.

Divide by sin(90)=1 → -1 -i. The imaginary part is -1.

Multiply by (2l+1)=1 → -1.

l=1: δ=67°, e^{i67} is cos67 +i sin67 ≈0.3907 +i 0.9205.

e^{i67} -1 ≈ (0.3907-1) +i 0.9205 → -0.6093 +i 0.9205.

Multiply by e^{i67}:

(0.3907 +i 0.9205) * (-0.6093 +i 0.9205).

Let me compute this:

Real part: (0.3907)(-0.6093) + (0.9205)(0.9205) = (-0.2379) + 0.8473 → 0.6094.

Imaginary part: (0.3907)(0.9205) + (-0.6093)(0.9205) → (0.360) + (-0.560) → -0.200.

So the product is 0.6094 -0.200 i.

Divide by sin(67)=0.9205:

(0.6094 -0.200 i)/0.9205 → approximately 0.6617 -0.2173 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3 → 1.985 - 0.6519 i.

Imaginary part: -0.6519.

l=2: δ=55°.

e^{i55}=0.5736 +i 0.8192.

e^{i55}-1 ≈-0.4264 +i 0.8192.

Multiply:

(0.5736 +i 0.8192) * (-0.4264 +i 0.8192).

Real part: 0.5736*(-0.4264) + 0.8192*0.8192 ≈ (-0.2445) + 0.6711 → 0.4266.

Imaginary part: 0.5736 *0.8192 + (-0.4264)*0.8192 → 0.4707 - 0.3494 →0.1213.

So product is 0.4266 +0.1213i.

Divide by sin(55)=0.8192 → 0.5207 +0.148 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=5 →2.6035 +0.740 i.

Imaginary part:0.740.

l=3: δ=30°.

e^{i30} =√3/2 + i 0.5 →≈0.8660 +i 0.5.

e^{i30} -1 ≈-0.1340 +i0.5.

Multiply:

(0.8660 +i0.5) * (-0.1340 +i0.5).

Real: 0.8660*(-0.134) + 0.5*0.5 → (-0.1162) +0.25 →0.1338.

Imaginary: 0.8660*0.5 + (-0.134)*0.5 →0.433 -0.067 →0.366.

So product is 0.1338 +i0.366.

Divide by sin(30)=0.5 → 0.2676 +0.732 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=7 →1.873 +5.124 i.

Imaginary part:5.124.

l=4: δ=13°.

e^{i13} ≈0.9744 +i0.22495.

e^{i13} -1 ≈-0.0256 +i0.22495.

Multiply:

(0.9744 +i0.22495) * (-0.0256 +i0.22495).

Real part: 0.9744*(-0.0256) + 0.22495*0.22495 → (-0.02499) +0.0506 →0.0256.

Imaginary part: 0.9744 *0.22495 + (-0.0256)*0.22495 → (0.2192) -0.00576 →0.2134.

So product is 0.0256 +i0.2134.

Divide by sin(13)=0.22495 → 0.1137 +0.948 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=9 →1.0233 +8.532 i.

Imaginary part:8.532.

Now, sum all the imaginary parts:

l=0: -1.

l=1: -0.6519 → total: -1.6519.

l=2: +0.740 → total: -0.9119.

l=3: +5.124 → total:4.2121.

l=4: +8.532 → total:12.7441.

Multiply by 1/(2k) =1/(2*0.253) ≈1.976 fm.

So 12.7441 *1.976 ≈25.18 fm.

Again, same result as before. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should have used k = E/(ħ c) in the correct units. Let me compute ħ c in fm·MeV.

ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = E / (ħ c) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) =50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But perhaps I should calculate k in units of inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers. Let me see.

Wait, no, because the options are in fm, so the calculation should be in consistent units.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the wave number k has units of inverse meters, but in the formula, I'm using it in inverse femtometers. Let me check.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 meters.

So, 1 fm⁻¹ =1e15 m⁻¹.

So, k=0.253 fm⁻¹ = 0.253e15 m⁻¹.

But the calculation of Im(f(0)) is in fm, so when I multiply by 1/k (which is in fm), I need to make sure units are correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the formula for Im(f(0)) is in units of fm, and the calculation is correct, but none of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the Born approximation, which is f = (k/(4π)) (e^{2iδ_0} -1 ) e^{iδ_0}.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ) / ( sin δ_l )

But perhaps for l>0, these terms are negligible, and only l=0 contributes.

Wait, but for l=0, delta is 90 degrees, so e^{i90}=i, and e^{i delta}=i.

So, (e^{i delta}-1)=i-1.

So, (e^{i delta} (e^{i delta}-1 ))=i*(i-1)=i^2 -i= -1 -i.

Divide by sin delta=1, so ( -1 -i ).

Multiply by (2l+1)=1.

So, term is (-1 -i).

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * ( (-1 -i) )

Im(f(0)) is the imaginary part of ( (-1 -i) )/(2ik )

= [ (-i) ]/(2ik )

= [ -1/(2k) ) ].

Which is -1/(2k).

But k=0.253 fm⁻¹, so 1/(2k)=1/(0.506)=1.976 fm.

So, Im(f(0))= -1.976 fm.

But the options are positive, so perhaps I made a sign mistake. Or perhaps only the positive part is considered.

Wait, but this is just the contribution from l=0, and earlier calculations showed that higher l terms add to a larger positive value.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the contribution from l=0.

But in that case, Im(f(0))= -1.976 fm, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I'm not able to reach any of the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. But given the time I've spent, I'll go with the closest option, which is D) 251.271 fm, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum, and the correct answer is option D, which is approximately 251 fm, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived from the partial wave expansion:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \frac{\sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l)}{\sin(\delta_l)}.
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number Calculation**:  
   The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation \( E \approx pc \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \). The value of \( k \) is determined as:
   \[
   k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Imaginary Part Contribution from Each \( l \)**:  
   For each \( l \), the contribution to \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is computed using:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f_l) = \frac{(2l+1)}{2k \sin(\delta_l)} \left[ \sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l) \right].
   \]
   The contributions for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \) are:
   - \( l = 0 \): \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_0) = 0 \), \( \sin(\delta_0) = 1 \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_0) = \frac{1}{2k} \left[ 0 - 1 \right] = -\frac{1}{2k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 1 \): \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_1) = \frac{3}{2k \cdot 0.9205} \left[ 0.7193 - 0.9205 \right] \approx -\frac{0.6558}{k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 2 \): \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_2) = \frac{5}{2k \cdot 0.8192} \left[ 0.9397 - 0.8192 \right] \approx \frac{0.3677}{k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 3 \): \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_3) = \frac{7}{2k \cdot 0.5} \left[ 0.8660 - 0.5 \right] \approx \frac{2.562}{k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 4 \): \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_4) = \frac{9}{2k \cdot 0.22495} \left[ 0.4384 - 0.22495 \right] \approx \frac{4.268}{k}.
     \]

3. **Summing Contributions**:  
   Summing the contributions for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \left[ -1 - 0.6558 + 0.3677 + 2.562 + 4.268 \right].
   \]
   The total inside the brackets is approximately \( 12.744 \). Multiplying by \( \frac{1}{2k} \approx 1.976 \, \text{fm} \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 12.744 \cdot 1.976 \approx 25.19 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( 25.19 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is \( \mathbf{D) \, 251.271 \, \text{fm}} \), which is approximately a factor of 10 higher. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the interpretation of the formula or units.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, right? The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And it says to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider these five. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure yet how that plays into the calculation.

The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * sum [ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / (1 - e^{-i δ_l}) ) ] ... wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, from what I recall, the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of the phase shifts is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) ) / (k R sinθ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / ( sin(δ_l) ) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: I think the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / sin δ_l ), but perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, I've heard that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the cross sections, but maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the total scattering cross-section. Oh wait, no, the question is specifically about the imaginary part in the direction along the incident beam. That would be θ=0 degrees, right? Because the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle is zero.

Wait, but the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a function of θ. So when θ approaches zero, maybe the expression simplifies. I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude evaluated at the direction along the beam, which is θ=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the optical theorem, which relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. Oh wait, that's a possibility. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/ k²) times the imaginary part of f(0), where k is the wave number. So if I can find Im(f(0)), I can find σ_total, but wait, the problem isn't asking for the cross-section; it's asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, but the question gives the phase shifts, so perhaps the approach is to compute Im(f(0)) using the phase shifts. Let's think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ] ) / (k * (something)) ) * (something else...)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look up the exact formula. I'm remembering that the scattering amplitude f for each partial wave l is given by:

f_l(k, θ) = ( (2l + 1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ] )/( (2ik) R sin δ_l ) )

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, I think the correct expression is:

f_l(θ) = ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / (k R sin δ_l )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another thought: when θ=0, cosθ = 1, so maybe the amplitude simplifies. Also, for each l, the angular dependence is something like (sin^l (θ/2)) etc., but perhaps when θ=0, this becomes zero for l>0. Wait, no, because for l=0, the Legendre polynomial P0=1, so perhaps the dominant term at θ=0 is the l=0 term.

But wait, the problem gives phase shifts up to l=4. So perhaps I should sum over all the partial waves, each contributing to the amplitude at θ=0.

Wait, but the problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam, which is θ=0. So I think we can model f(0) as the sum over l of contributions from each l, evaluated at θ=0.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / ( sin δ_l ) ) * (sin(lθ)/sinθ) )

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, for θ=0, the sin(lθ) would be zero for any l>0. Hmm, that's a problem because that would make each term zero except possibly l=0. But wait, for l=0, sin(0) is zero, but perhaps we can take the limit as θ approaches zero.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the formula for the scattering amplitude again. The general expression is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^{∞} ( (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} ( e^{i δ_l} - 1 ) ) / (k R sin δ_l) ) * ( (sin( (l+1)θ/2 )) / ( sin(θ/2) ) ) )

Hmm, perhaps that's the right formula. So when θ is zero, what's the value of this sum?

Wait, but when θ approaches zero, sin(θ/2) ~ θ/2, and sin( (l+1)θ/2 ) ~ (l+1)θ/2. So each term becomes ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ) / (k R sin δ_l ) ) * ( (l+1)θ/2 ) / (θ/2 ) ) = (2l+1)(l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) / ( 2 k R sin δ_l ) )

Wait, but θ cancels out, so each term is proportional to (2l+1)(l+1). But when θ is exactly zero, I'm not sure if this approach holds, because each term would have a 0/0 form. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the leading term for small θ is given by the l=0 term.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. So perhaps we can model f(0) as the sum over all l of ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) / ( 2ik ) ) * something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is using the fact that the imaginary part of f(0) is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total

But wait, the problem isn't giving me the cross-section, so perhaps that's not the way to go. Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the imaginary part of the sum of the partial waves evaluated at θ=0.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the partial waves as:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} ( e^{i δ_l} - 1 ) ) / ( 2i k (1 - e^{2i δ_l}) ) ) * (some angular dependence )

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the partial wave amplitude for each l is f_l = ( e^{2i δ_l} ( e^{i δ_l} -1 ) ) / ( 2i k (1 - e^{2i δ_l}) )

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. Let me think again about the problem statement.

The measured phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and others are ignored. The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0°.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] / sin δ_l ) * (sin((l+1)θ/2) / sin(θ/2) )

At θ=0, the denominator sin(θ/2) tends to zero, but each term's numerator sin((l+1)θ/2) also tends to zero. So perhaps we can take the limit as θ approaches zero. For small θ, sin x ≈ x, so sin((l+1)θ/2) ≈ (l+1)θ/2, and sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2. So the ratio becomes (l+1).

Thus, each term becomes approximately ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ) / ( 2ik sin δ_l ) ) * (l+1) * (θ/2) ) / (θ/2) ), which simplifies to ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) (l+1) ) / (2ik sin δ_l ) )

Wait, but when θ approaches zero, the amplitude should approach f(0), and each term is multiplied by (l+1). But this seems to suggest that each term scales with l+1, which for higher l could be significant. But perhaps the problem expects us to compute each term and sum them up.

Wait, but let's think about the imaginary part of f(0). Since f(θ) is a complex quantity, its imaginary part is the imaginary part of the sum of all the partial waves evaluated at θ=0.

So, for each l, the contribution to Im(f(0)) is Im( f_l ), where f_l is the partial wave amplitude evaluated at θ=0.

Wait, but how to compute f_l at θ=0. Another approach: perhaps in the limit as θ approaches zero, the amplitude f(θ) can be written as f(0) + something proportional to θ^2, so the leading term is f(0). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the imaginary part of f(0) is equal to the sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ) / (2k) ) * (something). Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look up the formula.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / sin δ_l * (sin((l+1)θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) )

So, at θ=0, each term's sin((l+1)θ/2) is zero, but the denominator is also zero. So perhaps we can use L’Hospital's rule or expand in terms of small θ.

Taking the limit as θ approaches zero:

sin((l+1)θ/2) ≈ (l+1)θ/2 - [(l+1)^3 θ^3]/48 + ...
sin(θ/2) ≈ θ/2 - θ^3/(48) + ...

So, the ratio sin((l+1)θ/2)/sin(θ/2) ≈ [ (l+1)θ/2 ] / [θ/2] ] = l+1, when θ is very small.

So, for small θ, the amplitude f(θ) ≈ f(0) + ... where f(0) is given by (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) (l+1) / sin δ_l )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the leading term at θ=0 is just the l=0 term, because higher l terms may vanish faster as θ approaches zero. Let me think: for each l, the term (sin((l+1)θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) becomes (l+1) when θ is very small. So, the amplitude f(0) would be the sum over all l of [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) (l+1) ] / (2ik sin δ_l )

But wait, that's a lot of terms. Let's compute each term for l=0 to 4.

Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. The imaginary part of f(0) can be found using the formula:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l )

Wait, I'm not confident about this formula either. Alternatively, let me look for a formula that directly gives Im(f(0)).

Wait, I think I found a formula in my notes: Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because at θ=0, the amplitude is given by:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / sin δ_l ) * ( ... )

Wait, when θ=0, the angular part becomes (sin( (l+1)*0/2 )) / sin(0/2) ), which is 0/0, so perhaps we can take the limit as θ approaches zero. Using the expansion I did before, each term contributes (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1 )) / (2ik sin δ_l ) ) * (l+1)

But the imaginary part of f(0) would then be the sum over l of Im[ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - 1 )) (l+1) )/(2ik sin δ_l) ) ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to compute each term for l=0 to l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a simpler expression.

Wait, another idea: the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) )/( (1 - e^{2i δ_l}) ) ) * (something)

Wait, I think I'm mixing up different expressions here. Maybe I should think in terms of the partial wave expansion and compute each term.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) sin(2 δ_l )

This formula seems familiar. Let me check: for each l, the term would be (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) summed over all l, multiplied by 1/(2k).

If this is correct, then I can compute each term for l=0 to l=4, sum them, and multiply by 1/(2k).

Wait, but what is k? k is the wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to compute k in appropriate units. Let me think about units: 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

The electron mass is m_e = about 0.511 MeV/c². But since the energy is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, maybe we can use the relativistic approximation for k.

In high-energy (ultrarelativistic) limit, the relation between energy E and momentum p is E ≈ pc. So, p = E/c ≈ 50 MeV / c.

But wait, the wave number k is given by k = p / ħ. Let me compute k.

First, let me compute ħ in MeV·fm.

We know that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, but perhaps I can compute k as follows.

E = 50 MeV. Since E ≈ pc, p = E / c. Wait, but for units, using E in MeV, p would be in MeV/c.

But when calculating k = p / ħ, we can write:

k = ( p ) / ħ = (E/(c)) / ( ħ / c ) ) ) = E/( ħ c )

Wait, because p = E/(c) when E is much larger than m c². So, k = (E/(c)) / ( ħ / (c) ) ) = E / ( ħ c )

So, since ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = E / ( ħ c ) = 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV·fm ≈ 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, so k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/(2k) is 1/(2 * 0.253) ≈ 1/(0.506) ≈ 1.976 fm.

Wait, that's interesting. So each term in the sum is (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), and then multiplied by 1.976 fm.

So, let's compute each term for l=0 to l=4:

l=0: (2*0 +1) =1. δ₀=90°, sin(2*90°)=sin(180°)=0. So term is 1 * 0 = 0.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ₁=67°, sin(134°)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193. So term=3*0.7193≈2.158.

l=2: (2*2+1)=5. δ₂=55°, sin(110°)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397. So term=5 * 0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: (2*3+1)=7. δ₃=30°, sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660. So term=7 * 0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9. δ₄=13°, sin(26°)=approx 0.4384. So term=9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum these terms:

l=0: 0

l=1: 2.158

l=2: 4.6985 → total so far: 6.8565

l=3: 6.062 → total: 12.9185

l=4: 3.9456 → total: 16.8641

Now multiply by 1/(2k) which we found to be approximately 1.976 fm.

So 16.8641 * 1.976 ≈ let's compute that.

16.8641 * 2 = 33.7282, but since it's 1.976, which is 2 - 0.024, so 16.8641*(2-0.024) = 33.7282 - (16.8641 * 0.024).

16.8641 * 0.024 = 0.4047384.

So 33.7282 - 0.4047384 ≈ 33.3235.

Wait, but wait, 16.8641 * 1.976 = ?

Alternatively, compute 16.8641 * 1.976.

Let me compute 16.8641 * 1.976:

1.976 is approximately 2 - 0.024.

But to compute more accurately:

16.8641 * 1.976 = 16.8641 * (2 - 0.024) = (16.8641 * 2) - (16.8641 * 0.024).

=33.7282 - (0.4047384) = 33.3234616 ≈33.3235.

Wait, but let me double-check with exact multiplication.

16.8641 × 1.976:

Compute 16 × 1.976 = 31.616

0.8641 × 1.976: Let's compute 0.8 * 1.976 = 1.5808, 0.06 *1.976=0.11856, 0.0041 *1.976≈0.0081016.

Adding up: 1.5808 + 0.11856 = 1.69936 + 0.0081016 ≈1.70746.

So total is 31.616 +1.70746 = 33.32346.

So Im(f(0)) ≈33.3235 fm.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the closest is option A) 87163.4 fm, which is way higher. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a minute, perhaps my assumption about the formula is incorrect. Maybe I should think again.

Wait, when I used the formula Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), and calculated it, I got approximately 33.3235 fm. But that's nowhere near any of the options given.

The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine.

Alternative approach: perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but let's test this. For l=0, sin(90)=1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: 3 sin67≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 sin55≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 sin30≈7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin13≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum: 1 + 2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

Multiply by 1/k = 1/(0.253 fm⁻¹) ≈ 3.9526 fm.

So 13.382 *3.9526 ≈ 52.8.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ) / (2ik) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each term's imaginary part.

Wait, for a general term in the sum, each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / (2ik sin δ_l )

So the imaginary part of each term is Im[ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / (2ik sin δ_l ) ]

Let me compute this for each l.

Let me compute the numerator as (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) = (2l+1) [ e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ]

So the term becomes (2l+1) (e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ) / (2ik sin δ_l )

We can write this as (2l+1)/(2ik sin δ_l) ) * ( e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} )

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1)/(2k sin δ_l) ) * Im( e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} )

Im(e^{i θ}) = sinθ, so:

Im( e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ) = sin(2δ_l) - sin(δ_l )

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) ( sin(2 δ_l) - sin δ_l ) / ( 2k sin δ_l )

So, Im(f_l) = (2l+1) ( sin(2 δ_l) - sin δ_l ) / ( 2k sin δ_l )

Let me compute this for each l.

First, compute each term:

l=0: δ=90°, sin(90)=1, sin(180)=0.

Im(f_0) = (1) (0 -1 ) / (2k *1 ) ) = (-1)/(2k )

But wait, that would be negative. But perhaps I'm not considering the correct signs.

Wait, but let me compute:

sin(2δ) = sin(180°) =0.

So, (0 -1) = -1.

So, Im(f_0)= (1) * (-1) / (2k *1 ) = -1/(2k)

But this is just one term; let's compute the others.

l=1: δ=67°, sin(67)≈0.9205.

sin(2δ)= sin(134)= sin(46)=0.7193.

So, (0.7193 -0.9205)= -0.2012.

Im(f_1)= 3*(-0.2012)/(2k *0.9205 )

= (3*(-0.2012)) / (2k *0.9205 )

= (-0.6036) / (1.841 k )

= approximately -0.328 /k.

l=2: δ=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192.

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

So, 0.9397 -0.8192=0.1205.

Im(f_2)=5*(0.1205)/(2k *0.8192 )

= (0.6025)/(1.6384 k )

≈ 0.6025/(1.6384 *k ) ≈ 0.3677/(k)

l=3: δ=30°, sin(30)=0.5.

sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

0.8660 -0.5=0.3660.

Im(f_3)=7*(0.3660)/(2k *0.5 )

= 7 * 0.3660 / (k )

= 2.562 /k.

l=4: δ=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495.

sin(26)≈0.4384.

0.4384 -0.22495≈0.21345.

Im(f_4)=9*(0.21345)/(2k *0.22495 )

= (1.92105) / (0.4499 k )

≈4.268/(k )

Now, sum all the Im(f_l) for l=0 to l=4:

Im(f_0)= -1/(2k )

Im(f_1)= -0.328 /k

Im(f_2)= 0.3677/k

Im(f_3)= 2.562/k

Im(f_4)=4.268/k

Total Im(f) = [ (-0.5) -0.328 +0.3677 +2.562 +4.268 ] /k

Wait, because Im(f_0)= -1/(2k) = -0.5/k.

So,

-0.5 -0.328 = -0.828

+0.3677 → -0.4603

+2.562 → 2.1017

+4.268 →6.3697.

So total sum is 6.3697/k.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when l=0, the term is negative, but the others are positive. So let me re-calculate:

Wait, no, I think I did this correctly. Let me add them:

-0.5 (from l=0)

-0.328 (l=1) → total -0.828

+0.3677 (l=2) → -0.828 +0.3677 = -0.4603

+2.562 (l=3) → 2.1017

+4.268 (l=4) → 6.3697.

So total is 6.3697/k.

Now, using k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹, so 6.3697 / 0.253 ≈ approximately 25.16 fm.

Wait, that's close to option D) 251.271 fm, but off by a factor of about 10. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recompute k.

The energy is 50 MeV, and since E ≈ pc, p = E/c = 50 MeV/c.

The wave number k = p / ħ.

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm ) / c.

But when calculating p = E/c, and k = p/ħ, substituting ħ:

k = (E/(c)) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm )/(c) ) ) = E / (197.33 MeV·fm )

So, k = (50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) = 50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that part is correct.

So, Im(f) =6.3697 / 0.253 ≈25.16 fm.

But none of the options are around 25 fm. The closest is option D, which is 251.271 fm. So that's a factor of 10 difference. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for Im(f_l). Let me re-examine.

Wait, the term I computed for each l is the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude. So the total Im(f) is the sum of all Im(f_l). But wait, the formula I derived earlier may not be correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the correct expression for the imaginary part of f(0) is sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k) )

Wait, but when I tried that earlier, the sum was around 13.38, multiplied by 1/k (approx 3.9526 fm) gives about 52.8 fm, which also doesn't match any options.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different formula for the scattering amplitude, perhaps in terms of the Born approximation or something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the cross-section via the optical theorem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, which is related to the sum of the phase shifts.

Wait, the forward scattering amplitude f(0) can be written as:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / sin δ_l

But when evaluating this, perhaps we can take the imaginary part.

The imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ Im( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / sin δ_l )

The term inside is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) / sin δ_l.

Let me rewrite this as (2l+1) [e^{i 2 δ_l} - e^{i δ_l} ] / ( sin δ_l )

The imaginary part of this is (2l+1) [ sin(2 δ_l) - sin(δ_l) ] / sin δ_l.

So, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin(2 δ_l) - sin δ_l ] / sin δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1.

δ=90°, sin(90)=1.

sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0.

[0 -1 ] /1 = -1.

So term: 1*(-1) = -1.

l=1: δ=67°, sin=0.9205.

sin(2δ)=sin(134)=0.7193.

[0.7193 -0.9205 ] /0.9205 ≈ (-0.2012)/0.9205 ≈-0.2186.

Multiply by (3): 3*(-0.2186)= -0.6558.

l=2: δ=55°, sin=0.8192.

sin(110)=0.9397.

[0.9397 -0.8192]/0.8192 ≈ 0.1205 /0.8192 ≈0.147.

Multiply by 5: 5*0.147≈0.735.

l=3: δ=30°, sin=0.5.

sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

[0.8660-0.5]/0.5 = (0.366)/0.5=0.732.

Multiply by 7: 7*0.732≈5.124.

l=4: δ=13°, sin≈0.22495.

sin(26)=0.4384.

[0.4384 -0.22495]/0.22495 ≈0.2135/0.22495≈0.949.

Multiply by 9: 9*0.949≈8.541.

Now sum all terms:

l=0: -1.

l=1: -0.6558 → sum: -1.6558

l=2: +0.735 → sum: -0.9208

l=3: +5.124 → sum:4.2032

l=4: +8.541 → sum:12.7442.

Now, multiply by 1/(2k) =1/(2*0.253)≈1.976 fm.

So 12.7442 *1.976 ≈ let's compute:

12 *1.976 = 23.712.

0.7442 *1.976 ≈ approx 1.475.

Total ≈23.712 +1.475≈25.187 fm.

Hmm, that's about 25.19 fm. But none of the options are close to that. The closest option is D)251.271 fm, which is about ten times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula for Im(f(0)).

Wait, I'm getting Im(f(0))=25.19 fm, but the options are higher. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 somewhere in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me re-express k again.

k = E / (ħ c) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹. That seems correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should use the non-relativistic expression for k.

Wait, but 50 MeV is much larger than the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV), so using E≈pc is correct. So k is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires the answer to be in different units. For example, maybe the cross-section is in barns, but the problem states the answer is in fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.

I'm now really stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at zero angle is given by:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] / sin δ_l )

But I need to compute this sum.

Another approach: for each l, compute (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] / sin δ_l, then take the imaginary part and sum.

Let me compute this for each l.

l=0: δ=90°, e^{i90}=i. So e^{iδ}(e^{iδ} -1) =i*(i-1)=i^2 -i = -1 -i.

Divide by sin(90)=1 → -1 -i. The imaginary part is -1.

Multiply by (2l+1)=1 → -1.

l=1: δ=67°, e^{i67} is cos67 +i sin67 ≈0.3907 +i 0.9205.

e^{i67} -1 ≈ (0.3907-1) +i 0.9205 → -0.6093 +i 0.9205.

Multiply by e^{i67}:

(0.3907 +i 0.9205) * (-0.6093 +i 0.9205).

Let me compute this:

Real part: (0.3907)(-0.6093) + (0.9205)(0.9205) = (-0.2379) + 0.8473 → 0.6094.

Imaginary part: (0.3907)(0.9205) + (-0.6093)(0.9205) → (0.360) + (-0.560) → -0.200.

So the product is 0.6094 -0.200 i.

Divide by sin(67)=0.9205:

(0.6094 -0.200 i)/0.9205 → approximately 0.6617 -0.2173 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3 → 1.985 - 0.6519 i.

Imaginary part: -0.6519.

l=2: δ=55°.

e^{i55}=0.5736 +i 0.8192.

e^{i55}-1 ≈-0.4264 +i 0.8192.

Multiply:

(0.5736 +i 0.8192) * (-0.4264 +i 0.8192).

Real part: 0.5736*(-0.4264) + 0.8192*0.8192 ≈ (-0.2445) + 0.6711 → 0.4266.

Imaginary part: 0.5736 *0.8192 + (-0.4264)*0.8192 → 0.4707 - 0.3494 →0.1213.

So product is 0.4266 +0.1213i.

Divide by sin(55)=0.8192 → 0.5207 +0.148 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=5 →2.6035 +0.740 i.

Imaginary part:0.740.

l=3: δ=30°.

e^{i30} =√3/2 + i 0.5 →≈0.8660 +i 0.5.

e^{i30} -1 ≈-0.1340 +i0.5.

Multiply:

(0.8660 +i0.5) * (-0.1340 +i0.5).

Real: 0.8660*(-0.134) + 0.5*0.5 → (-0.1162) +0.25 →0.1338.

Imaginary: 0.8660*0.5 + (-0.134)*0.5 →0.433 -0.067 →0.366.

So product is 0.1338 +i0.366.

Divide by sin(30)=0.5 → 0.2676 +0.732 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=7 →1.873 +5.124 i.

Imaginary part:5.124.

l=4: δ=13°.

e^{i13} ≈0.9744 +i0.22495.

e^{i13} -1 ≈-0.0256 +i0.22495.

Multiply:

(0.9744 +i0.22495) * (-0.0256 +i0.22495).

Real part: 0.9744*(-0.0256) + 0.22495*0.22495 → (-0.02499) +0.0506 →0.0256.

Imaginary part: 0.9744 *0.22495 + (-0.0256)*0.22495 → (0.2192) -0.00576 →0.2134.

So product is 0.0256 +i0.2134.

Divide by sin(13)=0.22495 → 0.1137 +0.948 i.

Multiply by (2l+1)=9 →1.0233 +8.532 i.

Imaginary part:8.532.

Now, sum all the imaginary parts:

l=0: -1.

l=1: -0.6519 → total: -1.6519.

l=2: +0.740 → total: -0.9119.

l=3: +5.124 → total:4.2121.

l=4: +8.532 → total:12.7441.

Multiply by 1/(2k) =1/(2*0.253) ≈1.976 fm.

So 12.7441 *1.976 ≈25.18 fm.

Again, same result as before. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should have used k = E/(ħ c) in the correct units. Let me compute ħ c in fm·MeV.

ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = E / (ħ c) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) =50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But perhaps I should calculate k in units of inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers. Let me see.

Wait, no, because the options are in fm, so the calculation should be in consistent units.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the wave number k has units of inverse meters, but in the formula, I'm using it in inverse femtometers. Let me check.

Wait, 1 fm = 1e-15 meters.

So, 1 fm⁻¹ =1e15 m⁻¹.

So, k=0.253 fm⁻¹ = 0.253e15 m⁻¹.

But the calculation of Im(f(0)) is in fm, so when I multiply by 1/k (which is in fm), I need to make sure units are correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the formula for Im(f(0)) is in units of fm, and the calculation is correct, but none of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the Born approximation, which is f = (k/(4π)) (e^{2iδ_0} -1 ) e^{iδ_0}.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} -1) ) / ( sin δ_l )

But perhaps for l>0, these terms are negligible, and only l=0 contributes.

Wait, but for l=0, delta is 90 degrees, so e^{i90}=i, and e^{i delta}=i.

So, (e^{i delta}-1)=i-1.

So, (e^{i delta} (e^{i delta}-1 ))=i*(i-1)=i^2 -i= -1 -i.

Divide by sin delta=1, so ( -1 -i ).

Multiply by (2l+1)=1.

So, term is (-1 -i).

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * ( (-1 -i) )

Im(f(0)) is the imaginary part of ( (-1 -i) )/(2ik )

= [ (-i) ]/(2ik )

= [ -1/(2k) ) ].

Which is -1/(2k).

But k=0.253 fm⁻¹, so 1/(2k)=1/(0.506)=1.976 fm.

So, Im(f(0))= -1.976 fm.

But the options are positive, so perhaps I made a sign mistake. Or perhaps only the positive part is considered.

Wait, but this is just the contribution from l=0, and earlier calculations showed that higher l terms add to a larger positive value.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the contribution from l=0.

But in that case, Im(f(0))= -1.976 fm, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I'm not able to reach any of the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. But given the time I've spent, I'll go with the closest option, which is D) 251.271 fm, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum, and the correct answer is option D, which is approximately 251 fm, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived from the partial wave expansion:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \frac{\sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l)}{\sin(\delta_l)}.
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number Calculation**:  
   The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation \( E \approx pc \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \). The value of \( k \) is determined as:
   \[
   k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Imaginary Part Contribution from Each \( l \)**:  
   For each \( l \), the contribution to \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is computed using:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f_l) = \frac{(2l+1)}{2k \sin(\delta_l)} \left[ \sin(2\delta_l) - \sin(\delta_l) \right].
   \]
   The contributions for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \) are:
   - \( l = 0 \): \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_0) = 0 \), \( \sin(\delta_0) = 1 \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_0) = \frac{1}{2k} \left[ 0 - 1 \right] = -\frac{1}{2k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 1 \): \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_1) = \frac{3}{2k \cdot 0.9205} \left[ 0.7193 - 0.9205 \right] \approx -\frac{0.6558}{k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 2 \): \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_2) = \frac{5}{2k \cdot 0.8192} \left[ 0.9397 - 0.8192 \right] \approx \frac{0.3677}{k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 3 \): \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_3) = \frac{7}{2k \cdot 0.5} \left[ 0.8660 - 0.5 \right] \approx \frac{2.562}{k}.
     \]
   - \( l = 4 \): \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \),  
     \[
     \text{Im}(f_4) = \frac{9}{2k \cdot 0.22495} \left[ 0.4384 - 0.22495 \right] \approx \frac{4.268}{k}.
     \]

3. **Summing Contributions**:  
   Summing the contributions for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \left[ -1 - 0.6558 + 0.3677 + 2.562 + 4.268 \right].
   \]
   The total inside the brackets is approximately \( 12.744 \). Multiplying by \( \frac{1}{2k} \approx 1.976 \, \text{fm} \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 12.744 \cdot 1.976 \approx 25.19 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( 25.19 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is \( \mathbf{D) \, 251.271 \, \text{fm}} \), which is approximately a factor of 10 higher. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the interpretation of the formula or units.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable choice is:
