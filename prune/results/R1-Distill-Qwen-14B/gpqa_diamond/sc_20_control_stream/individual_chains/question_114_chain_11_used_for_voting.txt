Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's usually an example of nucleophilic addition. But wait, how does that work exactly? Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can undergo a reaction where the cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl carbon.

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is present, I think the reaction is called the Henry reaction or maybe it's just a ketone cyanohydrin formation. The product would have both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

I recall that the formation of a cyanohydrin typically requires an acid catalyst. So reagent A should be an acidic one. Looking at the options, H3O+ is a possible choice. Or maybe something else like sulfuric acid?

Wait, the options give A as either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What's that used for? Oh, sometimes for reactions like the addition of bisulfite to carbonyl groups, but maybe in this case, it's not the right reagent. Because for the cyanohydrin, acid is needed, not a bisulfite.

So for reaction A, the reagent is likely H3O+. So looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So if I'm right, the first reagent is H3O+, which would be options A or B.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And it's reacting with reagent B in H2O to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So what's happening here?

Wait, so the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Looking at the structure, the nitrile group (CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). So the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, strong acidic conditions are usually used. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with a strong base followed by acid workup.

But in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group (2-hydroxy). So how does the nitrile group convert? Let me think. Nitrile hydrolysis steps: generally, under strong acidic conditions, the nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if using a base, you might get a carboxylate which can then be acidified.

Wait, the reaction is written as reagent B (H2O). So perhaps it's an acidic hydrolysis. Or maybe the conditions involve heating with an acid.

Wait, but reagent B is given as the option. Looking at the options for B: it's either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

So the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for that are usually H2O with HCl (like concentrated HCl) under reflux, or sometimes using a strong acid like H2SO4.

Wait, but another possibility is using a weak acid. For instance, sometimes nitrile hydrolysis can be done in the presence of a weak acid, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Alternatively, it could be a two-step process: first, the nitrile is converted to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation with an acid catalyst (like H3O+), and the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group. So for the hydrolysis, I think strong acid is used. So HCl would be a possible reagent.

Looking at the options for reagent B: options A and C have B as HCl. So if I think that B is HCl, then the correct option would be either A or C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first reaction's reagent A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. For the cyanohydrin, H3O+ is needed, so that suggests option A or B (since A is H3O+ in options A and B).

But then for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl or others. So if B is HCl, then reagent in option A (reagent B is HCl) would be correct. But I'm a bit confused because the options for B are different.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (which I think it should be), then the options are A or B. Now, for the second reaction, whether B is HCl or something else.

So for the second reaction, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed. Let's think about the conditions. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must have gone all the way. If the reaction is done in aqueous HCl, that's a strong acid condition. Alternatively, if it's done in aqueous CH3COOH (a weak acid), perhaps with heat or a catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is typically done under strong acidic conditions. So I think HCl would be the reagent B here.

So if A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that would be option A. But let me make sure. Another possibility is that in the second reaction, the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, then further to a carboxylic acid. But that usually requires different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis under basic conditions followed by acid workup, but the reagents given for B are H2O and B.

Wait, the reaction is written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the reagent B is in H2O. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in water, with HCl as the acid.

So in that case, reagent B would be HCl. So then, the correct option is where A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That's option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The first reaction's reagent is H3O+ (acid), which makes sense. Second reaction, in H2O and with HCl, which would provide the acidic conditions for the nitrile hydrolysis. So yes, option A would be correct.

Wait, but another point: the first reaction has NaCN and H3O+ as reagents. So butan-2-one + NaCN and H3O+ would produce the cyanohydrin. That makes sense.

But what about alternative conditions? Could NaHSO3 be used there? No, I don't think so. NaHSO3 is used for other types of additions, maybe like the formation of bisulfite adducts, but not for cyanohydrins. So I think A should be H3O+.

So putting it all together, the correct option is A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to facilitate the nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the suitable acid catalyst for this reaction, making A = H₃O⁺ the correct choice.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl provides the necessary acidic environment for this reaction, making B = HCl the correct choice.

Combining these, the correct option is A: A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
