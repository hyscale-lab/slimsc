Okay, so I've come across this astronomy problem, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the orbital period for system_1 is longer than that of system_2.

The next part says that spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the velocities have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. They want the ratio of the total masses, considering each system's mass is the sum of its two stars.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The amplitude of the velocity variations relates to the mass of the companion star.

Wait, the radial velocity method relies on the Doppler shift. Each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit (and thus smaller velocity) if I'm not mistaken. Because mass is inversely proportional to velocity in a two-body system. So if one star has a higher velocity amplitude, it's less massive.

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) )

But maybe I don't need to get that deep. Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit, the ratio of the velocities of the two stars is inversely proportional to their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1, where K is the velocity amplitude.

Wait, let me think. If the system is a binary with two stars orbiting a common center of mass, then each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. So if star A has mass M_A and velocity v_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity v_B, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A.

Wait, that makes sense because F = ma, so the accelerations (which are proportional to velocity changes) are the same for both, so mass times velocity change (since a = v/t, and both have same a) would be same. So M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B. So M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A.

Right, so for each system, I can find the mass ratio.

Let me tackle system_1 first. The RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Let me call these K1 and K2.

So for system_1, K1 = 10, K2 =5.

Using the ratio, M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Because K is the velocity amplitude, which is proportional to (M_secondary / (M_total)) )^(1/3) * ( (2πG/P) )^(1/3) ). Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, since the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses, the mass of each star is inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes.

So M1 + M2 = M_total.

But for each star, M1 = (K2 / K1) * M2.

Wait maybe that's the way. Let me see. So M1 / M2 = K2 / K1.

So for system_1:

M1 / M2 = 5 / 10 = 1/2.

So M1 is half of M2 in system_1. So the total mass for system_1 is M1 + M2 = (1/2 M2) + M2 = (3/2) M2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If M1 is half of M2, then M2 is twice M1. So M1 = (1/2) M2. So M_total for system_1 is M1 + M2 = (1/2 M2) + M2 = (3/2) M2.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let's make it clear.

Let me denote for system_1:

Star A has velocity K1 =10 km/s.

Star B has velocity K2=5 km/s.

So M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A = 5/10= 0.5.

So M_A = 0.5 M_B.

So M_A = (1/2) M_B.

So the total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = (1/2 M_B) + M_B = (3/2) M_B.

Wait, so the total mass of system_1 is 1.5 times M_B. But wait, M_B is the mass of star B in system_1.

Wait, but how does this relate to the masses of the entire system_1 and system_2?

Wait, maybe I should calculate the mass function, but perhaps a simpler approach is to find the mass ratio for each system and then compare the total masses.

Alternatively, since the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses, the mass of each star can be expressed in terms of the velocities.

So for system_1, let me write:

M1 = (v2 / v1) * M2,

where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars.

Wait, no. Wait, let's correct that.

The masses are inversely proportional to the velocities: M1 / M2 = v2 / v1.

So for system_1:

v1 = 10 km/s (star A)

v2 = 5 km/s (star B)

So M1 / M2 = 5 / 10 = 0.5.

So M1 = 0.5 M2.

So M_total_system_1 = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but wait, M2 here is the mass of star B in system_1. But I'm not sure if this is the right approach because I'm mixing up the M2 from different systems. Maybe I should define each system's stars separately.

Let me denote for system_1:

Star A1 has velocity K1 =10 km/s.

Star A2 has velocity K2 =5 km/s.

So M_A1 / M_A2 = K_A2 / K_A1 = 5/10=0.5.

So M_A1 = 0.5 M_A2.

So the total mass of system_1, M1_total = M_A1 + M_A2 = 0.5 M_A2 + M_A2 = 1.5 M_A2.

Similarly, for system_2:

The velocities are K1=15 km/s and K2=10 km/s.

So M_B1 / M_B2 = K_B2 / K_B1 = 10/15 = 2/3.

So M_B1 = (2/3) M_B2.

So the total mass of system_2, M2_total = M_B1 + M_B2 = (2/3) M_B2 + M_B2 = (5/3) M_B2.

Now, the question is, what is the ratio of the masses of the systems.

So it's M1_total / M2_total = (1.5 M_A2) / ( (5/3) M_B2 )

Wait, but this seems complicated because I don't know the relationship between M_A2 and M_B2.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the system mass as a function of the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Because the mass function involves the period as well.

Wait, the mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G )

But wait, actually, the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but this is when you can only see the spectrum of one star. But in the case where both stars' velocities are known, perhaps a better approach is possible.

Alternatively, the total mass of the system can be found from the velocities and the period, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period can be used to find the masses.

Each star's velocity is given by:

v = 2π a sin i / P

Where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and i is the inclination angle (if i is 90 degrees, sin i is 1, which is the case for eclipsing binaries, so sin i =1).

So for each star:

v1 = (2π a1) / P

v2 = (2π a2) / P

And since the two stars orbit the center of mass, a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the stars), and M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So M1/M2 = a2/a1.

But I also know that a1 + a2 = a (the total separation), but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, let's think about the velocity ratio.

From the velocity amplitudes, since M1 a1 = M2 a2,

And a1 = (v1 P) / (2π )

Similarly, a2 = (v2 P) / (2π )

So M1 * (v1 P)/(2π) = M2 * (v2 P)/(2π )

The P and 2π cancel out.

So M1 v1 = M2 v2.

So M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

Which brings us back to the earlier point.

So in system_1, M1 = (v2 / v1) M2.

v1 is 10, v2 is 5.

So M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2.

Total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

In system_2, M1 = (v2/v1) M2.

v1 is 15, v2 is 10.

So M1 = (10/15) M2 = (2/3) M2.

Total mass is (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

But wait, here the M2 refers to the masses in each system. So in system_1, M2 is the mass of star 2, and in system_2, M2 is the mass of star 2. So I think I might be mixing variables here.

Wait, perhaps I should treat each system separately and express the mass ratio between the two systems.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to find the ratio of the system's total masses.

Let me think: the total mass of each system can be found using Kepler's third law.

But Kepler's third law for a binary system is:

P^2 = (4π² G) (M1 + M2) a^3

Wait, but a is the semi-major axis. Hmm, but I don't have the semi-major axis here.

Alternatively, using the radial velocities, the total mass can be calculated.

Wait, I've heard that when you have both stars' velocities, the total mass can be determined directly.

The formula I recall is:

M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, no, I think that's only when you have the velocity of one star and the mass function. Let me think again.

Wait, when both stars' velocities are known, the mass function can be calculated more accurately.

Alternatively, since each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass, perhaps the mass ratio can be used to find the individual masses, and then sum them for each system.

But I think I'm complicating things. Maybe a better approach is to find the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2.

Wait, let's consider each system's individual mass.

For system_1:

M1 + M2 = M_total_1.

We have M1 / M2 = v2 / v1 = 5/10 = 1/2.

So M1 = (1/2) M2.

So M_total_1 = (1/2) M2 + M2 = (3/2) M2.

Similarly, for system_2:

M1 / M2 = v2 / v1 = 10/15 = 2/3.

So M1 = (2/3) M2.

So M_total_2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but wait, in system_1 and system_2, the M2 refers to different stars. So perhaps I should use different variables.

Let me denote for system_1, the two masses as M1a and M1b.

For system_1: M1a / M1b = 5/10 = 1/2.

So M1a = (1/2) M1b.

Total mass of system_1: M1a + M1b = (1/2 M1b) + M1b = (3/2) M1b.

Similarly, for system_2, the two masses are M2a and M2b.

M2a / M2b = 10/15 = 2/3.

So M2a = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass of system_2: M2a + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio (M1_total) / (M2_total) = [ (3/2) M1b ] / [ (5/3) M2b ].

But without knowing the relationship between M1b and M2b, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the systems have different orbital periods. Maybe the periods can help in finding the ratio of the masses.

Hmm, I remember that for a binary system, the total mass is related to the period and the velocity amplitudes via the formula:

M_total = (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2π G )

Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.

The formula for the mass function when both velocities are known is:

f(M) = ( (v1^3 + v2^3) * P ) / (2 π G )

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to use the relation that the mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the mass of each system can be determined using the formula involving the sum of the velocities, the period, and gravitational constant.

Wait, let me recall that:

The total mass (M1 + M2) can be found using:

M1 + M2 = (4π² a^3 ) / ( G P² )

But a is the orbital separation, which is also equal to a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star's orbit.

But a1 = (v1 P)/(2 π ), since a1 = v1 * (P/(2 π )) * 2, wait no, velocity is 2π a1 / P.

So a1 = (v1 * P) / (2 π )

Similarly, a2 = (v2 * P) / (2 π )

So a = a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P/(2 π )

Then, substituting into Kepler's third law:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a^3) / ( G P² )

= [4 π² ( (v1 + v2) P/(2 π ) )^3 ] / (G P² )

= [4 π² ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )/( 8 π^3 ) ) ] / (G P^2 )

Simplify numerator:

4 π² * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 ) ) 

= (4 π^2) / (8 π^3 ) ) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 

= (1/(2 π )) (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 

So M1 + M2 = [ (1/(2 π )) (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) ] / ( G P^2 )

= (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

So M_total = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

Ah, so the total mass is given by that formula.

So for each system, we can compute M_total.

Let me apply this to both systems.

First, system_1:

v1 =10 km/s, v2=5 km/s.

P=2 years.

So sum_v1 = 10 +5 =15 km/s.

So M1_total = (15^3 * 2 ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but wait, I should make sure the units are consistent. Because G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, and velocities are in km/s, and period in years. So perhaps it's better to convert everything to SI units.

But maybe I can just take the ratio, as the constants will cancel out.

So the mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P.

Wait, but in the formula, it's (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2 π G )

So if I calculate M1 and M2 using this formula, their ratio would be:

(M1_total) / (M2_total) = [ (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 P2 ]

Because the other factors (2 π G) are the same for both systems, so they cancel out when taking the ratio.

So:

Ratio = [ (10 +5)^3 * 2 ] / [ (15 +10)^3 * 1 ]

Because system_1 has P=2 years, system_2 has P=1 year.

Compute numerator: (15)^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2=6750.

Denominator: (25)^3 * 1 = 15625 *1=15625.

So ratio = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

So M1_total is approximately 0.432 times M2_total.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if ratio is 0.432, that would mean system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive.

But the options are about system_1 being more massive. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, system_1: v1=10, v2=5. So sum_v1=15.

P1=2 years.

system_2: v1=15, v2=10. sum_v2=25.

P2=1 year.

So ratio = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ]

Compute 15^3 = 3375.

25^3=15625.

So 3375 *2=6750.

6750 /15625 = 0.432.

So M1_total is 0.432 times M2_total.

Which means system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. That would be M1 / M2 = 0.432, which is approximately 0.43. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is about twice as massive.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, which is close to 0.43. So the factor would be approximately 0.4, meaning system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

Wait, but the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if it's 0.43, that's about 0.4 times, so system_1 is less massive than system_2.

Wait, but the options are about how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. So if system_1 is 0.43 times as massive, then it's less massive. So the factor is 0.43, which is option A.

But wait, the question is phrased as 'by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2.' So the factor is (M1 / M2). If that's 0.43, then system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is about 2.3 times as massive as system_1.

But the question is about system_1 being more massive than system_2. So if the ratio is 0.43, that's less than 1, meaning system_1 is less massive.

But the options don't have an option that says 'less than 1' in a positive way, but the options are about system_1's mass compared to system_2. So the correct answer would be approximately 0.4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4.

Wait, but wait earlier I thought that when the velocities are higher, the mass is lower. So when system_2 has higher velocity sum (25 vs 15), perhaps that leads to a higher mass? Because in the formula, the mass is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P.

Wait, let me think again. The formula says M_total is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 times P.

So for system_1: (15)^3 *2 = 3375 *2=6750.

System_2: (25)^3 *1=15625.

So system_2's mass is higher. So the ratio of M1 to M2 is 6750 /15625 =0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the answer is 0.43, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and total mass in binary systems. The total mass of a binary system is proportional to \((v_1 + v_2)^3 \cdot P\), where \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and \(P\) is the orbital period.

### Step 1: Key Data
- **System 1**:
  - Orbital period: \(P_1 = 2\) years.
  - Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s}\).
  - Total velocity: \(v_{\text{sum,1}} = v_{1,1} + v_{2,1} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\).

- **System 2**:
  - Orbital period: \(P_2 = 1\) year.
  - Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\).
  - Total velocity: \(v_{\text{sum,2}} = v_{1,2} + v_{2,2} = 25 \, \text{km/s}\).

### Step 2: Mass Ratio Formula
The total mass of each system is proportional to \((v_{\text{sum}})^3 \cdot P\). Thus, the ratio of the total masses of the two systems is given by:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(v_{\text{sum,1}})^3 \cdot P_1}{(v_{\text{sum,2}})^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

### Step 3: Substituting Values
- For system_1:
  \[
  (v_{\text{sum,1}})^3 \cdot P_1 = (15)^3 \cdot 2 = 3375 \cdot 2 = 6750
  \]

- For system_2:
  \[
  (v_{\text{sum,2}})^3 \cdot P_2 = (25)^3 \cdot 1 = 15625 \cdot 1 = 15625
  \]

- Ratio:
  \[
  \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
  \]

### Step 4: Interpretation
The ratio \(M_{\text{total,1}} / M_{\text{total,2}} = 0.432\) indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. This means system_1 is less massive than system_2, and the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.

### Final Answer
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.
