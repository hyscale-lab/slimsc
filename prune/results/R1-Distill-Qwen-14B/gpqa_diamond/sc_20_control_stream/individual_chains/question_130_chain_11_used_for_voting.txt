Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember a bit about this from my astronomy class. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, redshift... right, when a source is moving away, the wavelength stretches. The Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. But if the cloud is at a high redshift, that absorption line will shift into longer wavelengths—like into the optical range.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths much beyond the visible spectrum. Wait, what's the cutoff? Oh right, the atmosphere is opaque to certain wavelengths. Like, the atmosphere absorbs a lot of infrared, so ground-based telescopes are limited to certain ranges where the atmosphere is transparent. Oh, right! The atmospheric window. I think the optical range is roughly from about 300 nm to around 2500 nm or so, but wait, no. Wait, visible light is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But ground-based telescopes can also observe some near-infrared, right? But I'm not sure about the exact cutoff. Let me think: the atmosphere's transmission windows. I remember that for optical, ground-based telescopes can observe up to about 1 micrometer (1000 nm) or so, but maybe a bit more. Wait, but my notes said that the optical range is about 300 nm to 2500 nm, but considering what's observable from the ground, it's more like up to around 1.6 micrometers because beyond that, the atmosphere absorbs a lot. But maybe for this problem, they're considering the Lyman-alpha line as observed in the optical, which is up to about 1 micrometer.

So, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm, way in the UV. But when the cloud is at some redshift z, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z). So for the cloud to be detected, the observed wavelength must be within the range that optical telescopes can see.

Wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, which is in front of it. So the quasar is farther away than the cloud. The absorption line from the cloud is at 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z). For this to be in the optical, what's the maximum wavelength the telescope can see? Let's say the limit is about 1000 nm, which is 10000 Angstroms. So, 1216 * (1 + z) < 10000? Let me calculate that.

1216*(1 + z) = 10000 → 1+z = 10000/1216 ≈ 8.224 → z≈7.224. But wait, that would be when the wavelength is at the upper limit. But wait, no, because ground-based telescopes can't observe beyond certain wavelengths. So maybe the Lyman alpha line needs to be in the optical range, which is up to about 1000 nm.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait a second, the quasar's own light is in the optical, but when the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, it absorbs the quasar's light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. So when the cloud is at a high redshift, the absorption line is shifted into longer wavelengths. So if the cloud's redshift is such that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical, then the quasar's light can be observed through that line.

But wait, the quasar's light is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the quasar is behind the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So the cloud's absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud), and the quasar's emission lines are at higher wavelengths.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud (z_cloud) such that the absorption line can be detected in optical.

So for the absorption line (1216*(1+z)) to be in the optical range, which is up to about 1 micrometer (1000 nm), which is 10000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1+z) <= 10000 → 1 + z <= 10000/1216 ≈ 8.224 → z <= 7.224. Wait, but that would give z_cloud up to about 7.2. But the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, no, maybe I got it the other way around. Oh, wait, no. The redshift increases as the object moves away. So for the Lyman alpha to be in the optical, the cloud must have a certain minimum redshift.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Lyman alpha line is in the UV, 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). If the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes, which is up to about 1000 nm (1 micrometer), which is 10000 Angstroms. So if 1216*(1+z) is less than or equal to 10000, then it's in the optical.

Let me compute (1 + z) = 10000 / 1216 ≈ 8.224 → z ≈7.224. So if the cloud's redshift is higher than 7.224, the observed wavelength is beyond 10000 Angstroms (1 micrometer), which is beyond what ground-based optical telescopes can see. So to be detected, the cloud's redshift must be less than or equal to about 7.224?

Wait no, wait. Wait, if z_cloud is higher, then the observed wavelength is longer. So for the observed wavelength to be within the optical, the cloud's redshift must be less than 7.224. So the lower limit on the redshift would be zero, but that's not the case here. Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, no, the lower limit would be the minimum redshift where the Lyman alpha line enters the optical. But wait, as z increases, the observed wavelength increases. So the lower the redshift, the shorter the observed wavelength.

Wait, but if the cloud has a low redshift, the observed Lyman alpha is in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see because the atmosphere blocks it. So the cloud must be at a redshift where the observed Lyman alpha is in the optical, so that the absorption line is in a wavelength that ground-based telescopes can detect.

So the Lyman alpha line is observed at lambda = 1216*(1+z). We need lambda to be in the range detectable by optical telescopes. So what's the lower limit of the redshift such that lambda is in the optical. Let me think about the optical range. Visible light is about 400-700 nm. But ground-based telescopes can also observe near-infrared, up to maybe 1000 nm. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact limit. Let me check my memory: ground-based telescopes can observe up to about 1.6 micrometers (1600 nm) in the near-infrared. So the maximum wavelength is around 1600 nm, which is 16000 Angstroms.

Wait, but that's a higher wavelength than the 1000 nm I thought earlier. So if the observed wavelength is up to 16000 Angstroms, then 1216*(1+z) <= 16000 → 1+z = 16000/1216 ≈13.16 → z ≈12.16.

But wait, the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So none of the options are as high as 12. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps I should be considering the Lyman-alpha forest, where the absorption lines are in the optical range, but the quasar itself is at a higher redshift.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the quasar's emission being in the observed frame. But the absorption line from the neutral hydrogen cloud is what we're looking at. So the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but the hydrogen cloud's absorption is at a particular wavelength that's in the quasar's spectrum.

Wait, so for the absorption line to be in the optical part of the quasar's spectrum, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical range (say, less than 1000 nm).

So 1216*(1+z) ≤ 1000 → 1+z ≤ 1000/1216 ≈0.8225 → z ≤-0.1775. That can't be, since redshift can't be negative. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about when the Lyman alpha absorption is at the optical wavelengths. Oh wait, wait a minute. Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far UV. So if the cloud is at a redshift such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical (say, 400-700 nm), then we can see it. So let's compute when 1216*(1+z) = 400 nm = 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, 1216*(1+z) =4000 → 1+z=4000/1216≈3.29 → z≈2.29. So a redshift of about 2.29 would bring Lyman alpha into the blue part of the visible spectrum (400 nm is violet). So any cloud with z higher than about 2.29 would have the Lyman alpha line shifted into the visible. Wait, no, wait. Because for z=0, it's at 121.6 nm (far UV). As z increases, the observed wavelength increases. So when z is just enough to bring the wavelength into the optical, that's when the observed wavelength is 400 nm.

So the equation is 1216*(1+z) = 400 nm → 1+z = 400/121.6 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit on the redshift would be around 2.29, because anything lower than that would mean the observed wavelength is still in the UV and not visible from the ground.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is slightly higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the lower limit would be around 2.29, which is closest to option C (2.4), but wait, 2.29 is less than 2.4. Hmm. So wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the cloud must have a redshift high enough that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical. So the minimum redshift is when the Lyman alpha is just entering the optical. So if the optical starts at 400 nm, then the redshift must be at least about 2.29. So any cloud with z ≥2.29 would have the absorption line in the optical.

So the lower limit would be around 2.29. But the options are 1.9, 2.4, 1.2, or 3. So the closest higher redshift is 2.4 (option C). So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal redshift is 2.29, so any z≥2.29 would be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal redshift would be approximately 2.3. So the possible answers are 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (option D). Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Wait, perhaps the question is about the lower limit for the cloud to be detected. So the Lyman alpha must be in the optical range, which starts at 400 nm. So when the cloud's redshift is such that 1216*(1+z) ≥ 400 nm. Because, when the cloud is at a higher redshift, the line is in the optical. So the minimal redshift (lower limit) is when 1216*(1+z) = 400 nm → z=(400/1216)-1≈0.328. That would be about 0.33. But that's way lower than the options given.

Wait, that can't be right because if z is 0.33, the observed wavelength is 400 nm (violet), which is in the optical. So a cloud with z=0.33 would have Lyman alpha at 400 nm, which is visible. But wait, ground-based telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere blocks UV. So the quasar's light would have the Lyman alpha absorption line in the UV, which telescopes can't detect. So I must be getting this wrong.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the rest frame and observed frame. Let's clarify: the Lyman alpha emission (or absorption) occurs at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud. When the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z). To detect this absorption line, it needs to be in the range that ground-based telescopes can observe, which is the optical range. So the observed wavelength must be in the range that optical telescopes can capture, which is about 400-700 nm (visible light) and maybe a bit beyond into the near-infrared.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical (say, 400 nm and above), the redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z) ≥400 nm → 1+z ≥400/1216 → 1+z ≥0.329 → z ≥-0.671. But redshift can't be negative, so z≥0. But wait, that's not possible, because that would imply that any object with z≥0 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical, but that's not true because the atmosphere blocks UV. So perhaps the correct approach is that the observed wavelength must be in the range that's not blocked by the atmosphere. So, the Lyman alpha line must be in the optical window, which is about 400 nm to about 1000 nm, or perhaps a bit higher in the near-infrared.

Wait, but wait. The quasar's light is being observed in the optical. The Lyman alpha absorption line from the intervening hydrogen cloud is somewhere in the quasar's spectrum. So if the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, the quasar is at a higher redshift, say z_quasar. The Lyman alpha absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Angstroms. When observed, this line must be within the optical range that the telescope can capture.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z_cloud) must be in the range that ground-based telescopes can observe, say between 400 nm and 1000 nm. So let's compute the possible z_cloud.

At 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), 1216*(1+z) =4000 → z=(4000/1216)-1 ≈ 3.29-1=2.29.

At 1000 nm (10000 Angstroms), 1216*(1+z)=10000 → z≈ (10000/1216)-1≈8.224-1=7.224.

So for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical (400-1000 nm), the cloud's redshift must be at least 2.29 and up to about 7.224.

So the lower limit on the redshift is 2.29. So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above this value, and option D is 1.9, which is below. So the lower limit would be around 2.3, so the correct option is C) 2.4.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the math. 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm. So 4000 = 1216*(1+z) → z = (4000/1216) -1. Let's compute 4000/1216.

1216 × 3 = 3648. 4000 -3648=352. 352/1216 = 0.289 approx. So 3.289 → z=2.289. So the lower limit is about 2.29. So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.3. So the options are 2.4 and 1.9. So the correct option would be 2.4, as it's the smallest redshift that ensures the Lyman alpha is in the optical.

Wait, but why isn't 1.9 sufficient? Let's compute 1.9. 1 +1.9=2.9 → 1216 *2.9 = 3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.64 nm, which is in the UV. So ground-based telescopes can't observe that. So z=1.9 would result in the Lyman alpha line being at 3526.4 Angstroms (352.64 nm), which is UV, undetectable from the ground. Thus, the cloud must have a redshift high enough that 1216*(1+z) ≥4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So the minimal z is 2.29. Since none of the options are exactly 2.29, the closest higher option is 2.4 (option C).

So the answer should be option C)2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms (~121.6 nm) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the relationship between redshift and observed wavelength. The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\) (121.6 nm) is the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman alpha line, and \(z\) is the redshift of the cloud. For the absorption line to be detectable by optical ground-based telescopes, \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) must fall within the optical range, which is approximately \(400 \, \text{nm}\) to \(1000 \, \text{nm}\) (or \(4000 \, \text{Å}\) to \(10000 \, \text{Å}\)).

### Step 1: Calculate the minimum redshift
To ensure the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range, we set \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}\) (the lower bound of the optical range). Solving for \(z\):

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
\]

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \geq 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift required for the Lyman alpha line to enter the optical range is approximately \(z \geq 2.29\).

### Step 2: Analyze the options
The given options are:
- **A) 3**
- **B) 1.2**
- **C) 2.4**
- **D) 1.9**

- **Option A (3):** This is higher than the calculated minimum redshift (\(2.29\)), so it satisfies the condition. However, it is not the smallest possible value.
- **Option B (1.2):** This is lower than \(2.29\), meaning the Lyman alpha line would be in the UV range (\(1216 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 2915.2 \, \text{Å} \approx 291.5 \, \text{nm}\)), which is undetectable by optical ground-based telescopes.
- **Option C (2.4):** This is slightly higher than the calculated minimum redshift (\(2.29\)) and ensures the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range (\(1216 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 4128 \, \text{Å} \approx 412.8 \, \text{nm}\)).
- **Option D (1.9):** This is lower than \(2.29\), meaning the Lyman alpha line would be in the UV range (\(1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} \approx 352.6 \, \text{nm}\)), which is undetectable by optical ground-based telescopes.

### Conclusion
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \geq 2.29\). Among the options, the smallest value that satisfies this condition is **C) 2.4**.
