Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, σ are the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction, but it's arbitrary. ε is an energy constant.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. When you take their dot product with a vector n, you're essentially doing a sum like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix then.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, for spin systems, there's a simpler way. I think the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ± something. Oh right, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when multiplied by a constant, the eigenvalues scale accordingly.

Let me think. The general form of a spin operator is H = a · σ, where a is a vector. The eigenvalues of such an operator are ±a, but wait, more precisely, it's ±|a|. Because the magnitude of the vector a determines the maximum eigenvalue.

Wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ · n. So σ · n is a vector dot product. Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of the vector in σ · n will be sqrt(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) times the Pauli matrices. But wait, no, because the Pauli matrices are each of magnitude 1 when multiplied by 1. So the operator σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1, because n is a unit vector.

Wait, but the entire Hamiltonian is ε times that. So H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. The eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, because when you have a spin-½ system, the spin component in any direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 multiplied by something. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, right! Because the Pauli matrices are related to the spin operators. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So each Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2 gives the spin components.

So the Hamiltonian here is H = ε σ · n. If I factor that, it's H = ε (σ · n). Since σ is the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1? Or is it ± something else?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So for example, S·n would be (ħ/2) (σ · n). The eigenvalues of S·n are ± ħ/2 because the magnitude of S is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of σ ·n would be (2 S·n)/ħ. So if S·n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, then σ ·n would have eigenvalues ±1.

So the eigenvalues of σ ·n are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H = ε (σ ·n) would be ε times that. So ± ε.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option B says +ε and -ε. So that would be the eigenvalues. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, let me think about the matrix. Suppose H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Each Pauli matrix has trace 0 and determinant -1, I think. But for eigenvalues, another approach: since σ ·n is a traceless matrix (because each Pauli matrix has trace 0), the sum will also be traceless. So the eigenvalues must be λ and -λ, such that λ + (-λ) = 0. Also, the determinant of σ ·n is (1)(-1) - (something?), wait, wait, the determinant of σ ·n would be (traced from matrix)? Alternatively, the eigenvalues of σ ·n are ±1. Because σ ·n is a unit vector in the Bloch sphere, so the eigenvalues are ±1. So H's eigenvalues are ±ε.

So the answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by analyzing the properties of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, weighted by the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), as the Pauli matrices form a traceless matrix system, and the eigenvalues of such a combination are determined by the direction of \( \vec{n} \) on the Bloch sphere. Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues remain \( \pm 1 \).

The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scales these eigenvalues by the constant \( \varepsilon \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \( +1, -1 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
**B)** \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \): Correct, as the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), and multiplying by \( \varepsilon \) gives \( \pm \varepsilon \).  
**C)** \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues do not involve \( \hbar \).  
**D)** \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues do not involve \( \hbar \) or scaling by \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Answer: B
