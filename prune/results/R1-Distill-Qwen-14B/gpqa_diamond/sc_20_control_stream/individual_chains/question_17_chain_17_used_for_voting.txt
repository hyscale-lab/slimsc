Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when a metal forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free ions depends on the formation constant, right? Let me think.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stoichiometric means that the ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? I think EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so each Ca would bind with one EDTA molecule. So the complex is CaEDTA^2- maybe?

The given K for the complex is 5x10^10. That's a big number, so the complex is very stable. So the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but in solution, the total concentration of EDTA includes the free EDTA and the complex. Oh right, but the problem says that the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], which is 0.02 M.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions. So [Ca²+] would be very low because K is large, meaning the complex doesn't dissociate much. So we can assume that almost all the Ca is in the complex form, and free Ca²+ is very little.

Let me set up the variables. Let's let [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let [Ca²+] be x, and [EDTA^4-] be y. But because the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, and assuming that all EDTA is either free or bound to Ca²+ (since other ions aren't mentioned), the total EDTA concentration is y + 0.02 M? Wait, no, because each complex uses one EDTA. So the initial EDTA concentration must have been 0.02 M? Or wait, no, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which implies that the total Ca is 0.02 M as well, assuming 1:1.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the formula for the formation constant. Rearranging the K expression to find [Ca²+].

K = [Complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But since the complex is 0.02 M, and the solution is 0.02 M of it, so [Complex] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that the EDTA is present as free EDTA and the complex. But wait, the problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so the moles of EDTA in solution would be equal to the moles of the complex, because each complex uses one EDTA. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, then the EDTA in the complex is 0.02 M, and the free EDTA would be y. So the total EDTA is (0.02 + y) M. But if the initial solution was made by dissolving the complex, then the initial EDTA is all part of the complex. Hmm, but that may complicate things. Alternatively, maybe we can assume that the free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex? Because K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [EDTA^4-] would be very small compared to the complex.

Wait, but looking at the K expression again: K = 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y) → x * y = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13.

But wait, the EDTA is total: [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [Complex], which is y + 0.02. But if the complex is 0.02 M and K is so large, then y would be very small compared to 0.02. So [EDTA_total] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the total EDTA is 0.02 M? Because the complex is 0.02 M, meaning all the EDTA is in the complex. Wait, that's not possible because some must dissociate.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it in terms of what's given. The problem says the solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. What is [Ca²+]?

The K expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). We have [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+], but we don't know [EDTA^4-].

But, the total EDTA in solution is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = [EDTA_total]. Wait, but in the problem statement, is the solution made by adding the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M? So the total EDTA in solution would be 0.02 M because each complex releases one EDTA when dissociating. So [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Hmm, or is it that the initial concentration of EDTA is the same as the complex, but in the solution, some of it dissociates?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, so the initial EDTA in solution is 0.02 M as the complex. That means that [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] come from the dissociation of the complex.

So, the dissociation is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The K for this reaction is given as 5e10. Wait, no, the formation constant is given as 5e10. So the formation constant (Kf) is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-})=5e10.

We can rearrange this to find [Ca²+] in terms of [EDTA^4-]:

[Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / (5e10 * [EDTA^4-])

But we also know that the total concentration of EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. So [EDTA^4-] = 0.02 - [CaEDTA^2-]. But wait, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, so [EDTA^4-] + 0.02 = 0.02 → [EDTA^4-] = 0. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, the total EDTA is the sum of the free EDTA and the complex. So if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and assuming no other EDTA comes from elsewhere, then [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] → [EDTA^4-] = [EDTA_total] - 0.02. But if the solution is only the complex, then [EDTA_total] would be the same as [CaEDTA^2-], which is 0.02 M. But that would imply [EDTA^4-] = 0, which can't be right because then the K equation would have division by zero.

Ah, I see where I'm getting stuck. Let's approach it differently.

Let me denote:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Let [Ca²+] = x.

Let [EDTA^4-] = y.

We have K = 5e10 = 0.02/(x*y). So x*y = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.

Also, the total EDTA is [EDTA_total] = y + 0.02 M.

But wait, in the solution, the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. The complex is 0.02 M, so the total EDTA is 0.02 M (from the complex) plus any free EDTA. Wait, no, because the complex is made from EDTA and Ca²+. So each complex has one EDTA. So the initial concentration of EDTA (before dissociation) is 0.02 M as part of the complex. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M, because that's all that's present. So [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = y + 0.02 = 0.02. That implies y = 0. But that can't be right because then [Ca²+] would be infinite, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the solution is made by adding the complex, which is 0.02 M. So the complex is in solution, and it dissociates a little into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But the total EDTA in solution is the same as the concentration of the complex because each complex releases one EDTA when dissociating. So, the total EDTA is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = y + 0.02 = 0.02 → y = 0, which doesn't make sense. That suggests that the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the complex is made with Ca²+ and EDTA. So when you have the complex in solution, the initial concentration of Ca²+ is 0.02 M as part of the complex, and the EDTA is also 0.02 M as part of the complex. But when the complex dissociates, it produces some Ca²+ and EDTA. So the total Ca²+ is 0.02 + x, but since x is very small, it's negligible compared to 0.02. Wait, no, that can't be right because the complex is the source of both ions.

Wait, maybe I should model this with the variables.

Let’s let the concentration of dissociated Ca²+ be x. So [Ca²+] = x.

Similarly, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x, because each dissociated complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, but that would mean that the amount of complex that dissociates is x. So the complex concentration is 0.02 - x. But x is very small because K is large, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So then, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x ≈ 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So x ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 = ~6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check. I assumed that [EDTA^4-] = x, same as [Ca²+], because each dissociated complex gives one of each. So x² = (0.02)/(5e10) → 0.02/(5e10) is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. So yes, that's correct.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the complex dissociates in a 1:1 ratio, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). The concentration of the complex is given as \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), so:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \(K = 5 \times 10^{10}\):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Let’s let the concentration of dissociated Ca²+ be x. So [Ca²+] = x.

Similarly, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x, because each dissociated complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, but that would mean that the amount of complex that dissociates is x. So the complex concentration is 0.02 - x. But x is very small because K is large, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So then, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x ≈ 2e-6.5 → Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So x ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 = ~6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check. I assumed that [EDTA^4-] = x, same as [Ca²+], because each dissociated complex gives one of each. So x² = (0.02)/(5e10) → 0.02/(5e10) is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. So yes, that's correct.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the complex dissociates in a 1:1 ratio, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). The concentration of the complex is given as \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), so:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \(K = 5 \times 10^{10}\):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
