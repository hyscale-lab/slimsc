Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to parse it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z for a given state. 

Alright, let's start by understanding the setup. We have an operator P with components P_x, P_y, P_z. The matrices for each are given. Oh, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis is diagonal for P_z, meaning P_z is diagonal in this basis.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So that's the state vector.

The question is to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z in this state.

I remember that the uncertainty ΔA is calculated as the square root of ⟨A²⟩ minus ⟨A⟩ squared. So for P_z, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, in an eigenstate of another operator, what's the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩? Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z, the expectation value of P_z might not be zero, but I need to compute it.

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Since the state is given as a column vector, and P_z is given in matrix form, I can compute these by matrix multiplication.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me write that down. The state vector, let's denote it as |ψ⟩, has components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So in matrix terms, it's a 3x1 vector.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, but wait. In quantum mechanics, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. So the state is a column vector, so the bra is the conjugate transpose.

But looking at the components of the state vector: the elements are real numbers, so the conjugate transpose would just be the transpose. Let's see: the state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So let me compute ⟨P_z⟩.

The matrix P_z is given as:

[ ħ    0      0    ]
[ 0    0      0    ]
[ 0    0   -ħ   ]

So it's a diagonal matrix with ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by P_z multiplied by the same vector.

Wait, but actually, the vector is a column, so the multiplication is:

First, P_z as a diagonal matrix, so when we multiply P_z by the state vector, each component is multiplied by the diagonal element.

Wait, no: It's (ψ†) P_z ψ.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, the components are straightforward.

Let me denote the components of the state as ψ = (ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃)^T.

So ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

Then, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ₁* * (ħ ψ₁) + ψ₂* * (0 * ψ₂) + ψ₃* * (-ħ ψ₃).

But since all ψ's are real, the conjugate is the same. So: ħ ( (-1/2)^2 ) + 0 + (-ħ)( (-1/2)^2 )

So that's ħ (1/4) + 0 + ħ (1/4) = (ħ/4 + ħ/4) = ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. Wait, the third term is (-ħ) times (ψ₃)^2. ψ₃ is -1/2, so squared is 1/4. So (-ħ) * (1/4) is -ħ/4. But since it's ψ₃^2 multiplied by (-ħ), so it's - (1/4 ħ). Hmm, but in the expectation value, it's [ψ^† P_z ψ], which is sum ψ_i^*(P_z)_{i i} ψ_i.

So for each term:

i=1: ψ₁^* * P_z[1,1] * ψ₁ = ( -1/2 ) * ħ * ( -1/2 ) = ( (-1/2) * (-1/2) ) * ħ = (1/4)ħ.

i=2: ψ₂^* * 0 * ψ₂ → 0.

i=3: ψ₃^* * (-ħ) * ψ₃ = (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → [ (-1/2) * (-1/2) ] is 1/4, multiplied by (-ħ) gives (1/4)(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

So the total is (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's compute each term again.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because for i=1: ( -1/2 ) * ħ * ( -1/2 ) → ( (-1/2) * (-1/2) ) = 1/4 → (1/4) ħ.

i=3: ( -1/2 ) * (-ħ) * ( -1/2 ) → ( (-1/2) * (-1/2) ) = 1/4 → 1/4 * (-ħ) → -ħ/4.

Adding them: (1/4 ħ) + ( -1/4 ħ ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? That's the expectation value of P_z squared.

Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each element squared. So the matrix P_z² is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] → which is same as [ ħ², 0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0, ħ² ]

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum over i of ψ_i^2 * (P_z squared)_{i,i}.

So, for each term:

i=1: (ψ_1)^2 * ħ² → ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

i=2: ψ_2^2 * 0 → 0.

i=3: (ψ_3)^2 * ħ² → ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

So sum is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, I should double-check the calculations.

Wait, the state is given as [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

So for P_z, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, I have:

sum i ( ψ_i * (P_z)_{i,i} * ψ_i )

So,

i=1: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

i=2: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) → 0.

i=3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → (-1/2) * (-ħ) is (ħ/2), multiplied by (-1/2) → - (ħ/4).

Wait, no, wait: (P_z)_{3,3} is -ħ. So,

i=3: ψ_3 * (-ħ) * ψ_3.

ψ_3 is (-1/2), so:

(-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (1/2)(1/2) * (-ħ) → (1/4)(-ħ) → -ħ/4.

So summing all three terms:

(1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So yes, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is:

i=1: ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (ħ^2) = (1/4) ħ².

i=3: same as i=1, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ². So 1/4 ħ².

Sum: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, so (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 )= sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ → ħ / sqrt(2). So option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ for the given state, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with elements $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i (P_z)_{i,i} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the components of $|\psi\rangle$ and $P_z$:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z)_{1,1} = \hbar$, so the contribution is $(-\frac{1}{2}) \cdot \hbar \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $(P_z)_{2,2} = 0$, so the contribution is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z)_{3,3} = -\hbar$, so the contribution is $(-\frac{1}{2}) \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Summing these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with elements $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i^2 (P_z^2)_{i,i}.
\]

Substituting the components of $|\psi\rangle$ and $P_z^2$:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $(P_z^2)_{1,1} = \hbar^2$, so the contribution is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)_{2,2} = 0$, so the contribution is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $(P_z^2)_{3,3} = \hbar^2$, so the contribution is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Summing these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
