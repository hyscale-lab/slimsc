Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out how much acid and base are present and see if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction would involve the acids and bases neutralizing each other, and any excess will determine the pH.

I think I should calculate the moles of each component first. Moles are calculated as Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters.

Let me calculate each one:

1. For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
   Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L.
   Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. For HCl:
   Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L.
   Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

3. For Ba(OH)2:
   Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L.
   Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total moles of H+ from the acids and total moles of OH- from the base.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, giving 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it will contribute 0.05 moles of H+ (assuming it doesn't react much, but wait, maybe it does when mixing with the base? Hmm, maybe I should think about the neutralization reaction.)

Wait, let's think about the neutralization. The H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. So the total H+ is 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 moles. The OH- is 0.18 moles.

So the acid will provide 0.13 moles of H+, and the base provides 0.18 moles of OH-.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Let's see how much is left after they react.

The H+ is 0.13, OH- is 0.18. So H+ will be consumed first. After reaction, the moles of OH- remaining would be 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles.

So the excess is OH- of 0.05 moles. That means the solution is basic. The pH will depend on the concentration of OH-.

But wait, I also need to consider the volume of the mixed solution. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix CH3COOH with a strong base, wouldn't the base (OH-) deprotonate the acetic acid? Because OH- is a strong base and would react with the weak acid.

Oh right! I think I missed that part earlier. So the Ba(OH)2's OH- will react not only with HCl (the strong acid) but also with CH3COOH (the weak acid). So the initial approach of just adding H+ and OH- isn't correct because the OH- will first neutralize the weak acid.

So I need to adjust my approach.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base.
2. Determine which acid and base will react first, considering their strengths.
3. Subtract the moles accordingly and see if there's any excess of acid or base.

So, the moles again:

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles
HCl: 0.08 moles
Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles → produces 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, OH- will first react with the weak acid (CH3COOH) because it can deprotonate it. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O

So, the moles of OH- will neutralize the CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. Since OH- is 0.18, which is more than 0.05, all of the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and the remaining OH- will be 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 moles.

Now, this remaining OH- will react with the strong acid HCl.

HCl is strong, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

The OH- will react with H+ from HCl:

H+ + OH- → H2O

The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08, and the moles of OH- remaining after neutralizing CH3COOH is 0.13.

So, the H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, no. Let me think. OH- is 0.13 moles after neutralizing CH3COOH, and H+ is 0.08.

So the OH- will consume all the H+ from HCl, because H+ is 0.08 and OH- is 0.13. So, the OH- left after that will be 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 moles.

So, the total excess OH- is 0.05 moles.

Now, the total volume is 1200 mL (1.2 L), so concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is log(1/[OH-])? Wait, no. pOH is -log[OH-], so:

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ Let's calculate that.

But wait, 0.04167 is approximately 4.167 x 10^-2.

So log(4.167e-2) is approximately (since log(4)=0.60, and log(4.167)= ~0.62, but since it's 4.167e-2, it's log(4.167) + log(1e-2) → 0.62 + (-2) = -1.38.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 0.04167 M is [OH-] = 0.04167.

pOH = -log(0.04167) → let me compute it.

We know that:

log(4.167 × 10^-2) → log(4.167) + log(10^-2) → 0.62 (approx) - 2 → -1.38.

Wait, no. Wait, pOH is negative log of OH-.

So, if [OH-] = 4.167e-2, then pOH = -log(4.167e-2).

Compute log(4.167e-2):

log(4.167) is about 0.6198.

So log(4.167e-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So pOH = 1.3802.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

So the pH would be approximately 12.62. Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait a second, but let me double-check the steps. Did I account for all the reactions correctly?

1. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles of OH-.

2. The OH- first reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), neutralizing all of it, leaving 0.13 moles of OH-.

3. Then, the remaining OH- (0.13) reacts with H+ from HCl (0.08 moles), neutralizing all of the H+, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05/1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH is approximately 1.38, so pH is 12.62.

So the correct answer should be A) 12.62.

Wait, but another thought: when Ba(OH)2 is in solution, it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-. So, 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

That part is correct.

Another point: when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it converts it into acetate ions. So the CH3COOH is neutralized, and the solution becomes a solution of NaOH (from Ba(OH)2) and the acetate ions, but since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, the solution is strongly basic, so the acetate may not hydrolyze much. But in any case, the excess OH- will determine the pH.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. The pH should be around 12.62, which is option A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains:

1. **CH₃COOH (acetic acid)**: A weak acid with 0.05 moles (calculated as \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} \)).
2. **HCl (hydrochloric acid)**: A strong acid with 0.08 moles (calculated as \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} \)).
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base that dissociates completely, providing \( 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \) (calculated as \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 2 \)).

### Reaction Sequence:

   - Moles of OH⁻: \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - After neutralization, all \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \) are consumed, leaving \( 0.13 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Neutralization of HCl by Remaining OH⁻**:

- Concentration of OH⁻:  
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH}^-}{\text{Volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
  \]

  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 \approx 12.62.
  \]

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out how much acid and base are present and see if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction would involve the acids and bases neutralizing each other, and any excess will determine the pH.

I think I should calculate the moles of each component first. Moles are calculated as Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters.

Let me calculate each one:

1. For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
   Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L.
   Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. For HCl:
   Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L.
   Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

3. For Ba(OH)2:
   Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L.
   Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total moles of H+ from the acids and total moles of OH- from the base.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, giving 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it will contribute 0.05 moles of H+ (assuming it doesn't react much, but wait, maybe it does when mixing with the base? Hmm, maybe I should think about the neutralization reaction.)

Wait, let's think about the neutralization. The H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. So the total H+ is 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 moles. The OH- is 0.18 moles.

So the acid will provide 0.13 moles of H+, and the base provides 0.18 moles of OH-.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Let's see how much is left after they react.

The H+ is 0.13, OH- is 0.18. So H+ will be consumed first. After reaction, the moles of OH- remaining would be 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles.

So the excess is OH- of 0.05 moles. That means the solution is basic. The pH will depend on the concentration of OH-.

But wait, I also need to consider the volume of the mixed solution. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix CH3COOH with a strong base, wouldn't the base (OH-) deprotonate the acetic acid? Because OH- is a strong base and would react with the weak acid.

Oh right! I think I missed that part earlier. So the Ba(OH)2's OH- will react not only with HCl (the strong acid) but also with CH3COOH (the weak acid). So the initial approach of just adding H+ and OH- isn't correct because the OH- will first neutralize the weak acid.

So I need to adjust my approach.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base.
2. Determine which acid and base will react first, considering their strengths.
3. Subtract the moles accordingly and see if there's any excess of acid or base.

So, the moles again:

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles
HCl: 0.08 moles
Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles → produces 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, OH- will first react with the weak acid (CH3COOH) because it can deprotonate it. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O

So, the moles of OH- will neutralize the CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. Since OH- is 0.18, which is more than 0.05, all of the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and the remaining OH- will be 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 moles.

Now, this remaining OH- will react with the strong acid HCl.

HCl is strong, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

The OH- will react with H+ from HCl:

H+ + OH- → H2O

The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08, and the moles of OH- remaining after neutralizing CH3COOH is 0.13.

So, the H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, no. Let me think. OH- is 0.13 moles after neutralizing CH3COOH, and H+ is 0.08.

So the OH- will consume all the H+ from HCl, because H+ is 0.08 and OH- is 0.13. So, the OH- left after that will be 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 moles.

So, the total excess OH- is 0.05 moles.

Now, the total volume is 1200 mL (1.2 L), so concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH is log(1/[OH-])? Wait, no. pOH is -log[OH-], so:

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ Let's calculate that.

But wait, 0.04167 is approximately 4.167 x 10^-2.

So log(4.167e-2) is approximately (since log(4)=0.60, and log(4.167)= ~0.62, but since it's 4.167e-2, it's log(4.167) + log(1e-2) → 0.62 + (-2) = -1.38.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 0.04167 M is [OH-] = 0.04167.

pOH = -log(0.04167) → let me compute it.

We know that:

log(4.167 × 10^-2) → log(4.167) + log(10^-2) → 0.62 (approx) - 2 → -1.38.

Wait, no. Wait, pOH is negative log of OH-.

So, if [OH-] = 4.167e-2, then pOH = -log(4.167e-2).

Compute log(4.167e-2):

log(4.167) is about 0.6198.

So log(4.167e-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So pOH = 1.3802.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

So the pH would be approximately 12.62. Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait a second, but let me double-check the steps. Did I account for all the reactions correctly?

1. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles of OH-.

2. The OH- first reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), neutralizing all of it, leaving 0.13 moles of OH-.

3. Then, the remaining OH- (0.13) reacts with H+ from HCl (0.08 moles), neutralizing all of the H+, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05/1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH is approximately 1.38, so pH is 12.62.

So the correct answer should be A) 12.62.

Wait, but another thought: when Ba(OH)2 is in solution, it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-. So, 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

That part is correct.

Another point: when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it converts it into acetate ions. So the CH3COOH is neutralized, and the solution becomes a solution of NaOH (from Ba(OH)2) and the acetate ions, but since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, the solution is strongly basic, so the acetate may not hydrolyze much. But in any case, the excess OH- will determine the pH.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. The pH should be around 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids and bases in the mixture. The solution contains:

1. **CH₃COOH (acetic acid)**: A weak acid with 0.05 moles (calculated as \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} \)).

Answer: A
