Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole or kilocalories per mole.

Wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me think about what each of these does. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, meaning it can donate two protons. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Oh right, it's a group 2 base because it's from Ba, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions.

So when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. The reaction is usually acid + base → salt + water. The enthalpy change here would be the heat of neutralization, which for strong acids and bases is typically around -57 kJ/mol (but I should double-check that value because sometimes it's given as -36 kJ/mol for strong acids and around -57 for others? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.)

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered to be about -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. But that's when you have a 1:1 acid-base reaction. But here, because there are multiple acids and a base, I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- to see which is the limiting reagent.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

First, HCl. It's 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters) → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 mol H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. It's 0.3 M in 300 mL. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M in 200 mL. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but in neutralization, each H+ reacts with an OH- to form H2O. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So the limiting reagent here is the one with fewer moles. H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the reaction will proceed with 0.2 mol of H+ neutralized.

But wait, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. Since HCl provides 0.1 mol, and H2SO4 provides 0.18, so the 0.2 mol needed will come from both. So 0.2 mol H+ is neutralized.

The enthalpy change (ΔH) would be the moles of H+ neutralized multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but wait. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+. So if the value is, say, -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized, then 0.2 mol would give ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, but my calculation gives -11.4 kJ. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh, because kcal and kJ are different units.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the units. The problem says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization' but doesn't specify the units. The options are a mix of kcal and kJ. Oh, so I need to make sure which units to use.

Standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given in kJ/mol. So if I use 57 kJ per mole, that would be about -11.4 kJ for 0.2 mol.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thing: maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see the net.

Wait, the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So after neutralization, 0.08 mol H+ remains, but that's unreacted. So the reaction only uses 0.2 mol H+.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57 kJ. So 11.4 kJ. But the options have -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Wait, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 11.4 kJ is about 2.726 kcal (11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.727). Hmm, but option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. If the reaction releases 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ, which is 11400 J. To convert to kcal, since 1 kcal = 4184 J, so 11400 J /4184 ≈ 2.725 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.72 kcal (since exothermic), which is option A.

But wait, some sources say the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ for strong acids and strong bases. Alternatively, sometimes it's given as approximately -36 kJ per mole of H+ for weak acids and strong bases, but in this case, both acids are strong, so 57 kJ is correct.

Wait, but wait another point. In the reaction, when H2SO4 is present, the first H+ is strong, and the second may be weaker. But in dilute solutions, both H+ ions are considered strong. So the 0.18 mol H+ from H2SO4 are both reactive. So the total H+ is 0.28.

Wait, but the amount that reacts is 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction produces 0.2 mol of H2O, with a ΔH of 0.2 * (-57,000 J/mol) → -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ. So that's about -2.72 kcal (since 11,400 J is 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal). So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options: option A is -2.72 kcal. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be way larger. Hmm, but wait, why is option B about 11.42 kcal? Because maybe the calculation was done using 2.725 kcal per 0.2 moles, which would be 2.725 *0.2 * 1000? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait another angle: perhaps I should calculate the stoichiometry correctly. Let's write the neutralization reactions.

First, HCl + Ba(OH)2:

HCl is a monoprotic acid, Ba(OH)2 is diprotic base.

The reaction would be: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So per mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of HCl are needed. So moles of HCl available: 0.1 mol. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

So, since the ratio is 2 HCl per 1 Ba(OH)2, you would need 0.2 mol HCl for 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. But you only have 0.1 mol HCl. So HCl is the limiting reagent here, and Ba(OH)2 is in excess.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, when mixing all three solutions, the neutralization could involve all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So perhaps it's better to compute the total H+ and total OH-.

Wait, maybe the neutralization would involve all available H+ and OH- reacting until one runs out.

So, the total H+ ions:

From HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol H+.

From H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 mol/L =0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH-:

Ba(OH)2 → 2 OH- per mole. Moles Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 mol/L= 0.1 mol. So OH- = 0.2 mol.

So, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The OH- is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 mol H+ will react.

So, moles of H+ neutralized: 0.2 mol.

Each mole of H+ gives a ΔH of -57 kJ. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. That's 11.4 kJ released, so ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal. But why is option B -11.42 kcal?

Wait, maybe the question is using a different standard value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Like, perhaps it's using -36 kJ per mole of H+. Because I think sometimes people approximate it as -57 kJ/mol for strong acid-strong base, but sometimes people use -36 kJ/mol. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the stoichiometry differently.

Wait, let me re-calculate using 36 kJ per mole of H+.

0.2 mol H+ * (-36 kJ/mol) = -7.2 kJ → in kcal, 7.2 /4.184 ≈ 1.72 kcal. So that's about -1.72 kcal. But that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which might produce multiple H2O molecules. Wait, but the neutralization is about H+ and OH- reacting regardless of the source.

Alternatively, perhaps the way moles are calculated is wrong. Let me recheck.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol.

So H+ total 0.28, OH- 0.2. So 0.2 reacts, leaving 0.08 H+.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ. So -11.4 kJ is the enthalpy change.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is approx 2.72 kcal, but why is option B showing a higher number?

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different enthalpy per mole. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes one H+ instead of two, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what they did.

If that's the case, H+ would be 0.1 (from HCl) +0.09 (from H2SO4) = 0.19. Then OH- is 0.2. So H+ is the limiting, but no, because H+ is 0.19 < 0.2.

Wait, but that would mean 0.19 mol H+ reacts, giving 0.19 *57 = 10.83 kJ. Which is about 2.58 kcal. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid or base rather than per mole of H+.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the neutralization is calculated per mole of the acid or base.

For HCl: 0.1 mol, reacting with 0.1 mol of OH- (since each HCl provides one H+ and each OH- neutralizes one H+).

Similarly, H2SO4: 0.09 mol, but each provides two H+, so each H2SO4 requires two OH-.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.2 mol OH-.

So let's think in terms of how much each acid contributes.

The available OH- is 0.2 mol.

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol. H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol.

So the OH- will first neutralize the HCl's H+.

So 0.1 mol OH- neutralizes 0.1 mol HCl, producing 0.1 mol H2O.

That leaves 0.2 -0.1= 0.1 mol OH-.

Now, H2SO4: each mole requires 2 OH-.

The remaining OH- is 0.1 mol, which can neutralize (0.1 / 2) = 0.05 mol H2SO4.

So 0.05 mol of H2SO4 is neutralized, giving 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 mol H2O.

Now, the remaining H2SO4 is 0.09 -0.05=0.04 mol, which can't react because no more OH-.

So the total H2O formed is 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy change would be based on the moles of H+ neutralized, which is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2 mol H+.

So again, 0.2 mol H+ * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is about -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches this.

So why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would imply that 2.72 kcal is not the correct answer, but perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy.

Wait, wait another thought. Maybe the problem uses the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of reaction as written, not per mole of H+.

For example, when HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be 2 × (H+ neutralization) → 2 × 57 kJ = 114 kJ, but wait, no. Because each H+ is neutralized, so for 2 HCl, it's 2 × 57 = 114 kJ.

Similarly, for H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. The enthalpy would be 2 × 57 (since 2 H+ per H2SO4) → 114 kJ.

But wait, perhaps each mole of HCl releases 57 kJ, each mole of H2SO4 releases 114 kJ, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 releases 2 × 57 = 114 kJ (since it has 2 OH-).

But that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires calculating the total moles of H+ neutralized and then applying the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, the initial approach gives 0.2 mol H+ neutralized → 0.2 × (-57 kJ) →-11.4 kJ. So option D is -16.0 kJ. Doesn't match. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is roughly -11.4 kJ in kcal.

So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.2 mol H+ × (-57,000 J/mol) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ. To convert to kcal: -11,400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ -2.72 kcal. So that would make option A correct.

But why is option B there? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Some sources might consider the enthalpy of neutralization as -36 kJ per mole of H+.

If so, 0.2 mol × (-36) = -7.2 kJ → approximately -1.72 kcal, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of reaction, considering the stoichiometry from the balanced equation.

Wait, let's think of the entire mixture:

HCl + H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → ?

Wait, but that's perhaps a more complicated approach. Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization is for all the H+ from all the acids and all the OH- from the base.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the total enthalpy change, regardless of the source of H+.

So, all H+ from both acids and the OH- from the base will react.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

OH- = 0.2.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57 kJ per mole.

So 0.2 moles of H+ reacted. So 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ. So that's -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is involving the dilution of the solutions, but that's probably negligible.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the net.

H+ = 0.28 mol.

OH- = 0.2 mol.

Net H+ = 0.08 mol.

But the neutralization is only for the 0.2 mol of H+ and OH-.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57) →-11.4 kJ.

Hmm. So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, but none of the options seem to match that except if the answer is presented in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, so the answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That's about 11.4 ×4.184 ≈47.8 kJ, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute.

0.2 mol H+ ×57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ.

In kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.725 kcal.

So the answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why is option B even an option? Let's see what -11.42 kcal is in kJ: 11.42 ×4.184 ≈47.7 kJ.

Which would require 47.7 /57 ≈0.837 mol H+ neutralized. But we only have 0.2 mol H+ neutralized. So that doesn't make sense.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that would imply a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed, which would be 57 kJ per 2 H2O molecules? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the total H+ and OH- and then the enthalpy per mole of reaction, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct option is option B, but I don't see why.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, only the first H+ is strong, and the second is weak. So, for the second H+, the enthalpy of neutralization is different.

But I'm not sure about that. For the purpose of this problem, I think it's safe to assume that both H+ from H2SO4 are strong and contribute 2 H+.

So, the initial calculation holds, and the answer should be -2.72 kcal (option A).

But another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting the use of 56 kJ per mole of H2O, but no, that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the wrong sign. But no, exothermic reactions have negative ΔH.

So after all this, I think the correct answer is option A, -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ ions contributed by the acids and the moles of OH⁻ ions contributed by the base:

1. **HCl (0.2 M, 500 mL):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (0.3 M, 300 mL):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, so it contributes \( 2 \times 0.09 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (0.5 M, 200 mL):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into \( 2 \, \text{OH}^- \) ions, so it contributes \( 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \), where 1 mole of H⁺ reacts with 1 mole of OH⁻. The limiting reagent is the species with fewer moles. Here, there are \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) and \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), so OH⁻ is the limiting reagent. Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) reacts.

The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of H⁺ neutralized. Therefore, the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

To convert this to kilocalories (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ):  
\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **option A**. The other options are inconsistent with the calculations or unit conversions.

**Answer: A**
