Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I want to make sure I understand it properly before jumping into calculations. Let me read through the question again.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are fast-decaying, traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So the key here is understanding how the Lorentz factor affects the distance the particles travel before decaying. Since they’re produced at the center, the maximum distance they can travel without hitting the detector walls is 30 meters. But because they decay, not all of them make it.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is gamma times the lifetime in the lab frame. Oh, right, the lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor. So the mean lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ0.

Now, the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. That's basically velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ. But since these are ultra-relativistic particles, their velocity v is approximately equal to the speed of light c. So L ≈ c * τ.

But τ is gamma * τ0, so L ≈ c * gamma * τ0. Alternatively, L = gamma * c * τ0.

Wait, but for our purposes, we can think of the decay length as being proportional to gamma. Because if gamma increases, the decay length increases.

In the given scenario, with gamma = 20, only one third of the particles reach the detector walls. That suggests that the decay length for gamma=20 is such that on average, only one third of the particles' decay lengths are longer than the detector's radius. So the detector's radius is 30 meters, and the decay length for gamma=20 is such that about one third of the particles live long enough to reach 30 meters.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The decay length L is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So if the detector has radius R, the probability that a particle travels more than R meters is the probability that its decay length exceeds R.

Wait, but for a particle moving at speed v, the time it takes to reach the detector walls is t = R / v. The probability that the particle decays after time t is the same as the probability that the decay happens after t, which for an exponential decay is exp(-t/tau). Wait, no, the survival probability is exp(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime.

Wait, but tau is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper mean lifetime. So the survival probability S is exp(- t/(gamma tau_0)).

But since t = R/(v), and v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles, t ≈ R/(c). So S ≈ exp( - R/(c * gamma tau_0) ).

But gamma tau_0 is the mean lifetime in the lab frame, which is tau = gamma tau_0. So S = exp( - R/(c tau) ).

Wait, but in the first scenario, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So S = 1/3.

So when gamma is 20, S = exp( - R/(c tau) ) = 1/3.

But tau is gamma tau_0, so R/(c tau) = R/(c gamma tau_0) = (R/(c tau_0)) ) * (1/gamma) = (R/(c tau_0)) ) * (1/20).

Wait, let me think about this differently. Let's define a quantity x = R/(c tau_0). Then, the survival probability S is exp( - x/(gamma) ).

In the first case, gamma is 20, and S is 1/3. So,

1/3 = exp( -x/(20) )

Taking natural logs,

ln(1/3) = -x/(20)

Which implies,

x = 20 * (- ln(1/3) )

Because ln(1/3) is -ln(3), so x = 20 * ln(3).

Wait, yes. So x is 20 ln 3. So x is R/(c tau_0) = 20 ln 3.

Now, in the second scenario, the desired survival probability is 2/3. So S = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = exp( -x/(gamma') )

Again, take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - x / gamma'

Multiply both sides by -1,

- ln(2/3) = x / gamma'

So,

gamma' = x / ( - ln(2/3) )

But x is 20 ln 3, so substitute,

gamma' = (20 ln3) / [ - ln(2/3) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator. ln(2/3) is ln 2 - ln 3. So - ln(2/3) = ln(3) - ln(2) = ln(3/2).

So,

gamma' = (20 ln3) / ( ln(3/2) )

Hmm, so let me compute that. Let me approximate the logarithms.

ln3 is approximately 1.0986.

ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma' ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055

Let me compute numerator: 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

Divide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.13.

Wait, so gamma' is approximately 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So the answer is A.

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning because I might have messed up any steps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. The decay length is proportional to gamma. So if one third of the particles with gamma=20 reach the detector, that implies that the decay length for gamma=20 is such that one third are longer than 30 meters.

Wait, but the average decay length is L = gamma * c tau_0.

Wait, no, L=gamma * v tau_0. For v ≈ c, L ≈ gamma c tau_0.

So the average decay length is proportional to gamma.

If with gamma=20, the average L is such that only 1/3 of the particles have L>30 m, that would imply that the average decay length is at around the 30 m mark for some fraction.

Wait, but perhaps using the relation between gamma and the survival probability.

Wait, another way: the mean decay length in the lab frame is L = gamma c tau_0.

The problem is that the particles are produced at the center. So the maximum distance they can travel is 30 m. The fraction that reaches the wall is the fraction of particles whose decay lengths are longer than 30 m.

So the fraction is the probability that L > 30 m.

Since L is a random variable with exponential distribution, the probability that L > R (R is 30 m) is exp( - R/(gamma c tau_0) )

Wait, no, because the decay length has an exponential distribution with mean L = gamma c tau_0.

Wait, the probability that a particle's decay length exceeds R is exp( - R/(L) ), where L is the mean decay length.

So for the initial case, with L_1 = gamma1 * c tau_0.

Given that gamma1 =20, and the probability is 1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp( - R/(L_1) )

Take natural log,

ln(1/3) = - R/(L_1 )

Multiply both sides by -1,

- ln(3) = - R/(L_1 )

So,

R = L1 * ln(3)

Wait, because L1 = gamma1 * c tau_0,

Wait, wait, no. Let me get that right.

Wait, the probability is S = P(L > R) = exp( - R/(L) )

So for the first case,

S1 = 1/3 = exp( - R/(L1) )

So,

ln(1/3) = - R/(L1)

Thus,

R = L1 * (- ln(1/3)) ) = L1 * ln(3)

So, L1 = R / ln(3)

But L1 is gamma1 c tau_0 = 20 c tau_0.

So,

20 c tau0 = R / ln(3)

Now, for the second case, we have S2 = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = exp( - R/(L2) )

So,

ln(2/3) = - R/(L2)

Therefore,

R = L2 * (- ln(2/3)) )

Which is R = L2 * ln(3/2)

Because ln(2/3) is negative, so - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2).

So,

L2 = R / ( ln(3/2) )

But L2 is gamma2 c tau0.

So,

gamma2 c tau0 = R / ln(3/2)

But from the first case, R = L1 ln(3) = (20 c tau0) * ln(3)

Substitute R into the second equation:

gamma2 c tau0 = (20 c tau0 * ln3 ) / ln(3/2)

Divide both sides by c tau0,

gamma2 = (20 * ln3 ) / ln(3/2 )

Now compute that:

ln3 ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma2 ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.13.

So gamma2 ≈54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we analyze how the Lorentz factor affects the survival probability of particles reaching the detector walls. The survival probability \( S \) is given by:

\[
S = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma c \tau_0}\right),
\]

where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the detector radius, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau_0 \) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Relating survival probability to Lorentz factor
For the initial case with \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), the survival probability is \( S_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau_0}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau_0}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau_0} = \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_1 c \tau_0 = \frac{R}{\ln(3)}.
\]

### Step 2: Applying the same relationship for the second case
For the second case, the survival probability is \( S_2 = \frac{2}{3} \). Using the same formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau_0}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau_0}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau_0} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_2 c \tau_0 = \frac{R}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \( \gamma_2 \)
From the first case, \( \gamma_1 c \tau_0 = \frac{R}{\ln(3)} \). Substituting this into the second equation:

\[
\gamma_2 c \tau_0 = \frac{\gamma_1 c \tau_0}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

Cancel \( c \tau_0 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{\gamma_1}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

Substitute \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \), and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20}{0.4055} \approx 54.13.
\]

### Step 4: Selecting the closest option
The closest value to \( \gamma_2 \approx 54.13 \) is **54**, which corresponds to option **A**.
