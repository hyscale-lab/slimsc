Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, some compounds might not be chiral despite having stereocenters. Oh right, like in meso compounds, where there are stereocenters but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Oh, and also, some compounds might have stereogenic elements that aren't chiral centers, like allenes or certain bridged structures, but I don't think that applies here.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, but with substituents. Let me think. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? No, wait. Butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2? Hmm, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2Cl)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, it's but-1-ene, so double bond between C1 and C2. So structure: C1 (Cl) attached to C2 (double bond), which has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond, with a methyl on the same carbon as the double bond. So, perhaps it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but if it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2? Wait, no, maybe I should think of the structure as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between CH2Cl and CH(CH3). So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but for optical activity, the compound needs a chiral center. But looking at this structure, is there a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is (Z) configuration. The substituents on C1 (Cl) and C2 (methyl). Wait, C1 has Cl, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so perhaps it's Cl on C1, with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So structure: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? But wait, but-1-ene has four carbons, so C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 and C4 would be CH2 and CH3 if not for the double bond. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1, methyl on C2, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, that's a single bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused, but regardless, the main point is whether this compound has a chiral center.

Looking at C2: it's connected to the double bond (so it's a sp² hybridized carbon). For a chiral center, a carbon must be sp³ and have four different substituents. Since C2 is double bonded, it isn't a chiral center. So this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's optically inactive. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the formula is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but that would be butene with Cl on C1, methyl on C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3). Wait, but in a double bond, C1 and C2 are each connected via double bond. So each of these carbons has two substituents. C1 has Cl, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Replacing one CH2 with Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, with a double bond. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but that would make C1 (CH2Cl) and C2 (CH(CH3)) connected by a double bond. So each has only two substituents apart from the double bond. So each can't be a chiral center because they don't have four different groups. So yeah, no chiral centers here. So this compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the structure. It's a hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So that's a furan derivative with a methano bridge between carbons 4 and 7, and the molecule is in a hexahydro state, meaning six rings are hydrogenated. The substituent is chloromethylene at position 8.

Wait, the substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2- as a group? Or maybe Cl connected via a double bond. Wait, chloromethylene is -CH2Cl? Or is it CHCl= something? Wait, no, chloromethylene is CH2Cl. Or, wait, chloromethylene would be a substituent where the carbon is attached to two Cls? No, wait, methylene is a CH2 group. So chloromethylene would be CH2Cl.

Wait, but in this compound, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene). So that's probably a CH2Cl group attached to position 8.

Now, the molecule is (3aR,7aS,E). So E configuration in the double bond. But the main question is whether this molecule has a chiral center.

The core structure is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So that's a bridged bicyclic system. The substituent is at position 8, which is probably in a bridgehead position.

Hmm, bridgehead positions can sometimes lead to bicyclic structures where the bridgehead atoms have certain configurations. If the substituent at position 8 is a CH2Cl group, is that group attached to a chiral center?

Wait, position 8 is attached to a bridgehead, which might be a carbon. If that carbon is a bridgehead, it might have four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

Alternatively, the substituent is chloromethylene (CH2Cl), which is attached to another carbon. Wait, chloromethylene is a group like Cl-CH2-, but as a substituent, maybe it's a CH2Cl group attached to a carbon, which might be in a bridge position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a double bond, like Cl=CH–, but that might be an allene or something else. But the description says chloromethylene, which is CH2Cl, so perhaps it's a single bond.

If the substituent is on a bridgehead, and that bridgehead is a chiral center, then the molecule would be chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think: bridgehead chiral centers can exist, but only if the molecule isn't in a situation where the bridgehead is part of a bicyclic system that doesn't allow it to be a chiral center. For example, in norbornane derivatives, bridgehead positions can sometimes be chiral centers if the substituents are different enough.

So, in this case, the substituent is chloromethylene (CH2Cl) attached to position 8. If that carbon (position 8) has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. Let's see: the groups would likely be:

- The CH2Cl group,
- The bridge (from the bicyclic system),
- Two other substituents from the bicyclic structure.

Wait, but wait, the substituent is at position 8; the bicyclic system might have several substituents. Let me imagine the structure: the core is 4,7-methanoisobenzofuran. So it's a fused ring with a furan-like structure and a methano bridge.

Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic structure with a bridge, and substituent at position 8 is a CH2Cl group. If position 8 is a bridgehead, then the carbon there would be attached to:

- The bridge (two adjacent bridge carbons),
- The substituent CH2Cl,
- And perhaps another group.

Wait, but bridgeheads are typically connected to three other atoms, so maybe position 8 is a bridgehead with four substituents. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on a bridge carbon that's a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent itself introduces a chiral center. For example, if the substituent is -CH2Cl attached to a carbon that's connected to three other different groups, making a chiral center.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. However, the fact that the substituent is at position 8 and the molecule has specific R and S configurations suggests that there's a chiral center there. So I'm leaning towards this compound being chiral, hence optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethyl, the structure becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but in the compound, the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3. Let me draw this: the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, because 2R and 3S would mean each has a methyl group.

But wait, when you have two substituents on adjacent carbons, can the molecule be a meso compound? Let's see: if the substituents are R and S configurations, do they lead to internal planes of symmetry?

Wait, the molecule is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH ?

Wait, wait, no. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, but with the configuration (2R,3S). So each CH(CH3) has a specific configuration.

But wait, let's consider the possibility of being a meso compound. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then despite having chiral centers, it would be achiral.

In this case, the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl groups. Let's imagine the molecule: the two central carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group, and the configurations are R and S, respectively.

Wait, if the configurations are R and S, but the substituents on both are the same (methyl), we have to see if the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If you have two identical groups (like methyl) on adjacent carbons, and their configurations are R and S, then the molecule might be a meso compound.

Wait, let me think about tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two R and S configurations on adjacent carbons, leading to a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, does that lead to a plane of symmetry?

Let me imagine the structure. Each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to the two COOH groups, two methyl groups, and the two CH2 groups.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

If C2 is R configuration and C3 is S, then perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, which would make it achiral, hence not optically active.

Wait, but in the meso case, the configurations would be arranged such that a plane of symmetry exists. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, leading to a plane of symmetry.

So in this case, if the configurations are R and S, and the substituents are the same (methyl on both), then the molecule might be a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral, hence optically inactive.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on the stereocenters are not just methyl. Each stereocenter is in a CH(CH3) group. The substituents on each stereocenter would be: for C2, the groups are -CH3, -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (from C3), and the hydrogen.

Wait, no, the groups on each stereocenter are:

For C2 (2R), the groups are:

- Two CH2 groups (from COOH groups on either side? Wait, no.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you have 2,3-dimethyl, each substituent is a methyl on C2 and C3.

So, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the CH(CH3) groups is a stereocenter.

Now, for each CH(CH3), the substituents are:

- The two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3),
- The methyl,
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so the substituents on each stereocenter are:

- One methyl,
- One hydrogen,
- And two different carbons (C1 and C3, which are each connected to COOH groups and other substituents).

But wait, the adjacent groups on C2 and C3 might not be identical. Let me think.

If the C2 is R, and C3 is S, and the substituents are methyl and hydrogen, is there a plane of symmetry?

Let me imagine the molecule. If you have a plane cutting through the center between C2 and C3, would the substituents mirror each other? Let's see: for C2, the groups would be methyl, H, COOH on one side, and CH(CH3) on the other. For C3, the groups would be methyl, H, COOH on the other, and CH(CH3) on the same side as C2.

Wait, perhaps it's not symmetric because the substituents are same on both. Wait, but maybe it still has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral despite the configurations.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Another approach: if the molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. So, for example, in meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, and a plane of symmetry exists, making it achiral.

In this case, the two chiral centers are adjacent, each with a methyl group. So, the substituents on each would be the same. Therefore, if the configurations are R and S, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, hence achiral. So, this compound (2R,3S) would not exhibit optical activity.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the substituents on the two chiral centers are not symmetrical, then it's not a meso compound and hence chiral.

Wait, in this case, the substituents at each stereocenter are a methyl, a hydrogen, and two different carbons. Wait, the two carbons are connected to the same groups, but perhaps they're in different positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are: on C2, the groups are CH3, H, COOH (on one side), and CH(CH3) on the other. On C3, the groups are CH3, H, COOH (on the other side), and CH(CH3) from C2.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question is whether (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. 

So, if the two stereocenters are mirror images, then the molecule could be a meso form. But what defines the presence of a plane of symmetry?

Let me imagine the structure. The molecule would be:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH

With R configuration at C2 and S configuration at C3.

If I draw this, the groups around C2 (R) would be arranged in a specific way, and around C3 (S) in another. 

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let's see: if you swap the substituents on C2 and C3, would that mirror the structure? I'm not sure. Alternatively, the methyl groups are on opposite sides, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not a meso compound, because the substituents on the stereocenters are not arranged symmetrically. 

Wait, another approach: how many stereoisomers are possible for this compound? The formula is 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. There are two stereocenters, so four possible stereoisomers. Among those, two would be meso forms. So (2R,3S) and (2S,3R), which may be the meso forms, while (2R,3R) and (2S,S) are the enantiomers.

So, (2R,3S) would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait, the question is about whether the compound is optically active. So if it's a meso compound, it's not chiral, so it won't show optical activity.

So, this compound is a meso form and thus not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   So, same molecule as the previous one but both stereocenters are R.

In this case, the configurations are both R. So, are these two stereocenters leading to a meso compound or a regular chiral molecule?

If the configurations are the same, R and R, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, so it would be chiral. Hence, this compound has two chiral centers without a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral molecule and thus optically active.

So, this compound is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexenol. The structure is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on carbon 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol).

Wait, the configuration is R. The alcohol group is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the molecule is a cyclohexene with an OH group on C1.

Now, the question is whether this compound has a chiral center. The OH is on C1, which is a secondary alcohol. For a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents.

So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,
- The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6),
- And the cyclohexene ring's substituents.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has the OH group. The fourth substituent would be the rest of the ring, which includes the double bond.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has two substituents: the OH group and the rest of the ring.

But wait, the ring is a six-membered ring, so for C1, the substituents are:

- OH,
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6),
- And the rest of the ring structure, which includes the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but in a ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons, so C1's substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And the rest of the ring.

Wait, but is C1 a chiral center? It needs four different groups. Let's see:

The substituents on C1 are:

1. -OH,
2. -CH2-C (which is part of the ring),
3. -CH2-C (on the other side),
4. And the rest of the ring, which includes the double bond.

Wait, but the ring is a cyclohexene, so C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups if the double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, no. Let's imagine the structure:

The ring is cyclohexene, so double bond between C3 and C4.

So, the structure would be:

C1: OH attached, connected to C2 and C6.

C2: connected to C1, C3, and another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the chair or boat conformation. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, think about the substituents around C1. If the substituents are:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And the double bond in the ring.

Wait, but the double bond is across C3 and C4, so C1 is not adjacent to it. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And a CH group (from C1's position in the ring).

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
- And a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Another approach: for C1 to be a chiral center, the four substituents must be different.

So, if C1 is connected to:

- OH,
- Two different ring carbons (like C2 and C6, which are each connected to different parts of the ring),
- And a hydrogen? No, because in a cyclohexene, C1 would not have a hydrogen.

Wait, wait, cyclohexene has each carbon in the ring connected to two other carbons and possibly a substituent. So C1 has:

- OH,
- Connected to C2 and C6,
- And perhaps another substituent? No, because in cyclohexene, each ring carbon is connected to two others, and any substituents are additional.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a ring with an OH on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2),
- C6 (which is CH2),
- And the rest of the ring, which is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And a CH2-CH2-CH2 group leading up to the double bond.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2-CH2...),
- C6 (which is CH2-CH2...),
- And the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. If the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, it must have a chiral center at C1. So the configuration is R, which implies that C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

So, yes, this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is s (which I assume is the same as R or S, but the exact notation may vary).

Now, the question is whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, or if it's chiral.

In a cyclohexane ring, substituents at alternating positions can lead to symmetry. Here, the three OH groups are on C1, C3, and C5, which are every other carbon, making them alternate around the ring.

This arrangement would create a trigonal symmetry. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but let me think: if you have substituents at positions 1,3,5 on a cyclohexane ring, the molecule might be similar to a benzene ring with substituents at every other position, which for benzene would make it symmetrical. But for cyclohexane, the conformation could affect this.

Wait, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration (s), but arranged symmetrically, the molecule might be a meso compound or have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all on the same face (cis), the molecule might be chiral. But since the configurations are all s, perhaps they are all in the same orientation.

Wait, but the question is about whether the molecule is chiral. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the ring, it might be a meso compound, hence achiral.

Alternatively, in a cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, the molecule may lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to consider a similar structure. For example, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triamine: if all three amino groups are in the same conformation (like all axial), the molecule is achiral. But if they are in different conformations, it might be chiral.

Similarly, if the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If all are axial, then the molecule is symmetric, hence achiral.

But wait, the configuration is (1s,3s,5s). I'm not entirely sure how that translates to axial or equatorial positions. But if all three OH groups are on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters. Each OH is on a carbon that's connected to three other carbons and an OH, so each is a stereocenter. So there are three stereocenters. But are they arranged in a way that makes the molecule achiral?

If all three stereocenters are in the same configuration, perhaps it's still a meso compound. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some of the stereocenters mirror images, leading to an overall achiral structure.

Wait, but with three stereocenters, it's tricky. Let me think of an example: 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If the substituents are all on the same face, the molecule would be chiral. But if they are arranged symmetrically, it could be achiral.

In this case, the substituents are hydroxyl groups. If the OH groups are all in the same configuration (like all R or all S), perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that a plane of symmetry exists, then it's not chiral.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions are mirrored across the ring, the molecule is achiral.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the molecule as a chair cyclohexane. If the OH groups are on C1, C3, and C5, which are all in the same chair positions (axial or equatorial), then the molecule could be symmetric.

For example, if all three OH groups are axial, the molecule would have three substituents pointing upward, which might create a plane of symmetry. Similarly, if all are equatorial, the substituents are all on the same face, but perhaps leading to a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric because the substituents are at every other position, leading to no plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering that with three substituents in a symmetric arrangement, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's a trigonal arrangement, it could be symmetric.

Hmm, perhaps this compound is not chiral because the substituents are symmetrically arranged, making it a meso compound. So, it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait, another thought: for a cyclohexane ring with substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if all substituents are the same and arranged in a way that their positions are symmetric, the molecule is achiral. But if their configurations are such that they don't mirror, it's chiral.

But in this case, the substituents are all -OH groups, and their configurations are all s (same). So perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. I'm a bit torn here.

Another approach: if the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, it's achiral. Otherwise, it's chiral.

In the case of (1s,3s,5s), if the substituents are arranged such that flipping the molecule would produce the same structure, it's achiral. But if not, it's chiral.

Hmm. For example, in a structure where each substituent is in a position that's mirrored by another, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is actually not chiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For example, if you have substituents at 1,3,5, and each is in the same configuration, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it achiral.

So, I think this compound is not optically active because it's a meso compound.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure: cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone.

Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no. Butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, but the structure is:

The carbonyl is at C1, so the structure is:

O
||
C connected to:
- Cyclopentyl group,
- CH(CH3),
- And two other substituents.

Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO. No, wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1, making the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, no, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2CH2CH2CH3. But in this compound, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, wait, butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone on C1. So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-Cyclopentyl?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's number the butanone chain:

Butan-1-one: positions 1 (C=O), 2, 3, 4.

So 1-cyclopentyl would be substituent on C1. But wait, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which can't have substituents except the carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is at C1, connected to a cyclopentyl group and another carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, a CH(CH3) group, and another CH2 group.

So, the molecule is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, not sure. But regardless, the key question is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking for chiral centers: any carbon attached to four different groups.

In this case, the carbonyl carbon is C1, which is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The other carbons: C2 is attached to the carbonyl group, a CH(CH3), perhaps a CH2, and the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, perhaps C2 is connected to:

- O=C-,
- A CH(CH3),
- A CH2 group,
- And a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, but the substituents on C2 would be:

- O=C- (probably a ketone, but that's a double bond, so not a substituent),
- Two CH2 groups,
- And a cyclopentyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, another approach: the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, but butanone is four carbons, so perhaps:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, but the positions are a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

In any case, looking for chiral centers. The C3 in the butanone chain would be CH(CH3), which is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH2),
- C4 (which is CH2),
- CH3,
- And the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no, the cyclopentyl is on C1, so perhaps the C3 is CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

In that case, the C3 (CH(CH3)) would have substituents:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH2 (from C4),
- CH3,
- And the rest of the molecule.

But that doesn't seem to have four different substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH2-C(=O),
- CH2-CH2,
- CH3,
- And cyclopentyl.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the C3 has:

- CH2-C(=O),
- CH2-CH2,
- CH3,
- And the cyclopentyl group.

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH2-C(=O),
- CH2-,
- CH3,
- And cyclopentyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether any carbon in this molecule has four different substituents.

The carbonyl carbon (C1) can't be a chiral center because it's double bonded.

C2: connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH2), and two hydrogens. So substituents are C=O, CH2, H, H. So no, not a chiral center.

C3: connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), CH3, and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, if C3 is connected to:

- CH2 (C2),
- CH2 (C4),
- CH3,
- And cyclopentyl.

Then the substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, and cyclopentyl. Are all four substituents different? CH2 from C2 and C4 might be the same. Wait, but C2 is CH2-C(=O), and C4 is CH2-cyclopentyl. So perhaps the substituents are different. Let's see:

- C2: CH2-C(=O),
- C4: CH2-CH2,
- CH3,
- Cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps C3 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So this compound would have a chiral center and thus be optically active.

Wait, but wait, the cyclopentyl group is a cyclopentane ring. So, the substituent on C3 is a cyclopentyl group, which is a large, complex group. So if C3 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: is the molecule symmetrical in any way? For example, if the substituents on C3 are mirror images, perhaps it's not chiral.

Alternatively, since the substituents are a cyclopentyl group, a methyl, and two CH2 groups (but from different positions), then perhaps C3 is a chiral center.

If that's the case, the compound is optically active.

Wait, but another point to consider: the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's not chiral. But I don't think so in this case.

So, I'm leaning towards this compound having a chiral center and thus being optically active.

Now, let's recap each compound and whether they are optically active:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No chiral centers → Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → Has a chiral center → Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Meso compound → Not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Two R configurations → Not meso, chiral → Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → Chiral center at C1 → Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → Symmetrical arrangement → Meso compound → Not optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → Chiral center at C3 → Optically active.

So, counting the optically active compounds:

- Compound 2 → Yes
- Compound 4 → Yes
- Compound 5 → Yes
- Compound 7 → Yes

Wait, wait, that's four. Did I miss any?

Wait, let me recount:

2: yes

4: yes

5: yes

7: yes

That's four.

Wait, what about compound 3: no

Compound 1: no

Compound6: no

So total of four optically active compounds. So the answer would be D)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of stereogenicity, and it is not a meso compound (a compound with stereocenters but a plane of symmetry, making it achiral).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The remaining carbons (C3 and C4) are also not chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The substituent at position 8 is a bridgehead carbon. The molecule has specific R and S configurations, and the bridgehead carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. This compound is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical substituents (methyl groups) on both stereocenters, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, unlike the meso form, the configurations (2R,3R) do not result in a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group is attached to C1, which is a secondary alcohol. C1 has four different substituents: -OH, two adjacent carbons in the ring, and the rest of the ring structure. This makes C1 a chiral center. The compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The hydroxyl groups are attached to C1, C3, and C5 of the cyclohexane ring. These positions are symmetrically equivalent, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, and thus **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not a chiral center due to the double bond. However, C3 has four different substituents: a methyl group, a cyclopentyl group, and two different carbons from the chain. This makes C3 a chiral center, and the compound is **optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
2, 4, 5, and 7.  

Thus, **4 compounds are optically active**.  

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, some compounds might not be chiral despite having stereocenters. Oh right, like in meso compounds, where there are stereocenters but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Oh, and also, some compounds might have stereogenic elements that aren't chiral centers, like allenes or certain bridged structures, but I don't think that applies here.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, but with substituents. Let me think. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? No, wait. Butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2? Hmm, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2Cl)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, it's but-1-ene, so double bond between C1 and C2. So structure: C1 (Cl) attached to C2 (double bond), which has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond, with a methyl on the same carbon as the double bond. So, perhaps it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but if it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH2? Wait, no, maybe I should think of the structure as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between CH2Cl and CH(CH3). So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but for optical activity, the compound needs a chiral center. But looking at this structure, is there a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is (Z) configuration. The substituents on C1 (Cl) and C2 (methyl). Wait, C1 has Cl, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so perhaps it's Cl on C1, with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So structure: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? But wait, but-1-ene has four carbons, so C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 and C4 would be CH2 and CH3 if not for the double bond. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1, methyl on C2, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, that's a single bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused, but regardless, the main point is whether this compound has a chiral center.

Looking at C2: it's connected to the double bond (so it's a sp² hybridized carbon). For a chiral center, a carbon must be sp³ and have four different substituents. Since C2 is double bonded, it isn't a chiral center. So this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's optically inactive. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the formula is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but that would be butene with Cl on C1, methyl on C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3). Wait, but in a double bond, C1 and C2 are each connected via double bond. So each of these carbons has two substituents. C1 has Cl, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Replacing one CH2 with Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, with a double bond. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but that would make C1 (CH2Cl) and C2 (CH(CH3)) connected by a double bond. So each has only two substituents apart from the double bond. So each can't be a chiral center because they don't have four different groups. So yeah, no chiral centers here. So this compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the structure. It's a hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So that's a furan derivative with a methano bridge between carbons 4 and 7, and the molecule is in a hexahydro state, meaning six rings are hydrogenated. The substituent is chloromethylene at position 8.

Wait, the substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2- as a group? Or maybe Cl connected via a double bond. Wait, chloromethylene is -CH2Cl? Or is it CHCl= something? Wait, no, chloromethylene is CH2Cl. Or, wait, chloromethylene would be a substituent where the carbon is attached to two Cls? No, wait, methylene is a CH2 group. So chloromethylene would be CH2Cl.

Wait, but in this compound, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene). So that's probably a CH2Cl group attached to position 8.

Now, the molecule is (3aR,7aS,E). So E configuration in the double bond. But the main question is whether this molecule has a chiral center.

The core structure is hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. So that's a bridged bicyclic system. The substituent is at position 8, which is probably in a bridgehead position.

Hmm, bridgehead positions can sometimes lead to bicyclic structures where the bridgehead atoms have certain configurations. If the substituent at position 8 is a CH2Cl group, is that group attached to a chiral center?

Wait, position 8 is attached to a bridgehead, which might be a carbon. If that carbon is a bridgehead, it might have four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

Alternatively, the substituent is chloromethylene (CH2Cl), which is attached to another carbon. Wait, chloromethylene is a group like Cl-CH2-, but as a substituent, maybe it's a CH2Cl group attached to a carbon, which might be in a bridge position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a double bond, like Cl=CH–, but that might be an allene or something else. But the description says chloromethylene, which is CH2Cl, so perhaps it's a single bond.

If the substituent is on a bridgehead, and that bridgehead is a chiral center, then the molecule would be chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think: bridgehead chiral centers can exist, but only if the molecule isn't in a situation where the bridgehead is part of a bicyclic system that doesn't allow it to be a chiral center. For example, in norbornane derivatives, bridgehead positions can sometimes be chiral centers if the substituents are different enough.

So, in this case, the substituent is chloromethylene (CH2Cl) attached to position 8. If that carbon (position 8) has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. Let's see: the groups would likely be:

- The CH2Cl group,
- The bridge (from the bicyclic system),
- Two other substituents from the bicyclic structure.

Wait, but wait, the substituent is at position 8; the bicyclic system might have several substituents. Let me imagine the structure: the core is 4,7-methanoisobenzofuran. So it's a fused ring with a furan-like structure and a methano bridge.

Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic structure with a bridge, and substituent at position 8 is a CH2Cl group. If position 8 is a bridgehead, then the carbon there would be attached to:

- The bridge (two adjacent bridge carbons),
- The substituent CH2Cl,
- And perhaps another group.

Wait, but bridgeheads are typically connected to three other atoms, so maybe position 8 is a bridgehead with four substituents. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on a bridge carbon that's a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent itself introduces a chiral center. For example, if the substituent is -CH2Cl attached to a carbon that's connected to three other different groups, making a chiral center.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. However, the fact that the substituent is at position 8 and the molecule has specific R and S configurations suggests that there's a chiral center there. So I'm leaning towards this compound being chiral, hence optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethyl, the structure becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but in the compound, the substituents are on carbons 2 and 3. Let me draw this: the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, because 2R and 3S would mean each has a methyl group.

But wait, when you have two substituents on adjacent carbons, can the molecule be a meso compound? Let's see: if the substituents are R and S configurations, do they lead to internal planes of symmetry?

Wait, the molecule is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH ?

Wait, wait, no. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, but with the configuration (2R,3S). So each CH(CH3) has a specific configuration.

But wait, let's consider the possibility of being a meso compound. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then despite having chiral centers, it would be achiral.

In this case, the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl groups. Let's imagine the molecule: the two central carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group, and the configurations are R and S, respectively.

Wait, if the configurations are R and S, but the substituents on both are the same (methyl), we have to see if the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If you have two identical groups (like methyl) on adjacent carbons, and their configurations are R and S, then the molecule might be a meso compound.

Wait, let me think about tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two R and S configurations on adjacent carbons, leading to a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents on C2 and C3 are both methyl. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, does that lead to a plane of symmetry?

Let me imagine the structure. Each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to the two COOH groups, two methyl groups, and the two CH2 groups.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

If C2 is R configuration and C3 is S, then perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, which would make it achiral, hence not optically active.

Wait, but in the meso case, the configurations would be arranged such that a plane of symmetry exists. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, leading to a plane of symmetry.

So in this case, if the configurations are R and S, and the substituents are the same (methyl on both), then the molecule might be a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral, hence optically inactive.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on the stereocenters are not just methyl. Each stereocenter is in a CH(CH3) group. The substituents on each stereocenter would be: for C2, the groups are -CH3, -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (from C3), and the hydrogen.

Wait, no, the groups on each stereocenter are:

For C2 (2R), the groups are:

- Two CH2 groups (from COOH groups on either side? Wait, no.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you have 2,3-dimethyl, each substituent is a methyl on C2 and C3.

So, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the CH(CH3) groups is a stereocenter.

Now, for each CH(CH3), the substituents are:

- The two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3),
- The methyl,
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so the substituents on each stereocenter are:

- One methyl,
- One hydrogen,
- And two different carbons (C1 and C3, which are each connected to COOH groups and other substituents).

But wait, the adjacent groups on C2 and C3 might not be identical. Let me think.

If the C2 is R, and C3 is S, and the substituents are methyl and hydrogen, is there a plane of symmetry?

Let me imagine the molecule. If you have a plane cutting through the center between C2 and C3, would the substituents mirror each other? Let's see: for C2, the groups would be methyl, H, COOH on one side, and CH(CH3) on the other. For C3, the groups would be methyl, H, COOH on the other, and CH(CH3) on the same side as C2.

Wait, perhaps it's not symmetric because the substituents are same on both. Wait, but maybe it still has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral despite the configurations.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Another approach: if the molecule has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. So, for example, in meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, and a plane of symmetry exists, making it achiral.

In this case, the two chiral centers are adjacent, each with a methyl group. So, the substituents on each would be the same. Therefore, if the configurations are R and S, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, hence achiral. So, this compound (2R,3S) would not exhibit optical activity.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the substituents on the two chiral centers are not symmetrical, then it's not a meso compound and hence chiral.

Wait, in this case, the substituents at each stereocenter are a methyl, a hydrogen, and two different carbons. Wait, the two carbons are connected to the same groups, but perhaps they're in different positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are: on C2, the groups are CH3, H, COOH (on one side), and CH(CH3) on the other. On C3, the groups are CH3, H, COOH (on the other side), and CH(CH3) from C2.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question is whether (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. 

So, if the two stereocenters are mirror images, then the molecule could be a meso form. But what defines the presence of a plane of symmetry?

Let me imagine the structure. The molecule would be:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH

With R configuration at C2 and S configuration at C3.

If I draw this, the groups around C2 (R) would be arranged in a specific way, and around C3 (S) in another. 

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let's see: if you swap the substituents on C2 and C3, would that mirror the structure? I'm not sure. Alternatively, the methyl groups are on opposite sides, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not a meso compound, because the substituents on the stereocenters are not arranged symmetrically. 

Wait, another approach: how many stereoisomers are possible for this compound? The formula is 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. There are two stereocenters, so four possible stereoisomers. Among those, two would be meso forms. So (2R,3S) and (2S,3R), which may be the meso forms, while (2R,3R) and (2S,S) are the enantiomers.

So, (2R,3S) would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait, the question is about whether the compound is optically active. So if it's a meso compound, it's not chiral, so it won't show optical activity.

So, this compound is a meso form and thus not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   So, same molecule as the previous one but both stereocenters are R.

In this case, the configurations are both R. So, are these two stereocenters leading to a meso compound or a regular chiral molecule?

If the configurations are the same, R and R, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, so it would be chiral. Hence, this compound has two chiral centers without a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral molecule and thus optically active.

So, this compound is optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexenol. The structure is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on carbon 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol).

Wait, the configuration is R. The alcohol group is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the molecule is a cyclohexene with an OH group on C1.

Now, the question is whether this compound has a chiral center. The OH is on C1, which is a secondary alcohol. For a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents.

So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,
- The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6),
- And the cyclohexene ring's substituents.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has the OH group. The fourth substituent would be the rest of the ring, which includes the double bond.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has two substituents: the OH group and the rest of the ring.

But wait, the ring is a six-membered ring, so for C1, the substituents are:

- OH,
- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6),
- And the rest of the ring structure, which includes the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but in a ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons, so C1's substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And the rest of the ring.

Wait, but is C1 a chiral center? It needs four different groups. Let's see:

The substituents on C1 are:

1. -OH,
2. -CH2-C (which is part of the ring),
3. -CH2-C (on the other side),
4. And the rest of the ring, which includes the double bond.

Wait, but the ring is a cyclohexene, so C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups if the double bond is elsewhere.

Wait, no. Let's imagine the structure:

The ring is cyclohexene, so double bond between C3 and C4.

So, the structure would be:

C1: OH attached, connected to C2 and C6.

C2: connected to C1, C3, and another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the chair or boat conformation. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, think about the substituents around C1. If the substituents are:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And the double bond in the ring.

Wait, but the double bond is across C3 and C4, so C1 is not adjacent to it. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And a CH group (from C1's position in the ring).

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6),
- And a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Another approach: for C1 to be a chiral center, the four substituents must be different.

So, if C1 is connected to:

- OH,
- Two different ring carbons (like C2 and C6, which are each connected to different parts of the ring),
- And a hydrogen? No, because in a cyclohexene, C1 would not have a hydrogen.

Wait, wait, cyclohexene has each carbon in the ring connected to two other carbons and possibly a substituent. So C1 has:

- OH,
- Connected to C2 and C6,
- And perhaps another substituent? No, because in cyclohexene, each ring carbon is connected to two others, and any substituents are additional.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a ring with an OH on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2),
- C6 (which is CH2),
- And the rest of the ring, which is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- And a CH2-CH2-CH2 group leading up to the double bond.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2-CH2...),
- C6 (which is CH2-CH2...),
- And the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. If the molecule is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, it must have a chiral center at C1. So the configuration is R, which implies that C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

So, yes, this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is s (which I assume is the same as R or S, but the exact notation may vary).

Now, the question is whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, or if it's chiral.

In a cyclohexane ring, substituents at alternating positions can lead to symmetry. Here, the three OH groups are on C1, C3, and C5, which are every other carbon, making them alternate around the ring.

This arrangement would create a trigonal symmetry. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but let me think: if you have substituents at positions 1,3,5 on a cyclohexane ring, the molecule might be similar to a benzene ring with substituents at every other position, which for benzene would make it symmetrical. But for cyclohexane, the conformation could affect this.

Wait, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration (s), but arranged symmetrically, the molecule might be a meso compound or have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all on the same face (cis), the molecule might be chiral. But since the configurations are all s, perhaps they are all in the same orientation.

Wait, but the question is about whether the molecule is chiral. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the ring, it might be a meso compound, hence achiral.

Alternatively, in a cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, the molecule may lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to consider a similar structure. For example, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triamine: if all three amino groups are in the same conformation (like all axial), the molecule is achiral. But if they are in different conformations, it might be chiral.

Similarly, if the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If all are axial, then the molecule is symmetric, hence achiral.

But wait, the configuration is (1s,3s,5s). I'm not entirely sure how that translates to axial or equatorial positions. But if all three OH groups are on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters. Each OH is on a carbon that's connected to three other carbons and an OH, so each is a stereocenter. So there are three stereocenters. But are they arranged in a way that makes the molecule achiral?

If all three stereocenters are in the same configuration, perhaps it's still a meso compound. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes some of the stereocenters mirror images, leading to an overall achiral structure.

Wait, but with three stereocenters, it's tricky. Let me think of an example: 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If the substituents are all on the same face, the molecule would be chiral. But if they are arranged symmetrically, it could be achiral.

In this case, the substituents are hydroxyl groups. If the OH groups are all in the same configuration (like all R or all S), perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that a plane of symmetry exists, then it's not chiral.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions are mirrored across the ring, the molecule is achiral.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the molecule as a chair cyclohexane. If the OH groups are on C1, C3, and C5, which are all in the same chair positions (axial or equatorial), then the molecule could be symmetric.

For example, if all three OH groups are axial, the molecule would have three substituents pointing upward, which might create a plane of symmetry. Similarly, if all are equatorial, the substituents are all on the same face, but perhaps leading to a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric because the substituents are at every other position, leading to no plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering that with three substituents in a symmetric arrangement, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's a trigonal arrangement, it could be symmetric.

Hmm, perhaps this compound is not chiral because the substituents are symmetrically arranged, making it a meso compound. So, it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait, another thought: for a cyclohexane ring with substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if all substituents are the same and arranged in a way that their positions are symmetric, the molecule is achiral. But if their configurations are such that they don't mirror, it's chiral.

But in this case, the substituents are all -OH groups, and their configurations are all s (same). So perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. I'm a bit torn here.

Another approach: if the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, it's achiral. Otherwise, it's chiral.

In the case of (1s,3s,5s), if the substituents are arranged such that flipping the molecule would produce the same structure, it's achiral. But if not, it's chiral.

Hmm. For example, in a structure where each substituent is in a position that's mirrored by another, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is actually not chiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For example, if you have substituents at 1,3,5, and each is in the same configuration, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it achiral.

So, I think this compound is not optically active because it's a meso compound.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure: cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone.

Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no. Butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, but the structure is:

The carbonyl is at C1, so the structure is:

O
||
C connected to:
- Cyclopentyl group,
- CH(CH3),
- And two other substituents.

Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO. No, wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1, making the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, no, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2CH2CH2CH3. But in this compound, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, wait, butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone on C1. So the structure would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-Cyclopentyl?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's number the butanone chain:

Butan-1-one: positions 1 (C=O), 2, 3, 4.

So 1-cyclopentyl would be substituent on C1. But wait, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which can't have substituents except the carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is at C1, connected to a cyclopentyl group and another carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon, a CH(CH3) group, and another CH2 group.

So, the molecule is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, not sure. But regardless, the key question is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking for chiral centers: any carbon attached to four different groups.

In this case, the carbonyl carbon is C1, which is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The other carbons: C2 is attached to the carbonyl group, a CH(CH3), perhaps a CH2, and the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, perhaps C2 is connected to:

- O=C-,
- A CH(CH3),
- A CH2 group,
- And a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, but the substituents on C2 would be:

- O=C- (probably a ketone, but that's a double bond, so not a substituent),
- Two CH2 groups,
- And a cyclopentyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, another approach: the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, but butanone is four carbons, so perhaps:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

Wait, but the positions are a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

In any case, looking for chiral centers. The C3 in the butanone chain would be CH(CH3), which is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH2),
- C4 (which is CH2),
- CH3,
- And the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no, the cyclopentyl is on C1, so perhaps the C3 is CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl.

In that case, the C3 (CH(CH3)) would have substituents:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH2 (from C4),
- CH3,
- And the rest of the molecule.

But that doesn't seem to have four different substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH2-C(=O),
- CH2-CH2,
- CH3,
- And cyclopentyl.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the C3 has:

- CH2-C(=O),
- CH2-CH2,
- CH3,
- And the cyclopentyl group.

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH2-C(=O),
- CH2-,
- CH3,
- And cyclopentyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether any carbon in this molecule has four different substituents.

The carbonyl carbon (C1) can't be a chiral center because it's double bonded.

C2: connected to C1 (C=O), C3 (CH2), and two hydrogens. So substituents are C=O, CH2, H, H. So no, not a chiral center.

C3: connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), CH3, and a cyclopentyl group.

Wait, if C3 is connected to:

- CH2 (C2),
- CH2 (C4),
- CH3,
- And cyclopentyl.

Then the substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, and cyclopentyl. Are all four substituents different? CH2 from C2 and C4 might be the same. Wait, but C2 is CH2-C(=O), and C4 is CH2-cyclopentyl. So perhaps the substituents are different. Let's see:

- C2: CH2-C(=O),
- C4: CH2-CH2,
- CH3,
- Cyclopentyl.

Wait, perhaps C3 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So this compound would have a chiral center and thus be optically active.

Wait, but wait, the cyclopentyl group is a cyclopentane ring. So, the substituent on C3 is a cyclopentyl group, which is a large, complex group. So if C3 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: is the molecule symmetrical in any way? For example, if the substituents on C3 are mirror images, perhaps it's not chiral.

Alternatively, since the substituents are a cyclopentyl group, a methyl, and two CH2 groups (but from different positions), then perhaps C3 is a chiral center.

If that's the case, the compound is optically active.

Wait, but another point to consider: the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's not chiral. But I don't think so in this case.

So, I'm leaning towards this compound having a chiral center and thus being optically active.

Now, let's recap each compound and whether they are optically active:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No chiral centers → Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → Has a chiral center → Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Meso compound → Not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Two R configurations → Not meso, chiral → Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → Chiral center at C1 → Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → Symmetrical arrangement → Meso compound → Not optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → Chiral center at C3 → Optically active.

So, counting the optically active compounds:

- Compound 2 → Yes
- Compound 4 → Yes
- Compound 5 → Yes
- Compound 7 → Yes

Wait, wait, that's four. Did I miss any?

Wait, let me recount:

2: yes

4: yes

5: yes

7: yes

That's four.

Wait, what about compound 3: no

Compound 1: no

Compound6: no

So total of four optically active compounds. So the answer would be D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of stereogenicity, and it is not a meso compound (a compound with stereocenters but a plane of symmetry, making it achiral).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The remaining carbons (C3 and C4) are also not chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The substituent at position 8 is a bridgehead carbon. The molecule has specific R and S configurations, and the bridgehead carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. This compound is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical substituents (methyl groups) on both stereocenters, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, unlike the meso form, the configurations (2R,3R) do not result in a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group is attached to C1, which is a secondary alcohol. C1 has four different substituents: -OH, two adjacent carbons in the ring, and the rest of the ring structure. This makes C1 a chiral center. The compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The hydroxyl groups are attached to C1, C3, and C5 of the cyclohexane ring. These positions are symmetrically equivalent, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound, and thus **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbonyl carbon (C1) is not a chiral center due to the double bond. However, C3 has four different substituents: a methyl group, a cyclopentyl group, and two different carbons from the chain. This makes C3 a chiral center, and the compound is **optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
2, 4, 5, and 7.  

Thus, **4 compounds are optically active**.
