Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para. The question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction of yield for six different substances. I need to arrange them in order of increasing para yield.

The substances are:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethy benzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, wait, each of these has different substituents. The bromine is in excess, so we're looking at monobromination only. But the directing effects will vary based on the substituent.

I think substituents can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups (like -CH3, -OCH3) are electron-donating, making the ring more reactive and directing the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH) are electron-withdrawing and direct meta.

Wait, but wait—some substituents are deactivating but still ortho/para directors? Or is that only for certain cases. Oh, right, nitro groups are meta directors because they are strongly deactivating. They withdraw electrons through resonance, so the ring is less reactive, and the substituent directs to meta.

Now, the substituents in the given compounds:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para director.
2) COOEt (ester group): I think esters are meta directors. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, but the oxygen in esters is connected via an electron-donating group (like O-R), but wait, no. Esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So the substituent is meta-directing. So the major product would be meta, but wait, wait—wait, the ester group is ortho/para director or meta? Or is it para?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group. So it deactivates the ring. So it's a meta director. So the main product would be meta-substituted. So para would be a minor product, but wait, no—wait, but in some cases, maybe the directing effect varies.

Wait, nitro groups are strong meta directors. So the substituent in 4) is nitro, which is meta. So para is not the main product.

Let me list each substituent's directing effect:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para. So when bromine adds, it'll go para and ortho. But in excess bromine, maybe it's more substitution? Or wait, in electrophilic substitution, the para and ortho positions are favored.

But in terms of para isomer yield, we're looking for the percentage of the product that is para. So for substituents that are strong para directors, the para isomer will be more.

Wait, but for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer will be less. So the key is to figure out for each substituent whether it's ortho/para or meta directing. Then, the para isomer's yield will depend on that.

Wait, but wait, even for ortho/para directors, the para position may be more favored. For example, in toluene, the para isomer is more than the ortho because of steric factors. So the substituent's effect is a big factor, but sometimes steric effects influence the major product. But the question is about the "weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer". So, the percentage of the product that is para.

So, for each substituent, the percentage of para isomer would be higher if the substituent is a strong ortho/para director, and lower if it's a meta director.

So let's go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): CH3 is an activating, ortho/para director. So the para isomer will be major. I think in toluene, the para isomer is the major, but not 100%. So high yield of para.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): The substituent is an ester group. I'm trying to remember: esters are deactivating, so they are meta directors. So the para isomer would be minor. Wait, but wait, is the ester group an ortho/para director or meta? I think ester groups are deactivating (electron-withdrawing) and meta directing. So the para isomer would be low.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is an ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing group that is activating? Wait, no. Chlorine is an electronegative atom, so it's deactivating. But because it's ortho/para, it's a meta director? No, wait. Wait, wait. Chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Because Cl has lone pairs which can donate electrons (activating), but the inductive effect (electron-withdrawing) is stronger. So overall, it's deactivating, but the lone pairs can still direct. So Cl is ortho/para director, but deactivating. So in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is major. So high yield of para.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for chlorobenzene, the substituent is ortho/para directing but deactivating. So the ring is less reactive than benzene. So the para isomer is formed, but perhaps less than if it were activating.

But compared to other substituents, the para would be in higher proportion than meta.

Wait, but for nitro groups (4), the substituent is meta, so para is minor.

So let's list each substituent's para isomer yield from highest to lowest:

High para: substituents that are ortho/para directors (even if deactivating) would lead to higher para yields. But wait, activating groups (like CH3) would have higher yields in para, but deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl) would have lower overall para yields compared to activating but still ortho/para.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the substituent's directing effect and their effect on the para yield.

Substituents that are activating and ortho/para (like CH3): high para yield.

Substituents that are deactivating and ortho/para (like Cl): lower para yield compared to activating, but higher than meta directors.

Substituents that are meta directors (like NO2, COOH, COOEt): low para yield.

Wait, but wait, which substituents are meta directors:

- NO2: meta
- COOH: meta (carboxylic acid is deactivating, meta director)
- COOEt: similarly, esters are deactivating, meta directors.

So:

Substituent   |  Director
--------------------------------
CH3          | ortho/para (activating)
COOEt        | meta (deactivating)
Cl           | ortho/para (deactivating)
NO2          | meta (deactivating)
C2H5         | ortho/para (activating)
COOH         | meta (deactivating)

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. 

Esters (COOEt): deactivating, meta director. Correct.

Chlorine (Cl): deactivating, but ortho/para director because the lone pairs can donate via resonance. So Cl is ortho/para.

Now, when substituents are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is usually major, but sometimes ortho can be more than para, but in many cases, para is more because of steric hindrance in ortho.

So for each substituent, their para yield:

1) CH3 (toluene): high para (activating, ortho/para)
3) Cl: para is major, but lower reactivity than CH3 but still higher than meta directors.
5) C2H5 (ethyl benzene): activating, ortho/para director, so high para.

Substituents 2,4,6: meta directors—so para would be minor, but let's see which meta directors have higher or lower para yields.

Wait, but wait, for meta directors, the substituent doesn't direct to para. So the incoming Br would go meta. So in that case, the para would not be a major product. So for meta directors, the para isomer's yield is low.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So substituents that are meta directors would have less para, but maybe not zero. So, perhaps the para is formed, but in lesser amounts.

So which substituents are meta directors: 2 (COOEt),4 (NO2),6 (COOH).

Now, for the substituents that are ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para isomer is more. But which of these ortho/para directors have higher or lower para yields?

For example, in toluene (1), the para isomer is major. In chlorobenzene (3), the para isomer is also major but perhaps lower than toluene because Cl is deactivating. Similarly, ethyl benzene (5) would have a high para yield.

So, order of para yields for substituents 1,3,5: 1>5>3? Or 5>1>3? Or 1>3>5? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Let me think.

Wait, activating groups increase the rate of substitution. So toluene (CH3) is activating, so it's more reactive than benzene. So the para isomer is formed in higher amount. For chlorobenzene (Cl), it's deactivating, so the substitution occurs, but the ring is less reactive. But as an ortho/para director, the para is still formed, but perhaps in lower proportion compared to an activating group.

Similarly, ethyl group (C2H5) is also activating, so ethyl benzene (5) would have a high para yield. So perhaps the order of para yields among 1,3,5 is 5>1>3, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but wait. The activating groups (CH3, C2H5) are stronger in activating than Cl (which is deactivating). So for CH3 and C2H5, the para would be more than in Cl.

Wait, perhaps the order is: 5 (ethyl) > 1 (methyl) > 3 (Cl). Because ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. In aromatic substitution, the activating effect is more pronounced for groups that donate electrons. Alkyl groups (like CH3, C2H5) are activating. The order of activating effect is: -OCH3 > -NH2 > -CH3 > -C2H5. Wait, no, actually, larger alkyl groups are weaker activating? Or stronger? Because the inductive effect is weaker for larger groups. Wait, no, the inductive effect is about the ability to donate electrons through sigma bonds.

Wait, perhaps methyl is more activating than ethyl because methyl is closer and has higher electron density. Or perhaps ethyl is more activating because it's a larger group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the para yield is highest for the strongest activating groups. So for 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5), which is more activating? Probably CH3 is more activating than C2H5, because the methyl group is smaller and can donate electrons more effectively. So in that case, toluene (1) would have a higher para yield than ethyl benzene (5). But wait, I'm not sure—I might have this reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents with higher electron density have more activating effect. So more substituents have higher electron-donating ability.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relative activating strength. For example, -NH2 is a strong activating group, more than -OCH3, which is more than -CH3, etc. So among the substituents given, which are activating groups: CH3, C2H5. Which is more activating? I think methyl is more activating than ethyl because the inductive effect is stronger when the group is closer. So methyl (CH3) is a stronger activating group compared to ethyl (C2H5). So substituent 1 (CH3) would have higher para yield than substituent 5 (C2H5).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. It's possible that larger substituents (like ethyl) are ortho directors more so than para, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps for the para yield, the order among 1,3,5 is 3 <1<5. Because Cl is deactivating, so lower than activating groups. And among activating groups, maybe ethyl is more activating than methyl, leading to higher para in 5 than 1.

Wait, let me think. I've read that in benzene derivatives, the activating effect of alkyl groups increases with the size of the group. So ethyl is more activating than methyl? Or is it the opposite? Because methyl is smaller, so the inductive effect is stronger, making it more activating.

Wait, no. The inductive effect is about the ability to donate electrons via sigma bonds. So the larger the alkyl group, the weaker the inductive effect because the electrons are further away. So methyl would have a stronger inductive effect than ethyl, making it more activating. So substituent 1 (CH3) would have a higher para yield than substituent 5 (C2H5).

So substituents in order of para yield (highest to lowest): 1 >5>3.

Now, the substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) would have lower para yields. But how do their para yields compare among themselves?

Hmm, the substituents 2 (COOEt),4 (NO2),6 (COOH) are all meta directors. So the para isomer would be minor.

But wait, some substituents are strongly deactivating, which might reduce the rate of substitution, but if the substituent is a meta director, then para is not a major product.

But let's think about the relative strengths of these substituents as directors.

Nitro group (NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta director. So in nitrobenzene (4), the para isomer would be very low.

Benzoic acid (COOH) is also a strong deactivating, meta director. So in 6, the para isomer would be low, but perhaps higher than nitro because COOH is slightly less deactivating than NO2?

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the strength of the deactivating effect determines how much the ring is deactivated, but not necessarily the para yield. Since all are meta directors, the para yield is low. But perhaps in some cases, para might form more than others among meta directors.

Alternatively, perhaps for substituents that are deactivating and meta directors, the para isomer is formed less, but the actual amount depends on the substituent's influence. For example, if a substituent is strongly deactivating, maybe the ring is less reactive, so even less para product is formed.

Wait, but the para product is formed regardless of the substituent's activation; it's just the position. If the substituent is a meta director, the incoming Br would go meta. So for all meta directors, the para would be minor. But perhaps the substituents' activating or deactivating nature affects the overall reactivity but not the position much.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer is not a major product. So the para yield is low.

But among the meta directors, which substituent would allow more para formation? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe it's about the possibility of para position being more hindered or not. For example, a meta director may allow some para formation, but it's not the major.

Wait, perhaps the substituents that are deactivating but have ortho/para-directing effects (but wait, that's Cl and others) have higher para yields, while substituents that are meta directors have lower.

Wait, but in any case, the meta directors (2,4,6) will have lower para yields than the ortho/para directors (1,3,5). Now, the question is to arrange all six in order of increasing para yield. So from lowest to highest.

So the meta director substituents (2,4,6) would have the lower para yields, and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have higher. So the order would be the meta directors first, followed by the ortho/para.

But among the meta directors, which has the lowest para yield? I'm thinking nitro group (4) is the strongest deactivating, so the ring is least reactive, so para isomer would be the least in nitrobenzene. Then comes other deactivating groups like COOEt (2) and COOH (6).

Wait, perhaps the order among the meta directors is 4 < 6 < 2. Or maybe 4 < 2 <6? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the order is based on how strong the meta-directing is. But all are meta directors, so perhaps their para yields are low but in varying degrees.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the substituents that are stronger deactivators have lower yields of para. Since nitro groups are stronger deactivators than COOH, which is stronger than COOEt. So nitro (4) would have the least para, followed by COOH (6), then COOEt (2). So the order for meta directors from least to most para is 4 <6 <2.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Because COOH is a stronger deactivator than COOEt? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than COOH. COOH is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So nitro (4) would have lower ring reactivity than COOH (6), which in turn is lower than COOEt (2)? Or the opposite?

Wait, the order of deactivating strength is: nitro > carbonyl (like COOH) > ester (COOEt). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think nitro groups are stronger deactivators than COOH, which is stronger than COOEt. Because the NO2 group has a strong -I effect, and resonance to withdraw more electrons. COOH has a strong -I effect from the COO- group, but perhaps not as strong as nitro. COOEt has a weaker deactivating effect since the ester oxygen can donate electrons through resonance in some cases. Wait, no, esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So the order of deactivation strength: 4 (NO2) >6 (COOH) >2(COOEt).

If that's the case, then substituents 4 has the least para yield, followed by 6, then 2. So in terms of para isomer's yield from lowest to highest, the meta directors are 4 <6 <2.

Then the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) would have higher para yields. Among them, let's order their para yields. Earlier, we thought 1 (CH3) has higher than 5 (C2H5), which is higher than 3 (Cl). So 3 <5 <1.

Wait, no, earlier I thought that 1 has higher para than 5. So the order would be 3 <5 <1.

So overall, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <5 (C2H5) <1 (CH3)

Wait, but wait, substituent 3 is Cl, which is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So its para yield would be higher than substituent 2 (COOEt, meta) but lower than substituents 1,5.

So the order would be: 

4 (NO2, para yield lowest) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <5 (C2H5) <1 (CH3)

Wait, but in the options, the order is being asked in increasing order, so the correct sequence is 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, none of the options match the order I thought. Hmmm. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me reevaluate.

Alternative approach: for para yield, the substituent's nature determines the percentage. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is more. Among them, activating groups (like CH3) would have higher para yields than deactivating (like Cl). So for 1,5 (activating) and 3 (deactivating ortho/para), their para yields would be higher than meta directors.

So among 1,3,5, the order is 5 (C2H5) >1 (CH3) >3 (Cl). Or is it 5 <1 <3? Wait, earlier I thought CH3 is more activating than C2H5, so substituent 1 would have higher para yield than 5. So 1>5>3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the para percentages for each substituent.

Substituent | Para Yield (approximate)
-----------------------------------------
1) CH3 (toluene) | High, maybe around 50% or more.
2) COOEt | Low, say 10% or less.
3) Cl | Moderate, perhaps around 30%?
4) NO2 | Very low, like 5%.
5) C2H5 | High, maybe even higher than CH3? Or similar?
6) COOH | Very low, perhaps around 10%?

Wait, but earlier I thought that nitro has the least para. So 4 <6 <2 in their para yields (assuming 2 has higher than 4 and 6). But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the para yield order is:

Lowest first: 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3, which doesn't fit. Option D is 3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4, which also doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: when a substituent is a strong meta director, the para isomer is not formed much, while if it's a weak meta director, perhaps more para forms.

Wait, but meta directors don't direct to para. So the presence of a meta director leads to less para. So substituents 2,4,6 have low para yields.

Among these, which substituent would have the highest para yield? Maybe if the substituent is a weak meta director, perhaps some para is formed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the para yield. More activating groups lead to higher para yields, but deactivating groups lower it.

So substituents 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5) are activating, so high para. Sub 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so lower than 1 and 5 but higher than meta directors.

Sub 4 (NO2), 2 (COOEt), 6 (COOH) are meta directors, so their para yields are lower.

Now, which of these meta directors have higher para yields than others?

Wait, perhaps the deactivating strength affects the para yield. Strong deactivators (like NO2) would lead to lower reactivity, so lower para (but perhaps not directly related).

Wait, but all meta directors have low para yields. So the order among them would be based on their activating or deactivating strength. But since they are all deactivators, perhaps the order is based on which is a weaker deactivator—so less deactivating means higher reactivity, thus para is formed more.

So, if substituent 2 (COOEt) is less deactivating than 4 and 6, then it would have a higher para yield.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the relative deactivating strengths. Let's list them in order of deactivating strength: 4 (NO2) >6 (COOH) >2 (COOEt). Because NO2 is a strong deactivator, COOH is next, and ester is the weakest among them.

So, in terms of para yield, the weakest deact would have higher para yields. So substituent 2 has higher para yield than 6, which in turn has higher than 4.

So the order among meta directors: 4 <6 <2.

Then, the ortho/para directors would come next, starting with the least deactivating, so 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so its para yield would be lower than 1 and 5, which are activating.

So the order for ortho/para directors: 3 <1 <5.

Putting it all together, the overall order is:

4 (lowest) <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but let me double-check. So substituents with the lowest para yields are 4, then 6, then 2. Then come 3, then 1, then 5.

So in terms of the question, which asks for the order of increasing para yield, it would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which doesn't fit. Option B is 6<2<4<5<1<3, which doesn't fit. Option D is 3<5<1<6<2<4, which is the opposite.

Hmm, none of the options match this. Did I make a mistake in the order?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about substituent 3. Chlorobenzene (Cl) is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So its para yield is higher than meta directors but lower than activating substituents.

So substituent 3's para yield is higher than 2,6 but lower than 1 and 5.

So substituents in order from least to most para:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, because 4 should be first.
Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → No.
Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.
Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Wait, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my assessment of substituent 5.

Wait, substituent 5 is C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl benzene). Since ethyl is an activating group (meta director? No, ethyl is activating and ortho/para). So ethyl would have higher para yield than Cl.

Wait, but earlier I thought substituent 5 has higher para yield than 3. So in the order, 3 is after 5.

Wait, no. Wait, substituent 5 (ethyl) is an activating group, so para is major, higher than substituent 3 (Cl, deactivating). So 5 has higher para than 3.

So the order should be 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

Wait, but none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, the options available are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. That's in the order of 4,6,2,1,5,3.

But according to my analysis, it should be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Hmm, but this is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituents 3,5, and 1.

Wait, perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has a lower para yield than 1 (methyl). Because ethyl is a larger group, perhaps making the para position more hindered. So in ethyl benzene, the para position might not be as favored as in toluene.

So perhaps substituent 1 has higher para yield than 5.

In that case, the order would be substituents 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the actual products.

Substituent | Major Product
-----------------------------------------
1) CH3 → para is major
2) COOEt → meta is major, so para is minor
3) Cl → para is major, but substitution is slower
4) NO2 → meta is major
5) C2H5 → para is major
6) COOH → meta is major

So for the para isomer's weight fraction, the substituents would be ordered based on how much para is formed.

So substituents with para major → higher para yield.

So substituents 1 and 5 (para major) would have higher para yields than 3 (para major but lower than 1 and 5). Substituents 2,4,6 (meta major) have lower para yields.

But I'm not certain about the order among 1,3,5.

Wait, perhaps the relative rates are: 5 (ethyl) >1 (methyl) >3 (Cl). Because ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl, which is stronger than Cl (which is deactivating).

Wait, but earlier I thought methyl is more activating than ethyl. Now I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is 5 >1 >3, putting 1 after 5.

Wait, if substituent 5 (C2H5) has a higher para yield than 1 (CH3), then the order would be 5 >1 >3.

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the trend: the strength of activating groups. The order is:

Strong activating: -NH2, -OCH3, -CH3, -C2H5.

So, between 1 and 5: 1 (CH3) is more activating than 5 (C2H5). So substituent 1 has higher para yield than 5.

But that would place substituent 1 higher than 5, so the order 1 >5 >3.

Putting it all together, the order would be:

Meta directors (low para) → substituent 4 <6 <2.

Then, substituent 3 (Cl, ortho/para but deactivating).

Then, substituents 5 (C2H5, activating) and 1 (CH3, activating).

Wait, but that would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

But in the options, I don't see this.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So that's substituent 4 first, then 6, then 2, then 1, then 5, then 3.

But according to my analysis, substituent 3 should come before substituent 5.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the order of substituent 3 and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para yield than substituent 5 (C2H5), which is activating.

So substituent 3's para yield is lower than substituent 5, but higher than the meta directors.

So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

But this isn't an option. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating ortho/para director, so the para yield is lower than activating groups but higher than meta directors.

So substituents in order from least to most para:

4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOEt), 3 (Cl),5 (C2H5),1 (CH3).

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at the options, none of them match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <5 <1 <3. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But again, not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <3 <5.

But looking at the options, none match this.

Wait, perhaps I should try to see which option is the closest.

Option B is 6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3. So 6 is first, which seems incorrect because I thought 4 (NO2) has the least para.

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

So, in option C, substituents 4,6,2 are the meta directors in order. Then 1 (CH3), then5 (C2H5), then3 (Cl).

But according to my analysis, substituent 3's para yield is higher than 2,6,4 but lower than 1,5.

Hmm. 

Another approach: perhaps the para yield is highest for the strongest activating groups.

So substituents 1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5) are activating, so higher para yields than 3 (Cl, deactivating).

Substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so lower para.

Among meta directors, substituent 2 (COOEt) is the least deactivating, so higher para yield than 4 and 6.

So the order among meta directors: 4 <6 <2.

So the overall order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <5 <1.

But this isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, but substituent 3 has a higher para yield than 1 and 5? No, that doesn't make sense because 1 and 5 are activating.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in the electrophilic substitution reaction of bromine with the given substances, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either be activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and they direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para). The para-isomer's yield depends on the substituent's directing effect and its influence on the reactivity of the ring.

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: The methyl group (-CH3) is an **activating, ortho/para-directing** group. It increases the reactivity of the ring and directs the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Since para is typically favored over ortho due to steric hindrance, the para-isomer yield is high.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl Benzoate)**: The ester group (-COOEt) is a **deactivating, meta-directing** group. It withdraws electrons through resonance and inductive effects, making the ring less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position. Thus, the para-isomer yield is low.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: The chlorine atom (-Cl) is a **deactivating, ortho/para-directing** group. It withdraws electrons through inductive effects but donates electrons through resonance, making it an ortho/para director. However, due to its deactivating nature, the para-isomer yield is lower than that of activating groups but higher than meta-directing groups.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group (-NO2) is a **strongly deactivating, meta-directing** group. It withdraws electrons through both inductive and resonance effects, making the ring highly deactivated and directing the electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer yield is very low.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethybenzene)**: The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an **activating, ortho/para-directing** group. Like the methyl group, it increases the reactivity of the ring and directs the electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer yield is high, though slightly lower than toluene due to steric hindrance.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic Acid)**: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a **deactivating, meta-directing** group. It withdraws electrons through resonance and inductive effects, making the ring less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position. The para-isomer yield is low, though slightly higher than the nitro group.

### Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Yield:
- **Lowest para yield**: Substituents that are strongly deactivating and meta-directing, such as -NO2 (4) and -COOH (6), have the lowest para-isomer yields.
- **Moderate para yield**: Substituents that are meta-directing but less deactivating, such as -COOEt (2), have intermediate para-isomer yields.
- **Higher para yield**: Substituents that are ortho/para-directing but deactivating, such as -Cl (3), have higher para-isomer yields.
- **Highest para yield**: Substituents that are activating and ortho/para-directing, such as -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5), have the highest para-isomer yields.

Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:

**4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 5 < 1**

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5 → Incorrect, as 6 should come before 2.
- **Option B**: 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3 → Incorrect, as 4 should come before 6.
- **Option C**: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3 → Incorrect, as 3 should come before 5.
- **Option D**: 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4 → Incorrect, as 4 should have the lowest para yield.

The correct order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 5 < 1**, but none of the options match this. Based on the given options, **Option C** is the closest, though not entirely accurate.
