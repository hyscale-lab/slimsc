Okay, so I've got this question here about planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says there are two planets detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits. 

The transit method probably gives the size of the planet (because transit depth is related to planet size and star radius), and RV gives the mass. But the question is about equilibrium temperatures. 

Wait, equilibrium temperature—oh right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, considering the star's radiation and its own emission. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), I think. Or wait, maybe it's ( (L / (16 * pi * sigma * a^2 )) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity.

Wait, Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. So substituting that into the equilibrium temperature formula, T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4).

But wait, another approach. The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Since the planets are detected via RV and transit, we can maybe find their distances from the star? Hmm, but the question doesn't give their orbital periods or distances directly. Wait, maybe the RV method gives the mass and the orbit's period, but the question doesn't provide those numbers.

Wait, but the problem gives the Doppler shifts from each planet on the [OI] line. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's motion caused by the planet's orbit. The maximum Doppler shift is related to the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The shift is given in terms of wavelength change.

Wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately v/c. But the problem gives the shift in angstroms. Oh, wait, the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å.

So the velocity semi-amplitude K can be calculated from the Doppler shift. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So v = c * (Δλ/λ).

Where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s or 3e8 m/s. But let me think in terms of angstroms. The wavelength λ is 6300 Å, and the change Δλ is 0.03 Å for Planet1, 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So K1 for Planet1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, K2 is (0.04 / 6300) * c. 

Wait, but the actual calculation: Let me compute K1. 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = ~4.76e-7. Multiply by c (3e5 km/s) → 4.76e-7 * 3e5 = approx 0.1429 km/s = 142.9 m/s. Similarly, Planet2's K is 0.04 /6300 *3e5 km/s. 0.04/6300 is ~6.349e-6, times 3e5 gives about 1.905 km/s → 1905 m/s? Wait, wait, no, wait: 0.04/6300 is 4e-5 /6.3e3 → wait, let me recompute.

Wait, 0.03 /6300 = 0.03 /6300 = 1/210000 ≈ 4.76e-6. So 4.76e-6 * c (3e5 km/s) → 4.76e-6 * 3e5 = 1.428 km/s. Similarly, 0.04 /6300 is 4e-5 /6300? Wait no, 0.04 /6300 is (4e-2)/(6.3e3) = (4e-2)/(6.3e3) = (4/(6.3e5)) ) → 4 /630000 ≈ 6.349e-6. So K2 is 6.349e-6 *3e5 km/s = 6.349e-6 *3e5 = approx 1.9048 km/s.

Wait, but why are these velocities different? Because each planet has a different mass and semi-major axis. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the formula for K is K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) )? No, wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) )

But maybe a better approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps we can relate the K values to the planet masses and their distances. Alternatively, since the star's mass is given, and the planets' masses are known, maybe we can find the ratio of their orbital distances a1 and a2.

Wait, but maybe I can relate the velocities from RV to the orbital distance. Because, from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G(M_star + M_planet)) )

Assuming M_planet << M_star, which is likely, as M_planet is in Earth masses (like 7 Earth masses) and M_star is 1.5 solar masses (so much larger), so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star )

But for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Hmm, but perhaps another approach is to note that the Doppler semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ), because from Kepler's law, a^3 ∝ (M_star) P^2 / (4 pi^2), so a^(1/3) ∝ (M_star^(1/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) / ( (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) )

But maybe that's getting complicated. Let me think: since both planets are around the same star, and the question asks about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, which depends on the ratio of (R_star / a)^2, since T_eq is proportional to (L/(a^2))^(1/4), and L = sigma T_star^4 4 pi R_star^2. So L is proportional to R_star^2 T_star^4.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

Because L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. The flux at distance a is L/(4 pi a^2) = sigma T_eq^4.

So,

sigma T_eq^4 = (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 )/(4 pi a^2 )

Cancel 4 pi and sigma:

T_eq^4 = ( R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / a^2

Take square root both sides:

T_eq^2 = ( R_star T_star^2 ) / a

Take square root again:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-derive.

Flux from star at planet's distance: L/(4 pi a^2) = [4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ] / (4 pi a^2 ) = sigma T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2 )

Set equal to sigma T_eq^4:

sigma T_eq^4 = sigma T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2 )

Cancel sigma:

T_eq^4 = T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2 )

Take fourth root:

T_eq = T_star * (R_star / a )^(1/2 )

Ah, so T_eq is T_star multiplied by sqrt( R_star / a ).

So, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of (R_star / a). So for the ratio T1/T2, it's sqrt( (R1 a2)/(R2 a1) ) ), but wait, wait. Let me compute T1 and T2:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, no, let me correct that. 

Wait, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star / a ), so for each planet, T1 and T2 are proportional to sqrt( R_star / a1 ) and sqrt( R_star / a2 ), respectively. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( ( R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( a2 ) / sqrt( a1 )

But wait, that's the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures. So to find T1/T2, it's sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets, we can relate them through the RV semi-amplitudes K.

Because, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (something))

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3 )

Hmm, but since both planets are orbiting the same star, and sin i is the same (assuming same inclination; but since transit method is used, i ≈ 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1), perhaps we can relate K1 and K2 to the cube of (M_p / a^(1/2) )

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) )) ), because from Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

Wait, let me think: the RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

But M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But I also know from Kepler's third law that P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G M_star )

So, P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 )

Substituting P into the K expression:

K ≈ [ ( G * [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 ) ) / (2 pi c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Simplify step by step.

Let me compute the exponent:

Inside the first part of K's expression:

G * [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 ) 

= G * (4 pi^2 a^3 )^(1/2) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

= G^(1) * (4 pi^2 )^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

= (4 pi^2 )^(1/2) * G^(1 - 1/2) a^(3/2) ) / M_star^(1/2 )

= (2 pi ) * G^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / M_star^(1/2 )

Now, divide by 2 pi c^3:

So, (2 pi G^(1/2) a^(3/2 )) / M_star^(1/2 ) ) / (2 pi c^3 )

= ( G^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c^3 )

Now, take the cube root:

[ ( G^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c^3 ) ]^(1/3 )

= G^(1/(6)) a^(1/2) ) / ( M_star^(1/6) c )

Now, the entire K expression is this multiplied by ( M_p ) / M_star^(2/3 )

So,

K ≈ [ G^(1/6) a^(1/2) / ( M_star^(1/6) c ) ) ] * ( M_p ) / M_star^(2/3 )

Combine the M_star terms:

M_star^(1/6) * M_star^(2/3) = M_star^( (1/6)+(4/6) ) = M_star^(5/6 )

Wait, let me calculate exponents:

M_star in denominator is ( M_star^(1/6) ) * ( M_star^(2/3) ) = M_star^(1/6 + 4/6 ) = M_star^(5/6 )

So,

K ≈ [ G^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_p ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

So,

K = [ ( G^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_p ) ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

We can write this as:

K = ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(5/6) c ) ) * ( G^(1/6) a^(1/2) )

Alternatively, rearranged:

K ∝ ( M_p ) * a^(1/2 ) / M_star^(5/6 )

But since M_p varies between the two planets, and a is their semi-major axes, perhaps we can find the ratio K1/K2 in terms of M_p1, M_p2, a1, a2.

Wait, let me write the equation for each planet.

K1 = ( G^(1/6) a1^(1/2) M_p1 ) / ( M_star^(5/6) c )

Similarly,

K2 = ( G^(1/6) a2^(1/2) M_p2 ) / ( M_star^(5/6) c )

Dividing K1 by K2,

K1/K2 = [ (a1^(1/2) M_p1 ) ] / [ (a2^(1/2) M_p2 ) ]

= sqrt( a1/a2 ) * ( M_p1 / M_p2 )

But let's compute K1 and K2 from the given data.

We have K1 corresponding to Planet1's Doppler shift: 0.03 Å.

K2 is 0.04 Å.

So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75

So,

0.75 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7 /5 )

Because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses.

So,

0.75 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7/5 )

Let's solve for sqrt(a1/a2):

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 0.75 * (5/7 ) = (3/4) * (5/7 ) = (15/28 ) ≈ 0.5357

So,

sqrt(a1/a2 ) ≈ 0.5357 → square both sides,

a1/a2 ≈ (15/28 )^2 ≈ (225)/(784) ≈ 0.2867

So, a1 ≈ 0.2867 a2

Alternatively, a2 = a1 / 0.2867 ≈ 3.48 a1

Wait, but wait, that's a1/a2 ratio. So,

a1 = 0.2867 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.2867 ≈ 3.48 a1

Wait, but this is a1/a2 = (15/28 )^2.

Wait, let me compute 15/28:

15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357, so square is ~ 0.2868.

So, a1 is about 0.2868 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but which planet is closer? Since a1 is smaller, Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2.

But how does this relate to their equilibrium temperatures?

Earlier, we found that T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

So, for the ratio T1/T2:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the R_star cancels.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have a1/a2 ≈ 0.2868 → a2/a1 ≈ 3.48.

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt(3.48) ≈ 1.866.

Wait, but that's a problem because the options don't have such a high ratio.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recheck:

Wait, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, a2 is larger than a1, so the ratio is greater than 1. So Planet1 is hotter.

Hmm, but the options are: A) ~ 0.98; B) ~1.30; C) ~0.53; D) ~1.05. So option B is around 1.3, which is close to our preliminary calculation of ~1.86. Wait, that's not matching. So perhaps I messed up somewhere.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the K ratio.

Wait, let me recompute the K1/K2 ratio.

K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å.

So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75

Earlier, I had:

K1/K2 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7/5 )

So,

0.75 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7/5 )

Wait, 7/5 is 1.4.

So,

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357

Which gives a1/a2 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.2868.

So a1 is about 28.68% of a2, meaning a2 is about 3.48 times a1.

Thus, a2 is larger than a1, so a1 < a2.

So, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/(a1/a2) ) = sqrt(1/0.2868 ) ≈ sqrt(3.48) ≈ 1.866.

But the options don't have 1.8, so something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I confused which K corresponds to which planet. Let me read the question again.

"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å."

Ah, so K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04.

So K1=0.03, K2=0.04.

So K1/K2 = 3/4.

So earlier approach was correct.

Then, in our calculation, T1 is hotter than T2 by a factor of ~1.866.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the inverse when computing a1/a2.

Wait, the ratio K1/K2 is 0.75.

From earlier:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, no, earlier I said K1/K2 = sqrt(a1/a2) * (M_p1/M_p2 )

Wait, let me re-express.

Wait, K1 = [ G^(1/6) a1^(1/2) M_p1 ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

K2 = [ G^(1/6) a2^(1/2) M_p2 ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

So, K1/K2 = [ a1^(1/2) M_p1 ] / [ a2^(1/2) M_p2 ]

= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

Ah, yes. So K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

Given K1=0.03, K2=0.04 → K1/K2=3/4=0.75

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt(a1/a2 )

→ sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 0.75 * (5/7 )

0.75 is 3/4, so 3/4 *5/7 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

So sqrt(a1/a2) ≈ 0.5357 → a1/a2 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 225/784 ≈ 0.2868.

Thus, a1 = 0.2868 a2.

So, a2 is larger than a1. So the planet with K2 (Planet2) is farther from the star.

Thus, when considering equilibrium temperature, the closer planet will be hotter.

So, T1 is closer, so T1 > T2.

The ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 1/ sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 1/ sqrt(0.2868) ≈ 1/0.5357 ≈ 1.866.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are: 

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

Hmm, none near 1.8. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I confused the Doppler shift with velocity. Let me think again about how the Doppler shift relates to velocity.

The Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.

So, for a given velocity v, delta_lambda = v * lambda / c.

So, for a given K (semi-amplitude of velocity), the Doppler shift is (v * lambda ) / c.

Wait, but the question says the shift is up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So, the semi-amplitude of velocity K1 is:

K1 = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c

So,

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * c

Wait, wait, but this is for the observed Doppler shift.

Wait, but the formula for K is (v) = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute K1 and K2 correctly because I might have had a mistake in earlier steps.

So, K1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Wait, let me compute K1 and K2 in m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So,

K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s

= (0.03 /6300 ) * 3e8 m/s

0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = (3/6300) * 1e-1 → 0.00047619 → So 0.00047619 *3e8 = 1.42857e5 m/s? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait a second, 0.03 angstrom is 0.03e-10 meters. 6300 angstrom is 6300e-10 meters.

So,

K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s

= (0.03/6300) * 3e8 m/s

0.03 /6300 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = (3 / 6300 ) * 1e-5 → 4.7619e-6 → 4.7619e-6 * 3e8 = 1.42857e3 m/s = ~1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04e-10 m /6300e-10 m ) *3e8 m/s

0.04/6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 = 4/(630000) = ~6.3492e-6.

Multiply by 3e8 → 6.3492e-6 *3e8 = 1.90476e3 m/s ≈ 1905 m/s.

Wait, so K1 is about 1428.57 m/s, K2 is 1904.76 m/s.

So, the ratio K1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1904.76 ≈ 0.75.

Earlier, this ratio came out 0.75, which is correct.

So, using K1=1428.57 m/s and K2=1904.76 m/s, the ratio is 0.75.

So, same as before.

So, the earlier calculations about a1 and a2 are correct.

So, T1/T2 is ~1.866.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equilibrium temperature formula.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we used:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

But perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 1/2, so T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

But in any case, the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) * sqrt( (1- albedo_Planet1)/(1- albedo_Planet2) )

But the question states that both planets have the same albedo. So, the albedo term cancels out.

Wait, then the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), as before.

So, the same conclusion holds.

So, why is the calculated ratio not among the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for K. Let's re-examine the RV semi-amplitude formula.

The correct formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) * (1 year ) ) ) ]^(1/ something )

Wait, perhaps better to refer to the standard RV semi-amplitude formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

But P is the orbital period.

But another approach is to express K in terms of the orbital velocity v.

The orbital velocity of the star around the barycenter is v = K.

The star's velocity is given by v = (2 pi a ) / P, where a is the star's orbit radius (a = a_p * (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) ), but since M_p << M_star, a ≈ a_p * ( M_p / M_star ), where a_p is the planet's semi-major axis.

So, v ≈ (2 pi a_p M_p )/( M_star P )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a_p^3 )/( G M_star )

So,

P = 2 pi (a_p^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into the expression for v:

v ≈ (2 pi a_p M_p ) / ( M_star * 2 pi ( a_p^3 / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 ) )

Simplify:

v ≈ ( a_p M_p ) / ( M_star ) * ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a_p^(3/2 )

= ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/2 ) ) ) * sqrt( G ) / a_p^(1/2 )

So,

v = K ≈ ( M_p ) * sqrt( G / ( M_star a_p ) ) )

So, K is proportional to M_p / sqrt( a_p )

Wait, that's different from earlier.

So, K ∝ M_p / sqrt( a_p )

But since K1/K2 = 0.75, and M_p1 =7, M_p2=5,

(7 / sqrt(a1 )) / (5 / sqrt(a2 )) ) = 0.75

→ (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75

→ sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (0.75 * 5) /7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357

→ a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.2868 → a1 = a2 * 3.48 ?

Wait, no: sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.5357 → a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 → a2/a1 ≈ 0.2868 → a1 = a2 /0.2868 → a1 ≈ 3.48 a2.

So, a1 is much larger than a2, which contradicts our earlier finding. Hmm, but this approach might be correct.

Wait, this suggests that a1 is larger than a2, which would make Planet1 farther away. Then, T1 would be lower than T2.

Wait, let's recompute.

If a1 ≈3.48 a2. So, a1 is larger than a2.

Then, T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

So,

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = sqrt( a2 /a1 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( a2 / (3.48 a2 ) ) = 1 / sqrt(3.48 ) ≈ 1/1.866 ≈ 0.5357.

So T1 is about 0.5357 times T2.

Hmm, that gives a ratio of ~0.5357, which is about 0.53, matching option C.

But earlier, using the other approach, I got T1/T2 ≈1.866, which isn't an option.

Wait, but this is conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, the confusion arises from whether the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to M_p/(sqrt(a_p)) or M_p * sqrt(a_p).

In this latest approach, I get K ∝ M_p / sqrt( a_p )

So, K1/K2 = (M_p1 / sqrt(a1 )) / (M_p2 / sqrt(a2 )) ) = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which leads to the ratio I found.

But what's the correct proportionality?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for RV semi-amplitude.

The correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (a_p (1-e²)^(3/2) )^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/(c)) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps confusion arises from the exact formula. But for a circular orbit (e=0), the formula simplifies.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct relation is:

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) c ) )

But in any case, perhaps it's easier to assume that K is proportional to (M_p ) * ( sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) a_p^(1/3) )

Because from the formula, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( ( M_star^(2/3) a_p^(1/3) ) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / ( M_p2 ) ) * ( a2^(1/3 ) / a1^(1/3 ) )

So,

K1/K2 = (7/5) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

→ (a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5)/7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357

→ a2/a1 = (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153

So,

a2 = 0.153 a1 → a1 ≈6.53 a2.

Wait, that would mean Planet1 is much farther away than Planet2.

So, then, equilibrium temperatures would be:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

= sqrt( 1 /6.53 ) → sqrt( 0.153 ) ≈ 0.391.

Which is even lower than option C (~0.53). So that can't be.

This is getting confusing. Perhaps I should look up the formula for K.

Upon checking, the correct RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) ) ) )^(1/1) * (1/(2 pi c ))^(1) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula from the radial velocity method.

The formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ( (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) ) ) ]^(1/1) * (1/(2 pi c )) * ( 1 / ( (P * (1 year in seconds) )^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to the formula that relates K, P, and a.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = [ ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * ( a_p (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) )^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1/c) * (1/( sqrt(1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

But again, this might not be the simplest approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct proportionality is K ∝ ( M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) a_p^(1/3) ) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2^(1/3) / a1^(1/3) )

Which gives,

K1/K2 = (7/5) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5 )/7 = 3.75 /7 ≈ 0.5357

→ a2/a1 = (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153 → a1 ≈6.53 a2.

So, a1 is about 6.53 times larger than a2.

Thus, Planet1 is much farther from the star than Planet2.

So, equilibrium temperature:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/6.53 ) ≈ 0.391.

Which is about 0.39, close to option C (0.53), but not exactly.

Wait, but perhaps the star's radius isn't as important as I thought.

Wait, in the equilibrium temperature formula, the star's radius R_star is in the numerator. So, if R_star is larger, then T_eq increases.

The star has R = 1.2 R_sun, and T_eff = 6300 K.

So, the star is larger than the Sun, which would make planets at the same distance have higher equilibrium temperatures.

But in this case, the a1 is much larger than a2, so even though R is larger, the a term dominates.

Wait, let me compute T1 and T2 numerically.

Given:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

We have:

T_star = 6300 K

R_star = 1.2 R_sun.

But since we're taking the ratio, the actual value of R_star cancels, but let's think in terms of the ratio.

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From earlier, a2/a1 ≈ 0.153, so T1/T2 ≈ sqrt(0.153) ≈ 0.391.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is that the ratio is about 0.53, which is option C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I swapped K1 and K2.

In the question, Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å.

So, K1 = 0.03 Å shift → velocity semi-amplitude of about 1428.57 m/s.

K2 = 0.04 → 1904.76 m/s.

So, K2 > K1 → Planet2 causes larger Doppler shift.

Which would imply that Planet2 is more massive or closer.

Wait, but Planet1 is more massive (7 Earth) than Planet2 (5 Earth).

So, with higher K, Planet2's velocity is higher.

Which suggests that Planet2 is either more massive, closer, or both.

But Planet1 is more massive but has a lower K.

So, K is higher for Planet2 despite lower mass. So, perhaps Planet2 is closer to the star.

In that case, a2 is smaller than a1.

Which would make T2 higher than T1.

Wait, but in our previous approach, when a1 is larger than a2 (Planet1 farther), T1 is lower, T2 higher. But earlier calculations gave a ratio of ~0.53, which would be T1/T2=0.53, so T2 is about twice as hot as T1.

But that would imply the ratio is ~0.53, which is option C.

But in the options, option C is 0.53, which would be T1/T2=0.53, so T2 is about 1.89 times T1.

But in our latest approach, I thought a1 is 6.53 a2, leading to T1/T2=0.39.

But that's not matching.

Hmm, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I should think differently.

Another approach: let's compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures directly.

The equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(a)).

So, ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2.

We need to find a1 and a2.

But from RV, we can relate a and K.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) a_p^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi c )) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) ) )

But without P, perhaps we can relate a1 and a2 using K and the mass ratio.

But I think I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps I should find the ratio of a1 to a2.

From the earlier approach where K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a_p ), we have:

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

→ sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (0.75 *5 )/7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357 → a2/a1 ≈ 0.2868 → a1 = a2 /0.2868 ≈ 3.48 a2.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Thus, a1 > a2 → Planet1 is farther from the star.

Thus, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.48 ) ≈ 0.5357.

So, approximately 0.5357, which is about 0.53, matching option C.

So the correct ratio is T1/T2 ≈ 0.53, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between the two planets is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-Amplitudes to Orbital Distances
The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a_p}}
\]

For Planet1 and Planet2, the RV semi-amplitudes are given as \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\). The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Using the proportionality \(K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a_p}}\), we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting the known values (\(M_{p1} = 7\), \(M_{p2} = 5\)):

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75 \cdot 5}{7} = \frac{3.75}{7} \approx 0.5357
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.2868
\]

Thus:

\[
a_1 \approx 3.48 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substitute \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.2868\):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.2868} \approx 0.5357
\]

### Step 3: Matching to the Options
The calculated ratio \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.5357\) is closest to option **C (~0.53)**.

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question here about planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says there are two planets detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits. 

The transit method probably gives the size of the planet (because transit depth is related to planet size and star radius), and RV gives the mass. But the question is about equilibrium temperatures. 

Wait, equilibrium temperature—oh right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, considering the star's radiation and its own emission. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), I think. Or wait, maybe it's ( (L / (16 * pi * sigma * a^2 )) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity.

Wait, Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. So substituting that into the equilibrium temperature formula, T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4).

But wait, another approach. The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Since the planets are detected via RV and transit, we can maybe find their distances from the star? Hmm, but the question doesn't give their orbital periods or distances directly. Wait, maybe the RV method gives the mass and the orbit's period, but the question doesn't provide those numbers.

Wait, but the problem gives the Doppler shifts from each planet on the [OI] line. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's motion caused by the planet's orbit. The maximum Doppler shift is related to the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The shift is given in terms of wavelength change.

Wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately v/c. But the problem gives the shift in angstroms. Oh, wait, the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å.

So the velocity semi-amplitude K can be calculated from the Doppler shift. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So v = c * (Δλ/λ).

Where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s or 3e8 m/s. But let me think in terms of angstroms. The wavelength λ is 6300 Å, and the change Δλ is 0.03 Å for Planet1, 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So K1 for Planet1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, K2 is (0.04 / 6300) * c. 

Wait, but the actual calculation: Let me compute K1. 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-3 / 6.3e3 = ~4.76e-7. Multiply by c (3e5 km/s) → 4.76e-7 * 3e5 = approx 0.1429 km/s = 142.9 m/s. Similarly, Planet2's K is 0.04 /6300 *3e5 km/s. 0.04/6300 is ~6.349e-6, times 3e5 gives about 1.905 km/s → 1905 m/s? Wait, wait, no, wait: 0.04/6300 is 4e-5 /6.3e3 → wait, let me recompute.

Wait, 0.03 /6300 = 0.03 /6300 = 1/210000 ≈ 4.76e-6. So 4.76e-6 * c (3e5 km/s) → 4.76e-6 * 3e5 = 1.428 km/s. Similarly, 0.04 /6300 is 4e-5 /6300? Wait no, 0.04 /6300 is (4e-2)/(6.3e3) = (4e-2)/(6.3e3) = (4/(6.3e5)) ) → 4 /630000 ≈ 6.349e-6. So K2 is 6.349e-6 *3e5 km/s = 6.349e-6 *3e5 = approx 1.9048 km/s.

Wait, but why are these velocities different? Because each planet has a different mass and semi-major axis. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the formula for K is K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) )? No, wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) )

But maybe a better approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps we can relate the K values to the planet masses and their distances. Alternatively, since the star's mass is given, and the planets' masses are known, maybe we can find the ratio of their orbital distances a1 and a2.

Wait, but maybe I can relate the velocities from RV to the orbital distance. Because, from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by:

P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G(M_star + M_planet)) )

Assuming M_planet << M_star, which is likely, as M_planet is in Earth masses (like 7 Earth masses) and M_star is 1.5 solar masses (so much larger), so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star )

But for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Hmm, but perhaps another approach is to note that the Doppler semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ), because from Kepler's law, a^3 ∝ (M_star) P^2 / (4 pi^2), so a^(1/3) ∝ (M_star^(1/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) / ( (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) )

But maybe that's getting complicated. Let me think: since both planets are around the same star, and the question asks about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, which depends on the ratio of (R_star / a)^2, since T_eq is proportional to (L/(a^2))^(1/4), and L = sigma T_star^4 4 pi R_star^2. So L is proportional to R_star^2 T_star^4.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

Because L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. The flux at distance a is L/(4 pi a^2) = sigma T_eq^4.

So,

sigma T_eq^4 = (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 )/(4 pi a^2 )

Cancel 4 pi and sigma:

T_eq^4 = ( R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / a^2

Take square root both sides:

T_eq^2 = ( R_star T_star^2 ) / a

Take square root again:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-derive.

Flux from star at planet's distance: L/(4 pi a^2) = [4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ] / (4 pi a^2 ) = sigma T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2 )

Set equal to sigma T_eq^4:

sigma T_eq^4 = sigma T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2 )

Cancel sigma:

T_eq^4 = T_star^4 (R_star^2 / a^2 )

Take fourth root:

T_eq = T_star * (R_star / a )^(1/2 )

Ah, so T_eq is T_star multiplied by sqrt( R_star / a ).

So, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of (R_star / a). So for the ratio T1/T2, it's sqrt( (R1 a2)/(R2 a1) ) ), but wait, wait. Let me compute T1 and T2:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, no, let me correct that. 

Wait, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star / a ), so for each planet, T1 and T2 are proportional to sqrt( R_star / a1 ) and sqrt( R_star / a2 ), respectively. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( ( R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( a2 ) / sqrt( a1 )

But wait, that's the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures. So to find T1/T2, it's sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets, we can relate them through the RV semi-amplitudes K.

Because, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) a^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (something))

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3 )

Hmm, but since both planets are orbiting the same star, and sin i is the same (assuming same inclination; but since transit method is used, i ≈ 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1), perhaps we can relate K1 and K2 to the cube of (M_p / a^(1/2) )

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) )) ), because from Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_star P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

Wait, let me think: the RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

But M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But I also know from Kepler's third law that P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G M_star )

So, P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 )

Substituting P into the K expression:

K ≈ [ ( G * [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 ) ) / (2 pi c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Simplify step by step.

Let me compute the exponent:

Inside the first part of K's expression:

G * [ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/2 ) 

= G * (4 pi^2 a^3 )^(1/2) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

= G^(1) * (4 pi^2 )^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) )

= (4 pi^2 )^(1/2) * G^(1 - 1/2) a^(3/2) ) / M_star^(1/2 )

= (2 pi ) * G^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / M_star^(1/2 )

Now, divide by 2 pi c^3:

So, (2 pi G^(1/2) a^(3/2 )) / M_star^(1/2 ) ) / (2 pi c^3 )

= ( G^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c^3 )

Now, take the cube root:

[ ( G^(1/2) a^(3/2) ) / ( M_star^(1/2) c^3 ) ]^(1/3 )

= G^(1/(6)) a^(1/2) ) / ( M_star^(1/6) c )

Now, the entire K expression is this multiplied by ( M_p ) / M_star^(2/3 )

So,

K ≈ [ G^(1/6) a^(1/2) / ( M_star^(1/6) c ) ) ] * ( M_p ) / M_star^(2/3 )

Combine the M_star terms:

M_star^(1/6) * M_star^(2/3) = M_star^( (1/6)+(4/6) ) = M_star^(5/6 )

Wait, let me calculate exponents:

M_star in denominator is ( M_star^(1/6) ) * ( M_star^(2/3) ) = M_star^(1/6 + 4/6 ) = M_star^(5/6 )

So,

K ≈ [ G^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_p ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

So,

K = [ ( G^(1/6) a^(1/2) M_p ) ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

We can write this as:

K = ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(5/6) c ) ) * ( G^(1/6) a^(1/2) )

Alternatively, rearranged:

K ∝ ( M_p ) * a^(1/2 ) / M_star^(5/6 )

But since M_p varies between the two planets, and a is their semi-major axes, perhaps we can find the ratio K1/K2 in terms of M_p1, M_p2, a1, a2.

Wait, let me write the equation for each planet.

K1 = ( G^(1/6) a1^(1/2) M_p1 ) / ( M_star^(5/6) c )

Similarly,

K2 = ( G^(1/6) a2^(1/2) M_p2 ) / ( M_star^(5/6) c )

Dividing K1 by K2,

K1/K2 = [ (a1^(1/2) M_p1 ) ] / [ (a2^(1/2) M_p2 ) ]

= sqrt( a1/a2 ) * ( M_p1 / M_p2 )

But let's compute K1 and K2 from the given data.

We have K1 corresponding to Planet1's Doppler shift: 0.03 Å.

K2 is 0.04 Å.

So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75

So,

0.75 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7 /5 )

Because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses.

So,

0.75 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7/5 )

Let's solve for sqrt(a1/a2):

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 0.75 * (5/7 ) = (3/4) * (5/7 ) = (15/28 ) ≈ 0.5357

So,

sqrt(a1/a2 ) ≈ 0.5357 → square both sides,

a1/a2 ≈ (15/28 )^2 ≈ (225)/(784) ≈ 0.2867

So, a1 ≈ 0.2867 a2

Alternatively, a2 = a1 / 0.2867 ≈ 3.48 a1

Wait, but wait, that's a1/a2 ratio. So,

a1 = 0.2867 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.2867 ≈ 3.48 a1

Wait, but this is a1/a2 = (15/28 )^2.

Wait, let me compute 15/28:

15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357, so square is ~ 0.2868.

So, a1 is about 0.2868 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but which planet is closer? Since a1 is smaller, Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2.

But how does this relate to their equilibrium temperatures?

Earlier, we found that T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

So, for the ratio T1/T2:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the R_star cancels.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have a1/a2 ≈ 0.2868 → a2/a1 ≈ 3.48.

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt(3.48) ≈ 1.866.

Wait, but that's a problem because the options don't have such a high ratio.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recheck:

Wait, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, a2 is larger than a1, so the ratio is greater than 1. So Planet1 is hotter.

Hmm, but the options are: A) ~ 0.98; B) ~1.30; C) ~0.53; D) ~1.05. So option B is around 1.3, which is close to our preliminary calculation of ~1.86. Wait, that's not matching. So perhaps I messed up somewhere.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the K ratio.

Wait, let me recompute the K1/K2 ratio.

K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å.

So K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75

Earlier, I had:

K1/K2 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7/5 )

So,

0.75 = sqrt( a1/a2 ) * (7/5 )

Wait, 7/5 is 1.4.

So,

sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357

Which gives a1/a2 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.2868.

So a1 is about 28.68% of a2, meaning a2 is about 3.48 times a1.

Thus, a2 is larger than a1, so a1 < a2.

So, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/(a1/a2) ) = sqrt(1/0.2868 ) ≈ sqrt(3.48) ≈ 1.866.

But the options don't have 1.8, so something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I confused which K corresponds to which planet. Let me read the question again.

"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å."

Ah, so K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04.

So K1=0.03, K2=0.04.

So K1/K2 = 3/4.

So earlier approach was correct.

Then, in our calculation, T1 is hotter than T2 by a factor of ~1.866.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the inverse when computing a1/a2.

Wait, the ratio K1/K2 is 0.75.

From earlier:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, no, earlier I said K1/K2 = sqrt(a1/a2) * (M_p1/M_p2 )

Wait, let me re-express.

Wait, K1 = [ G^(1/6) a1^(1/2) M_p1 ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

K2 = [ G^(1/6) a2^(1/2) M_p2 ] / [ M_star^(5/6) c ]

So, K1/K2 = [ a1^(1/2) M_p1 ] / [ a2^(1/2) M_p2 ]

= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

Ah, yes. So K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a1/a2 )

Given K1=0.03, K2=0.04 → K1/K2=3/4=0.75

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt(a1/a2 )

→ sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 0.75 * (5/7 )

0.75 is 3/4, so 3/4 *5/7 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

So sqrt(a1/a2) ≈ 0.5357 → a1/a2 = (15/28)^2 ≈ 225/784 ≈ 0.2868.

Thus, a1 = 0.2868 a2.

So, a2 is larger than a1. So the planet with K2 (Planet2) is farther from the star.

Thus, when considering equilibrium temperature, the closer planet will be hotter.

So, T1 is closer, so T1 > T2.

The ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 1/ sqrt( a1/a2 ) = 1/ sqrt(0.2868) ≈ 1/0.5357 ≈ 1.866.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are: 

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

Hmm, none near 1.8. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I confused the Doppler shift with velocity. Let me think again about how the Doppler shift relates to velocity.

The Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c.

So, for a given velocity v, delta_lambda = v * lambda / c.

So, for a given K (semi-amplitude of velocity), the Doppler shift is (v * lambda ) / c.

Wait, but the question says the shift is up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So, the semi-amplitude of velocity K1 is:

K1 = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c

So,

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * c

Wait, wait, but this is for the observed Doppler shift.

Wait, but the formula for K is (v) = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute K1 and K2 correctly because I might have had a mistake in earlier steps.

So, K1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Wait, let me compute K1 and K2 in m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So,

K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s

= (0.03 /6300 ) * 3e8 m/s

0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = (3/6300) * 1e-1 → 0.00047619 → So 0.00047619 *3e8 = 1.42857e5 m/s? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait a second, 0.03 angstrom is 0.03e-10 meters. 6300 angstrom is 6300e-10 meters.

So,

K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) * 3e8 m/s

= (0.03/6300) * 3e8 m/s

0.03 /6300 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = (3 / 6300 ) * 1e-5 → 4.7619e-6 → 4.7619e-6 * 3e8 = 1.42857e3 m/s = ~1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, K2 = (0.04e-10 m /6300e-10 m ) *3e8 m/s

0.04/6300 = 4e-2 /6.3e3 = 4/(630000) = ~6.3492e-6.

Multiply by 3e8 → 6.3492e-6 *3e8 = 1.90476e3 m/s ≈ 1905 m/s.

Wait, so K1 is about 1428.57 m/s, K2 is 1904.76 m/s.

So, the ratio K1/K2 = 1428.57 / 1904.76 ≈ 0.75.

Earlier, this ratio came out 0.75, which is correct.

So, using K1=1428.57 m/s and K2=1904.76 m/s, the ratio is 0.75.

So, same as before.

So, the earlier calculations about a1 and a2 are correct.

So, T1/T2 is ~1.866.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equilibrium temperature formula.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we used:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

But perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 1/2, so T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

But in any case, the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) * sqrt( (1- albedo_Planet1)/(1- albedo_Planet2) )

But the question states that both planets have the same albedo. So, the albedo term cancels out.

Wait, then the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), as before.

So, the same conclusion holds.

So, why is the calculated ratio not among the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for K. Let's re-examine the RV semi-amplitude formula.

The correct formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) * (1 year ) ) ) ]^(1/ something )

Wait, perhaps better to refer to the standard RV semi-amplitude formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

But P is the orbital period.

But another approach is to express K in terms of the orbital velocity v.

The orbital velocity of the star around the barycenter is v = K.

The star's velocity is given by v = (2 pi a ) / P, where a is the star's orbit radius (a = a_p * (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) ), but since M_p << M_star, a ≈ a_p * ( M_p / M_star ), where a_p is the planet's semi-major axis.

So, v ≈ (2 pi a_p M_p )/( M_star P )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a_p^3 )/( G M_star )

So,

P = 2 pi (a_p^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into the expression for v:

v ≈ (2 pi a_p M_p ) / ( M_star * 2 pi ( a_p^3 / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 ) )

Simplify:

v ≈ ( a_p M_p ) / ( M_star ) * ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a_p^(3/2 )

= ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/2 ) ) ) * sqrt( G ) / a_p^(1/2 )

So,

v = K ≈ ( M_p ) * sqrt( G / ( M_star a_p ) ) )

So, K is proportional to M_p / sqrt( a_p )

Wait, that's different from earlier.

So, K ∝ M_p / sqrt( a_p )

But since K1/K2 = 0.75, and M_p1 =7, M_p2=5,

(7 / sqrt(a1 )) / (5 / sqrt(a2 )) ) = 0.75

→ (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75

→ sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (0.75 * 5) /7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357

→ a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.2868 → a1 = a2 * 3.48 ?

Wait, no: sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.5357 → a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 → a2/a1 ≈ 0.2868 → a1 = a2 /0.2868 → a1 ≈ 3.48 a2.

So, a1 is much larger than a2, which contradicts our earlier finding. Hmm, but this approach might be correct.

Wait, this suggests that a1 is larger than a2, which would make Planet1 farther away. Then, T1 would be lower than T2.

Wait, let's recompute.

If a1 ≈3.48 a2. So, a1 is larger than a2.

Then, T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

So,

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = sqrt( a2 /a1 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( a2 / (3.48 a2 ) ) = 1 / sqrt(3.48 ) ≈ 1/1.866 ≈ 0.5357.

So T1 is about 0.5357 times T2.

Hmm, that gives a ratio of ~0.5357, which is about 0.53, matching option C.

But earlier, using the other approach, I got T1/T2 ≈1.866, which isn't an option.

Wait, but this is conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, the confusion arises from whether the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to M_p/(sqrt(a_p)) or M_p * sqrt(a_p).

In this latest approach, I get K ∝ M_p / sqrt( a_p )

So, K1/K2 = (M_p1 / sqrt(a1 )) / (M_p2 / sqrt(a2 )) ) = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which leads to the ratio I found.

But what's the correct proportionality?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for RV semi-amplitude.

The correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (a_p (1-e²)^(3/2) )^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/(c)) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps confusion arises from the exact formula. But for a circular orbit (e=0), the formula simplifies.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct relation is:

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) c ) )

But in any case, perhaps it's easier to assume that K is proportional to (M_p ) * ( sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) a_p^(1/3) )

Because from the formula, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( ( M_star^(2/3) a_p^(1/3) ) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / ( M_p2 ) ) * ( a2^(1/3 ) / a1^(1/3 ) )

So,

K1/K2 = (7/5) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

→ (a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5)/7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357

→ a2/a1 = (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153

So,

a2 = 0.153 a1 → a1 ≈6.53 a2.

Wait, that would mean Planet1 is much farther away than Planet2.

So, then, equilibrium temperatures would be:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

= sqrt( 1 /6.53 ) → sqrt( 0.153 ) ≈ 0.391.

Which is even lower than option C (~0.53). So that can't be.

This is getting confusing. Perhaps I should look up the formula for K.

Upon checking, the correct RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) ) ) )^(1/1) * (1/(2 pi c ))^(1) * (1/( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula from the radial velocity method.

The formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ( (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) ) ) ]^(1/1) * (1/(2 pi c )) * ( 1 / ( (P * (1 year in seconds) )^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to the formula that relates K, P, and a.

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = [ ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * ( a_p (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) )^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1/c) * (1/( sqrt(1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

But again, this might not be the simplest approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct proportionality is K ∝ ( M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) a_p^(1/3) ) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2^(1/3) / a1^(1/3) )

Which gives,

K1/K2 = (7/5) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

So,

( a2/a1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75 *5 )/7 = 3.75 /7 ≈ 0.5357

→ a2/a1 = (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153 → a1 ≈6.53 a2.

So, a1 is about 6.53 times larger than a2.

Thus, Planet1 is much farther from the star than Planet2.

So, equilibrium temperature:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 ) = sqrt(1/6.53 ) ≈ 0.391.

Which is about 0.39, close to option C (0.53), but not exactly.

Wait, but perhaps the star's radius isn't as important as I thought.

Wait, in the equilibrium temperature formula, the star's radius R_star is in the numerator. So, if R_star is larger, then T_eq increases.

The star has R = 1.2 R_sun, and T_eff = 6300 K.

So, the star is larger than the Sun, which would make planets at the same distance have higher equilibrium temperatures.

But in this case, the a1 is much larger than a2, so even though R is larger, the a term dominates.

Wait, let me compute T1 and T2 numerically.

Given:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a )

We have:

T_star = 6300 K

R_star = 1.2 R_sun.

But since we're taking the ratio, the actual value of R_star cancels, but let's think in terms of the ratio.

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From earlier, a2/a1 ≈ 0.153, so T1/T2 ≈ sqrt(0.153) ≈ 0.391.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is that the ratio is about 0.53, which is option C.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I swapped K1 and K2.

In the question, Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å.

So, K1 = 0.03 Å shift → velocity semi-amplitude of about 1428.57 m/s.

K2 = 0.04 → 1904.76 m/s.

So, K2 > K1 → Planet2 causes larger Doppler shift.

Which would imply that Planet2 is more massive or closer.

Wait, but Planet1 is more massive (7 Earth) than Planet2 (5 Earth).

So, with higher K, Planet2's velocity is higher.

Which suggests that Planet2 is either more massive, closer, or both.

But Planet1 is more massive but has a lower K.

So, K is higher for Planet2 despite lower mass. So, perhaps Planet2 is closer to the star.

In that case, a2 is smaller than a1.

Which would make T2 higher than T1.

Wait, but in our previous approach, when a1 is larger than a2 (Planet1 farther), T1 is lower, T2 higher. But earlier calculations gave a ratio of ~0.53, which would be T1/T2=0.53, so T2 is about twice as hot as T1.

But that would imply the ratio is ~0.53, which is option C.

But in the options, option C is 0.53, which would be T1/T2=0.53, so T2 is about 1.89 times T1.

But in our latest approach, I thought a1 is 6.53 a2, leading to T1/T2=0.39.

But that's not matching.

Hmm, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I should think differently.

Another approach: let's compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures directly.

The equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(a)).

So, ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2.

We need to find a1 and a2.

But from RV, we can relate a and K.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) a_p^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi c )) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) ) )

But without P, perhaps we can relate a1 and a2 using K and the mass ratio.

But I think I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps I should find the ratio of a1 to a2.

From the earlier approach where K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a_p ), we have:

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

→ sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (0.75 *5 )/7 = 3.75/7 ≈ 0.5357 → a2/a1 ≈ 0.2868 → a1 = a2 /0.2868 ≈ 3.48 a2.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Thus, a1 > a2 → Planet1 is farther from the star.

Thus, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a1 )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a2 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.48 ) ≈ 0.5357.

So, approximately 0.5357, which is about 0.53, matching option C.

So the correct ratio is T1/T2 ≈ 0.53, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between the two planets is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity (RV) Semi-Amplitudes to Orbital Distances
The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a_p}}
\]

For Planet1 and Planet2, the RV semi-amplitudes are given as \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\). The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Using the proportionality \(K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a_p}}\), we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting the known values (\(M_{p1} = 7\), \(M_{p2} = 5\)):

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75 \cdot 5}{7} = \frac{3.75}{7} \approx 0.5357
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.2868
\]

Thus:

\[
a_1 \approx 3.48 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substitute \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.2868\):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.2868} \approx 0.5357
\]

### Step 3: Matching to the Options
The calculated ratio \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.5357\) is closest to option **C (~0.53)**.

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.
