Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to think it through. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has something to do with magnetic fields and electron spins. Oh right, the Zeeman effect maybe? Or wait, no, paramagnetism is about the interaction of a magnetic field with the spin of electrons.

The problem says the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz, which I think is the z-axis. And B is 1 Tesla. Small m values, which refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, orbital? But paramagnetism is usually spin-related, right. Oh, maybe it's the spin magnetic quantum number. Hmm, I might be mixing terms here. Wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can be -1, 0, +1 for a p orbital, but for an electron, the spin magnetic quantum number is ±1/2. Hmm, but the question says small values of m. So perhaps m is small, like m=0 or ±1, which are small in magnitude.

The problem is to compare ⟨H⟩, which I think is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition energy is given with a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. That's the Balmer series, I think. The hydrogen atom's energy levels. So ΔE would be the energy difference between two levels, perhaps n=2 and n=1, but wait, no, the Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at n=2. So for example, n=3 to n=2 gives λ=0.656 nm, but wait the given λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm. Oh right, that's the n=4 to n=2 transition. Or wait, 486 nm is the Balmer beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. So the transition energy ΔE would be equal to hc/λ. Right, because ΔE = hc/λ.

So first, I need to calculate ΔE. Let's see, h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters, since 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm, which is 486.1e-9 m, but wait, 0.4861e-6 m is 486.1e-9 m. So λ = 486.1e-9 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m). Let's compute this. Let's see, numerator is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 486.1e-9 meters. So 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = let's compute 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7. That's approximately (1.9878 /4.861) * 1e-25+7 = (approx 0.408) * 1e-18 = 4.08e-19 J. So about 4.08e-19 Joules.

Now, what about the paramagnetic coupling term? That's the Hamiltonian term due to the magnetic interaction. The paramagnetic term is given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (e/(2m)) * s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio. Wait, but more accurately, the magnetic dipole moment for an electron's spin is μ = -g_s * μ_B * m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, which is ±1/2. But wait, the problem refers to "paramagnetic coupling term", which is the interaction between the magnetic dipole moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. So the Hamiltonian would be H = -μ·B. So H = -μ_z B, since B is along z-axis.

Wait, but the problem says 'paramagnetic coupling term'. Paramagnetism arises from the spin of electrons. So the coupling term is probably the Zeeman term. So the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field is H = -μ · B, and μ for spin is μ = γ s, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Alternatively, the spin magnetic moment μ_s is given by μ_s = g_s (eħ)/(2m_e) S, where S is the spin operator. But perhaps it's easier to express it in terms of the Bohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e). So μ = g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is ±1/2.

Now, the energy from this interaction is H = -μ·B. So for B along z, H = -μ_z B = -g μ_B m_s B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be -g μ_B m_s B. But wait, the problem mentions orbital magnetic quantum number m. Or wait, maybe m refers to the spin magnetic quantum number? Because orbital would be for the orbital angular momentum, but paramagnetism involves spin.

Wait, the problem states: "small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, not m. Or wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, ranging from -l to +l, but in this case, m is small, like m=0, ±1, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but the m for orbital is m_l, which can be from -l to +l. So if m is small, perhaps m=0? But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the problem is considering that the paramagnetic term comes from the spin, so m would be the spin magnetic quantum number, which is ±1/2. But the problem says m is small, so maybe m=0? Or perhaps it's m being orbital, but the situation is that the paramagnetic term is due to spin, so orbital m may not be directly involved. Hmm, I'm a bit tangled up here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the order of magnitude, so maybe I can proceed without exact numbers but by estimating the energies.

So, the paramagnetic term's energy is the expectation value of H, which is proportional to m_s B. Let me think, m_s is ±1/2 for electrons. So the magnitude would be (1/2) * something. So the expectation value would be something like (g μ_B) * (1/2) * B.

What's μ_B? The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So let's compute that. So H would be approximately g * μ_B * (1/2) * B. The gyromagnetic ratio g for the electron is about 2 (the spin g-factor is approximately 2).

So putting it together: H ≈ 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 0.5 * 1 T. Let's compute that. 2 * 0.5 is 1, so 9.274e-24 J. So ⟨H⟩ is about 9.274e-24 J.

But wait, the transition energy ΔE we calculated earlier was about 4.08e-19 J. So how does 9.27e-24 compare to 4.08e-19? Let's see, 9.27e-24 is about four orders of magnitude smaller than 4e-19. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is the energy due to the magnetic field interacting with the electron's spin. So the energy splitting would be around 9e-24 J for each state, but the transition energy is about 4e-19 J. So 9e-24 is much smaller than 4e-19. So the paramagnetic term is << ΔE.

But wait, another thought: in atoms, the energy levels are split by the Zeeman effect when a magnetic field is applied. The energy shift is proportional to m_s B. So for example, if the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, and the magnetic field is B, the shift would be something like m (e/(2m)) * B. Wait, but that's the orbital Zeeman effect. For the spin part, it's the paramagnetic term. So if the problem is considering the orbital contribution, then m would be the orbital m (m_l), but that's usually for the orbital Zeeman effect. Hmm, but the question specifically says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which is the spin contribution. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin part, which is much smaller.

So if ⟨H⟩ is about 9e-24 J and ΔE is 4e-19 J, then ⟨H⟩ is much smaller. So the order is ⟨H⟩ << ΔE. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, another thing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck.

H for the spin term is H = -μ·B. μ = g μ_B m_s. So H = -g μ_B m_s B. So the expectation value is -g μ_B m_s B. For m_s = 1/2, it's - (2)(9.27e-24 J/T)(1/2)(1 T) = -9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but the problem says 'small values of m'. If m is the spin magnetic quantum number, m can be ±1/2, which are small numbers. So that's consistent. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 9e-24 J, which is way smaller than ΔE of 4e-19 J. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, so the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm (486.1 nm), corresponding to the Balmer series transition in hydrogen. The energy difference is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The magnetic moment is given by \( \mu = g \mu_B m_s \), where \( g \) is the gyromagnetic ratio (approximately 2 for electrons), \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( m_s = \pm 1/2 \) is the spin magnetic quantum number.  
   The energy is:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = -\mu \cdot B = -g \mu_B m_s B.
   \]  
   Substituting \( g = 2 \), \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \), \( m_s = 1/2 \), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx -(2)(9.274 \times 10^{-24})(0.5)(1) \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \) is approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Therefore, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

**Conclusion**: The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.
