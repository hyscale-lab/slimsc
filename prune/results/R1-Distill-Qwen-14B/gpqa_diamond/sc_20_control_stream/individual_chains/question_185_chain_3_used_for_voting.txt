Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon multiplied by the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the Pauli vector, right? So each component of sigma are the Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So when we take the dot product of sigma and n, it's like sigma · n = n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. Then the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon times that sum.

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix, that's what we're looking for. Right, eigenvalues satisfy the equation H |psi> = E |psi>, where E is the eigenvalue.

But wait, I think I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator S is (hbar/2) sigma. Oh wait, so maybe the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues related to hbar/2. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is given in terms of sigma, so let me think about how that works.

The Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix because sigma matrices are 2x2. So H is a 2x2 matrix given by epsilon times the sum of sigma_i n_i.

Wait, but what's the general form of the eigenvalues for such a matrix? Oh right, for a 2x2 matrix like this, the eigenvalues can be found by taking the trace and determinant, or perhaps more straightforwardly, since the Pauli matrices have known properties.

Wait, another approach: The dot product sigma · n is a vector operator. The eigenvalues of such an operator would be the magnitude multiplied by the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix in that direction. Since n is a unit vector, the direction doesn't affect the magnitude, just the orientation.

Wait, each Pauli matrix (sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when you take sigma · n, which is a linear combination of these, what are the eigenvalues?

Wait, I think that the eigenvalues of sigma · n would be the sum of the eigenvalues of each component multiplied by their respective coefficients. But no, because it's a sum of matrices scaled by n_i.

Wait, no. Let me think. The operator sigma · n is a spin component operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of sigma · n are +1 and -1 because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and a linear combination's eigenvalues would be the same in magnitude because the Pauli matrices are orthogonal in a sense.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose H = epsilon * sigma · n. The eigenvalue equation is H |psi> = E |psi>. So (epsilon (sigma · n)) |psi> = E |psi>. So sigma · n |psi> = (E/epsilon) |psi>.

So the eigenvalues of sigma · n are E/(epsilon) for each eigenvalue E of H.

But sigma · n is a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1. Because, for any direction n, the matrix sigma · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because, for example, for sigma_z, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. If you rotate the coordinate system so that n is along a different axis, the eigenvalues don't change because it's just a rotation of the spin state.

So the eigenvalues of sigma · n are ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H = epsilon sigma · n would be epsilon times ±1, so E = ±epsilon.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Let me make sure. Because sigma · n is a unit vector direction, the eigenvalues are ±1. So when you multiply by epsilon, the eigenvalues are ±epsilon. So the eigenvalues of H are +epsilon and -epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B is "+epsilon, -epsilon". So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait another moment. I think I might have made a mistake. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but what's the scaling factor? Because sigma matrices are multiplied by n_i, but n is a unit vector, so each coefficient is n_i, which is less than or equal to 1. Wait, but sigma · n is a Hermitian operator, so its eigenvalues are real. For any unit vector n, sigma · n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1.

Because, for example, if n is along z, sigma_z has eigenvalues ±1. If n is along x, sigma_x has eigenvalues ±1. So regardless of the direction, the eigenvalues are ±1. So H would have eigenvalues ±epsilon.

So the correct eigenvalues are +epsilon and -epsilon. Looking back at the options, option B is "+epsilon, -epsilon". So the answer is B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

The Pauli spin matrices (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) are 2x2 Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \). The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \) represents the spin component in the direction of \( \vec{n} \). Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), as the direction of \( \vec{n} \) does not change the magnitude of the eigenvalues.

The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is proportional to \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), which are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

From the given options:
- Option A (\( \pm 1 \)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not 1.
- Option B (\( \pm \varepsilon \)) is correct, as shown above.
- Option C (\( \pm \varepsilon \hbar / 2 \)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are \( \pm 1 \), not \( \pm \hbar / 2 \).
- Option D (\( \pm \hbar / 2 \)) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Answer: B
