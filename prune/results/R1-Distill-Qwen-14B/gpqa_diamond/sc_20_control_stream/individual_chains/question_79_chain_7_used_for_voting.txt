Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR spectra of the product after a reaction. Alright, let's break it down.

So, Compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used base, often used in the Corey-Fuchs reaction or maybe something else. Oh wait, no, more likely, it's used in the elimination reactions, maybe as a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps it's deprotonating something in Compound X, leading to an elimination or a rearrangement.

The product's NMR data is given. So the reaction is probably an elimination, like forming a double bond or modifying an existing one. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the peak. Maybe an aromatic ring or an electronegative atom. Wait, but in what context?
- 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, but a different shift. Could be another methyl group, maybe on a benzene ring as a substituent. Styryl groups have methyl substituents sometimes.
The aromatic region:
- 6.75 (1H, d): Doublet, so coupling with one neighboring proton.
- 7.08 (2H, d): Doublet, two protons. Maybe a pair of H's in a para-substituted benzene or something similar.
- 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet, maybe another H in a substituted ring.
- 7.71 (2H, d): Two H's, doublet, perhaps part of a para-substituted group.

In the 13C NMR:
- 21.3 and 28.4 (each 1C, s): These are probably two different methyl carbons. One is around 21, which is more like a CH3 attached to something de-shielded? Or maybe a CH3 in a ring? The 28 is a bit higher, maybe a CH3 attached to an oxygen or another substituent.
The aromatic carbons are around 126-130, which is typical for aromatic carbons, maybe some double bonds or substituents. The 141.5 and 144.1 are probably carbons attached to substituents, like carbonyls or double bonds. Oh wait, 197.7 is a very high shift, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. But wait, the product's molecular formula would be important here. Let me think about the initial formula.

Compound X is C11H12O. Let's check what the product would be. The reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane likely leads to an elimination, perhaps forming an epoxide or something else. Wait, but epoxide rings are usually O in a three-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, like dehydrogenation.

Wait, the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. Hmm. Or wait, could it be an epoxide? Or maybe a ketone.

Wait, the possible options are A, B, C, D. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. That's an oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group attached at position 2. Styryl is a vinylbenzene. So the structure would be something like an epoxide ring where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons is connected to a styryl group. So the styryl would have a benzene ring with a double bond and a methyl group in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane ring has a substituent at position 2. The substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to a phenyl. So it's like a CH2 group attached to the epoxide, with a double bond to a benzene ring. Wait, that's similar to a styryl but perhaps with more substituents.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That's an epoxide where the styryl group is attached to the epoxide ring. So the structure is similar to option A, perhaps.

Wait, but the product's 13C has a carbonyl at 197.7. But oxirane (epoxide) doesn’t have a carbonyl. So that's confusing. Unless the reaction forms a ketone. Wait, if the starting material is an epoxide and upon reaction something happens, but wait, the reaction is with a base. Maybe an acid-catalyzed ring opening? But the solvent is nonpolar, and temperature is 403 K, which is pretty hot. Alternatively, maybe Compound X is a diol or something that upon elimination forms an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a diol, and the reaction with a base causes elimination to form an epoxide. But the product's 13C has a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So what reaction between Compound X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane would form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, and the starting material was an epoxide which upon opening under basic conditions forms a diol, but that doesn't align with the data here.

Wait another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. It's often used in elimination reactions, like the E2 mechanism. So perhaps the starting material has a structure that upon deprotonation and elimination forms a double bond, maybe conjugated with another group.

Wait, looking at the product's 1H NMR: the aromatic signals. Let me think.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons are split into doublets. Let me sketch the possible structures.

Suppose the product has a benzene ring with substituents that give rise to these signals. Let me think about the coupling patterns.

Looking at the aromatic region:
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): Maybe a proton next to a substituent that's causing coupling.
- 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons, perhaps a pair in a para-substituted benzene.
- 7.68 (1H, d): Another proton that's adjacent to a substituent.
- 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons, possibly para to another substituent.

Alternatively, maybe this is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, as in a styryl group. Styryl groups have a double bond between two carbons, one of which is attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, let's think about the 13C NMR. The two singlets at 21.3 and 28.4 are likely two different methyl groups. One is more upfield (21), perhaps attached to an aromatic ring (like a toluene group), and the other (28.4) might be attached to something else, maybe an oxygen or part of a double bond.

The 13C NMR also has a carbon at 197.7. That's high, so maybe a ketone. Wait, but if the product has a ketone, how does that come from the starting material? Unless the starting material was a diol, and upon elimination, a ketone is formed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the product could be an epoxide with some substituents. Let me think about the options again. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide would have a styryl group attached. So the structure would be a three-membered ring (epoxide) where one of the oxygen-connected carbons is attached to a styryl group.

So, the styryl group is a benzene ring connected by a double bond to a CH2 group. Wait no, styryl is a vinylbenzene, so it's a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, styryl is a benzene ring with a vinyl group: benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is the group where a benzene ring is connected via a double bond to a CH2 group. So benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is typically a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, like benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, I think styryl is the group Ph-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, styryl is a benzene ring connected to a double bond. So, it's benzene-CH2-CH2? No, that's more like a propenyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: styryl is a substituent where a benzene ring is attached to a double bond. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Styryl is benzene-CH=CH2? Or is it benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, more accurately, styryl is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, so it's benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the correct structure is benzene-CH=CH2. So the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that would be ethenylbenzene. Wait, the correct structure is Ph-CH=CH2.

So, if the product is 2-styrylepoxide (option D), the structure would be an epoxide (oxirane) where one of the carbons in the epoxide is connected to a styryl group. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-benzene

Wait no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So the structure would be:

O
|| 
C - CH2-CH2-benzene

Wait, but the epoxide ring would have two adjacent carbons, each attached to the oxygen. So if one of those carbons is connected to the styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2-?), that would be the structure.

But wait, the NMR data includes a carbonyl group. So if the product is an epoxide, where is the carbonyl coming from? Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the starting material was an epoxide that opened under basic conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement, which involves elimination of water to form a carbonyl. Pinacol rearrangement occurs when a diol (1,2-diol) is heated under acidic conditions to form a ketone, but the reagent here is a base, and the solvent is nonpolar. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diol which upon elimination forms a ketone. Let's think about that.

But let me look at the product's molecular formula. The starting material is C11H12O. After reaction, what's the product formula? Let's see: if it's an elimination reaction, perhaps losing water (H2O), so the product would be C11H10O. But wait, the product's NMR data doesn't mention a specific shift for oxygenated groups, unless it's in the carbonyl.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a ketone. So the product is a ketone. So if the starting material is a diol (two OH groups), elimination of water would form a ketone. But the starting material's formula is C11H12O. If two OH groups are present, the formula would be C11H10O2. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide (which has one O), and the reaction doesn't change the O count.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide plus something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a conjugated enone, which would have a carbonyl and a double bond.

Let me think about the options again. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure would have an epoxide ring and a styryl group attached. But the 13C NMR has a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with a styryl group. Let me think about the options. Option B and C have oxirane (epoxide) rings, so the product would have an epoxide.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a carbonyl. So perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but a ketone. So maybe the reaction forms a ketone. So the starting material is an epoxide that undergoes ring-opening under basic conditions. But wait, under basic conditions, epoxides can open to form alcohols or other products. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol that forms a ketone via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene that forms a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options and their structures.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide (oxirane) with a styryl group attached at position 2. The styryl group is a benzene ring attached to a CH=CH2 group. So the epoxide would have a structure like O connected to two CH2 groups, one of which is attached to the styryl group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-Ph-CH2?

Wait, no. It's more likely O connected to two carbons, one of which is attached to the styryl group. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-Ph-CH2?

No, wait, the structure is more accurately:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph

Wait, no, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph (but that's not right; styryl is Ph-CH=CH2.

So, the correct structure for option A would be the epoxide ring connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a benzene ring via a double bond. So, O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, wait, it's O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2, but that doesn't fit. Maybe the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR signals.

The 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. So, in option A, the styryl group would be Ph-CH2-CH2-Oxirane. Wait, no, the styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2? Or is it O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the oxirane is a three-membered ring with oxygen and two carbons. The substituent on C2 is a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that's a single bond. But styryl has a double bond. So maybe it's O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2 with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So, O-C-CH2-CH2=Ph? Wait no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between the CH2 and CH2, making it a styryl group. So, O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph becomes O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. But wait, that would be a double bond between the second and third carbon, making it a styryl group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2 - CH=Ph

Wait, but the double bond would be CH2-CH=Ph. So the substituent is CH2-CH=Ph. So the structure is O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

In that case, the aromatic ring would have a methyl group in the para position (as per 4-methylstyryl group), meaning the benzene ring has a methyl group opposite the point of attachment.

So, the substituent would be CH2-CH=Ph where the benzene ring has a methyl group in the para position.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's consider the aromatic protons.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has four signals. Let's see.

If the substituent is a styryl group (CH2-CH=Ph) attached to the epoxide, the ring would have substituents that lead to the observed splitting.

But let me think about the coupling. For a styryl group, the double bond would be between the CH2 and the benzene. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2=Ph-CH2?

Wait, no, more accurately, the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH=Ph (but the Ph has a methyl group in para position).

So, the double bond is between CH2 and CH, with the CH connected to the benzene ring, which has a methyl in the para position.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons would be as follows: the CH2 group next to the epoxide is connected to a CH which is double-bonded to the benzene. The benzene would have substituents that lead to specific coupling patterns.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps with substituents that cause coupling. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group causing coupling.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, you'd typically see two doublets each integrating to 2H. But here, we have four different signals. So perhaps it's not a simple para-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is causing some kind of coupling due to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is attached in a way that creates a conjugated system, leading to different shifts.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a benzene ring with substituents that lead to the observed NMR signals.

Wait, another approach: looking at the 13C NMR.

The 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product contains a ketone group. That changes things. So the product is a ketone.

So the starting material must have been a diol (two OH groups) that upon elimination of water (under basic conditions) forms a ketone.

Wait, but if the starting material is C11H12O, and the product is C11H10O (losing H2O), that would fit. So the product formula would be C11H10O.

But the product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl, so it's a ketone. So the product is a ketone.

So the starting material is a diol, and upon elimination, forms a ketone.

But then, what is the structure of the starting material?

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the product shows a singlet for 3H at δ 2.28 and 2.31. These are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them, like a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Wait, if the product is a ketone with two methyl groups, perhaps attached to the carbonyl.

But wait, in the 13C NMR, the carbonyl is at 197.7, which would be a ketone (about 205-220 for esters, but 190-210 for ketones). So 197.7 is a ketone.

So the product has a structure with a ketone and two methyl groups, perhaps in a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring with some substituents.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. If the product is this, then the 13C NMR should show an epoxide's carbon signals. But the product's 13C has a carbonyl. So unless the reaction forms a ketone, this might not fit.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not an elimination but a ring-opening. If the starting material is an epoxide and the base opens it, perhaps leading to a diol or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't an epoxide but something else, and the reaction forms an epoxide.

Wait, the options suggest that all the options except D are epoxides. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is an epoxide with a styryl group.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR signals again.

The aromatic signals in the product's 1H NMR are:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

This looks like a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene? Or maybe a pattern from a para-substituted benzene with another substituent causing coupling.

Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group attached to the benzene, causing the splitting of the aromatic protons.

Wait, for example, in a para-substituted styryl group, the protons on the double bond would cause coupling with the aromatic protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has substituents in such a way that each H is coupled to others, leading to the observed doublets.

Wait, another angle: let's look at the coupling constants. But the question doesn't provide J values, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the product has two doublets of doublets or something, but without J values, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another approach: the singlet at δ 2.28 and 2.31 in the 1H NMR. Two different singlets for 3H each. So two different methyl groups. One is at 21.3 in 13C, another at 28.4. The lower shift (21) is likely a CH3 attached to an aromatic ring (like toluene), while the higher (28.4) could be attached to an oxygen or another group, like a CH3CO group.

But in the product, 13C shows a carbonyl at 197.7, so if that's a ketone, perhaps the structure has a (CH3)2CO group attached to something else.

Wait, but the molecular formula of the product would be C11H10O if it's a ketone, assuming the starting material was C11H12O and we lost two H (from elimination). But let's check the options' molecular formulas.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O, and the product after reaction (if elimination of H2O) would be C11H10O. Let's see what each option's product would be.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The formula would be C11H12O.

Wait, but the product in the problem statement must be C11H10O, because it's after elimination. Wait, no—the product's formula isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR has 10 H's: 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 protons. Wait, 3 (2.28) + 3 (2.31) = 6, plus 1+2+1+2 =6. Total 12. So the product must have 12 H's. So the molecular formula is C11H12O, same as the starting material. That suggests no elimination, so maybe it's an isomerization or rearrangement.

Ah, that changes things. So the product has the same molecular formula as the starting material. So the reaction is an isomerization, perhaps an acid-catalyzed rearrangement or a base-induced rearrangement.

So, moving forward, the product's 13C has a carbonyl, which suggests that the product is a ketone. But the starting material is C11H12O, which is also a ketone? Or the starting material might be an epoxide or another structure.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is C11H12O. If it's an epoxide, the formula would be C11H10O (since epoxide is O in a three-membered ring, but that's not possible because epoxide is O, so the formula would be C11H10O. But the starting material has C11H12O. So perhaps the starting material is a diol or something else.

Wait, let's take the product's 13C NMR. The carbonyl at 197.7 suggests a ketone. Then, the other carbons: 126-130 are aromatic, 141-144 are perhaps carbons attached to substituents or in conjugated systems.

The two singlets at 21 and 28 are likely two methyl groups. The 126.9 and 127.1 are two carbons, perhaps in an aromatic ring. The 129.1 and 130.3 are maybe more aromatic carbons, and the 141.5 and 144.1 are probably carbons attached to the ketone or the substituents.

So, putting this together: the product is a ketone with two methyl groups, a benzene ring, and perhaps an epoxide or another group.

Wait, but the product's 13C doesn't show any oxygen besides the carbonyl, right? Because the starting material has one O, and the product has one O as well (since formula is same). So the product's O is in the ketone group.

So, the structure likely has a benzene ring with substituents, a ketone group, and two methyl groups.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. That would have an epoxide ring with a substituent that's a phenylpropenyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the product. If the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, perhaps it's an elimination to form a conjugated diene or a ketone.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups. So the product has two different methyl groups, each as singlets. So they're likely attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like attached to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

The 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7 (carbonyl), so the structure would be something like (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, could the product be a benzophenone derivative? But the molecular formula doesn't fit.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. If the product is a ketone, the formula would be C11H10O. But the product has 12 H's, so maybe not.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this by considering each option's structure and how it would appear in NMR.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: epoxide ring with a substituent which is a 4-methylstyryl group. So, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2- (but with a double bond, so Ph-CH=CH2, with a methyl on the benzene in para position).

The product would have an epoxide ring, a styryl group (which is a benzene ring with a double bond), and a methyl group.

In the 13C NMR, the epoxide carbons would have specific shifts. Wait, but the product's 13C has a carbonyl, which the epoxide doesn't have. So this option might not fit.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure: epoxide ring with substituent at position 2, which is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to a phenyl. So, the substituent is Ph-C(CH2)-CH2? Or Ph-C=CH2.

Wait, structure would be O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Not sure, but in any case, the product would have an epoxide and a substituted double bond attached to a benzene.

The 13C NMR has a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: an epoxide ring with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So, O-C(CH3)-CH2-Ph-CH2? No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the substituent would be a styryl group at position 3.

In this case, the product would have an epoxide, a methyl group, and a styryl group. But again, the 13C NMR has a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: epoxide ring with a styryl group attached at position 2. So, O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. The Ph has a substituent. In this case, the structure would have an epoxide and a styryl group.

But again, no carbonyl in the product would be present. So why does the 13C NMR show a carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming the product is an epoxide. Maybe the reaction forms a ketone, and the starting material was an epoxide.

Wait, the reaction conditions are with a strong base and heat. So perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that undergoes ring-opening to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but under what conditions would an epoxide ring open to form a ketone? Typically, acid-catalyzed ring opening would lead to diols. Basic conditions might ring open to form alkenes or other products, but not ketones directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol that, upon elimination, forms a ketone. But the starting material's formula is C11H12O, which would need to lose H2O to form a ketone (C11H10O), but the product's NMR shows 12 H's, so same as starting material.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but an isomerization. For example, if the starting material is an epoxide with a substituent that can rearrange to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated enone, which would have both a double bond and a carbonyl. Let me think.

If the product is an enone, the 13C would have a carbonyl and a double bond. The 1H NMR would show protons on the double bond and the aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there's a signal at 6.75 (d) and 7.68 (d). These could be the protons on the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. The aromatic protons would show up elsewhere.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows four aromatic signals. So perhaps there's a benzene ring with substituents that cause the splitting.

Putting it all together, maybe the product is a benzalacetone or similar structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that would have an aldehyde proton, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted styryl ketone.

But I'm not making much progress.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 13C shift at 197.7 isn't a carbonyl but something else. Wait, but that's typically a carbonyl.

Wait, could it be an ester? Esters have carbonyls around 170-185. 197 is higher, more like a ketone.

So, back to the options. Maybe the product is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Wait, but that structure would have an epoxide ring and a substituent that's a propenyl group attached to a benzene. But again, no carbonyl. Unless the reaction forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (pinacol) upon elimination of water forms a ketone. But the diol would need to have two adjacent OH groups.

If the starting material is a diol, upon elimination, it forms a ketone, which would have a carbonyl. The product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl. So perhaps the starting material is a diol, and the product is a ketone.

But the starting material's formula is C11H12O. If it's a diol, the formula would be C11H10O2, because each OH adds an O. But that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the given data again.

The product's 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. 13C has two methyl carbons (21.3 and 28.4). Also, a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the product is (E)-4-methyl-3-phenylbut-2-en-1-one. Structure: (CH3)C(O)CH2PhCH2? No, wait, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring with a substituent.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The options are all epoxides with some substituents. But the product's data suggests a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide to form a diol, but under basic conditions, it might form a different product. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol that rearranges into a ketone upon treatment with a base.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol with a structure that upon elimination becomes a ketone. If the starting material is C11H12O, and the product is also C11H10O, but the product's NMR shows 12 H's, which is same as the starting material, that suggests no change in the number of H's. So perhaps it's not elimination but an isomerization.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. Let me think: under basic conditions, an epoxide could open with a base, but typically it would form an alkoxide, which could then lose a proton to form an elimination product, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, but if the base is strong and bulky, maybe it's causing a ring-opening followed by elimination to form a carbonyl. I'm not sure about the exact mechanism, but perhaps in some cases, a conjugated epoxide can form a ketone upon heating.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a structure that upon rearrangement forms a carbonyl.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should think differently.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. That might suggest a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted benzene, but that's uncommon. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing splitting.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic ring has substituents that are vicinal (next to each other), leading to coupling between the protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that is itself a double bond, causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets.

Wait, another thought: the aromatic signals could be from two different benzene rings. But the product's 13C NMR doesn't show enough carbons, so more likely it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Perhaps the structure is a methyl group, a carbonyl, and a styryl group attached to the epoxide.

Wait, but how would that fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cinnamyl group attached to a ketone.

But perhaps I should look for a compound with a ketone, two methyl groups, and a benzene ring.

Wait, if the product is a benzophenone derivative but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, think about the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 and 28.4: two methyl groups.

- 126.9, 127.1: perhaps two aromatic carbons.

- 129.1, 130.3: more aromatic.

- 141.5, 144.1: possibly carbons adjacent to substituents.

- 197.7: ketone.

So, the structure could have a benzene ring with substituents, a ketone group, and two methyl groups attached.

For example: The benzene ring has a substituent that is a carbonyl group attached to a CH(CH3)2 group. Or something like that.

Wait, but the options don't include such structures. All the options are epoxides with substituents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the product isn't a ketone but an epoxide with a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but I don't think that's possible. Epoxides are ethers, not carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form a conjugated double bond, making the epoxide part into a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the theoretical NMR data given. Let me see if the 1H NMR makes sense for a specific structure.

For example, let's say the product is 2-styrylepoxide (option D). So, the structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group attached. So, O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

In that case, the aromatic protons would come from the benzene ring. The CH2 group next to the epoxide would have protons, but in the 1H NMR, there are no signals around 4 ppm which would be typical for CH2 groups attached to oxygen. Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the only non-aromatic signals are the two singlets for methyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 groups are split in a way that integrates into the aromatic signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are part of the aromatic substituent, making their protons appear in the aromatic region.

Wait, perhaps the product is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure is O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. The aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring, which is attached via a double bond. The CH2 group next to the epoxide would have protons that would appear as multiplets, but in the given 1H NMR, the only non-aromatic signals are the two singlets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are not present, and the structure is O-C-CH=Ph. But that would require a different structure.

Wait, I'm stuck again. Let me think about the options' structures again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: epoxide ring with a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) attached at position 2. So the structure is O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

In this case, the product would have a benzene ring (Ph), a double bond (CH=Ph), and an epoxide ring. But the 13C NMR doesn't have any epoxide carbons. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Wait, the 13C NMR doesn't show any carbons in the 60-70 ppm range, which are typical for epoxide carbons. So the product can't be an epoxide. Thus, the correct option must not be an epoxide. So looking at the options, option D is an epoxide, so it's out.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

So, all options are epoxides. But the product's 13C doesn't show any epoxide carbons. So perhaps the correct option is not among them. But that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction transforms it into a non-epoxide structure with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base. So perhaps the epoxide ring opens under basic conditions.

In basic conditions, epoxides can open via nucleophilic attack. But without a clear nucleophile, perhaps it's an elimination. Wait, maybe the epoxide opens to form a carbonyl via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide with a neighboring group that allows for a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. For example, the base could deprotonate a beta-hydrogen, leading to an elimination and forming a double bond conjugated with a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a conjugated enone, which would have a carbonyl and a double bond. The 1H NMR would show the double bond protons as doublets, and the aromatic protons as per substitution.

In the 1H NMR, the signals around 7 ppm are the aromatic protons. The signals at 6.75 and 7.68 could be the double bond protons. Let me see:

Suppose the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. But that's a ketone with a benzene and two methyl groups. But the 1H NMR would show the double bond protons as multiplets, which it doesn't.

Alternatively, the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2. But the 1H NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups attached to the central carbon.

But the given 1H NMR has two singlets for 3H each. So that fits.

So, the structure would be (CH3)2CO-CH2-Ph. So, the ketone is at the end of a CH2 group attached to a benzene ring.

In that case, the 1H NMR would have:

- Two singlets for the two CH3 groups attached to the ketone.

- The CH2 group next to the ketone would have a triplet integrating to 2H, but there's no such signal in the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is split into a quartet or something else, but the given data doesn't show that.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then the CH2 would be between the carbonyl and the benzene.

Wait, but then the 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 and the CH(CH3)2. But the given data doesn't show that. So perhaps this isn't the right structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(O)CH2Ph. Then, the CH2Ph would have protons that would appear as a triplet or quartet, but again, the given data doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-Ph-CH2-CH3. But that's just a guess, and it doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2. The 1H NMR would have:

- Singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the central carbon (integral 6H), but the given data has two singlets for 3H each, which would sum to 6H. But in the given data, the two singlets are 3H each, so maybe it's (CH3)2CO attached to something else.

In that case, the structure would be (CH3)2CO-CH2-Ph. Then, the CH2-Ph would have protons that would appear as a triplet (if split by the Ph's protons), but the given data doesn't show such a signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CO-Ph, which would have the ketone directly attached to the benzene. But then, the CH2 group would be missing, and the product would have the aromatic protons.

Wait, let me think about the 13C NMR. If the structure is (CH3)2CO-Ph, the carbons would be:

- (CH3)2CO: the carbonyl at ~205 ppm, but the given is 197.7.

- The benzene carbons would be around 125-140 ppm.

But in the given 13C NMR, the carbonyl is at 197.7, which is a bit lower than expected for a ketone. But it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a simple ketone but has a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but without the aldehyde proton.

Wait, another angle: the 13C NMR has two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4. If the structure is (CH3)2C=O-CH2-Ph, then the CH2 would have a carbon around 30-40 ppm, which isn't present in the given data. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of a double bond.

Alternatively, the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-Ph. But then the CH2 groups would have their own signals.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to match the options' structures to the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph (Ph has a methyl in para position).

In this case, the 1H NMR would have:

- Methyl groups on the benzene (4-methyl) as singlets.

But the product's 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups, which could correspond to the 4-methyl on the benzene and another methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, but the structure of option A would have a CH2 group next to the epoxide and a CH=Ph group. The CH2 would have protons that would appear as a quartet or something, but in the 1H NMR, there's no such signal. So perhaps this option isn't matching.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

In this structure, the CH2 next to the epoxide would have protons, and the C(Ph)=CH2 group would have protons. The 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 and the CH2 group attached to the double bond.

But the given 1H NMR doesn't show signals in the regions where these protons would appear. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: O-C(CH3)-CH2-CH=Ph.

In this case, the CH2 group would have protons, but again, the given data doesn't show such signals. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

Same as option A but without the 4-methyl on the benzene.

In this case, the benzene would have no methyl substituent, so the 1H NMR would have different aromatic signals. But the given data has two singlets for 3H each, which suggests two methyl groups. So option D, which has no methyl on the benzene, doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is frustrating. Let me think about the 13C NMR again.

The 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is a ketone. So the product must be a ketone. Therefore, the correct option must somehow form a ketone from an epoxide. But all the options are epoxides, which doesn't have a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide to form a carbonyl. For example, if the starting material is an epoxide with a neighboring group that can form a carbonyl upon ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide with a geminal diol (like in a diol-epoxide), and upon treatment with a base, it undergoes a rearrangement to form a ketone.

But I'm not certain about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dienol ether, and the base induces a rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another approach: let's count the number of signals in the 13C NMR.

The 13C NMR has:

- 21.3 (s) → 1C

- 28.4 (s) → 1C

- 126.9 (2C) → 2C

- 127.1 (1C) → 1C

- 129.1 (2C) → 2C

- 130.3 (1C) → 1C

- 141.5 (1C) → 1C

- 144.1 (1C) → 1C

- 197.7 (1C) → 1C

Total of 11 carbons. The molecular formula is C11H12O. So that adds up.

The structure must have 11 carbons, including a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring with a substituent that leads to the observed NMR signals.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(O)CH2Ph. That would be 4-methylbenzylacetone or something similar.

In this structure, the 1H NMR would have:

- Two singlets for the two CH3 groups (δ ~2.1 and 2.3).

- The CH2 group between the ketone and benzene would have protons appearing around δ 2.5-3.5 as a triplet or quartet.

But the given 1H NMR doesn't have any signals in that region. So perhaps that's not the structure.

Alternatively, the CH2 is part of a double bond, making it a conjugated system. So, the structure would be (CH3)2C(O)CH2CH2Ph.

But again, the 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 groups, which aren't present.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COCH2CH2Ph, but that doesn't have a carbonyl in the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the 1H NMR would show:

- A singlet for the six H's from the two CH3 groups attached to the central carbon. But the given data has two singlets of 3H each, so this might fit if the CH3 groups are split into two different environments.

Wait, but (CH3)2CO would have two equivalent CH3 groups, giving a singlet. But in the given data, there are two singlets, which suggests two different CH3 groups.

So perhaps the structure is (CH3)COCH2CH2Ph, but that doesn't explain the NMR data.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is part of a ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product could be a coumaranone or similar structure, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trityl ketone, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzalacetone derivative. Benzalacetone has a structure like Ph-CH2-CO-CH3. Its 1H NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 group next to the benzene, a singlet for the CH3 attached to the ketone, and the aromatic protons.

But the given data doesn't have the triplet for the CH2, so that might not fit.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has two singlets for 3H each. So maybe it's a structure where the two CH3 groups are attached to different carbons, each with a singlet.

For example, (CH3)2CO-Ph. But the CH2 group is missing. So the structure would be (CH3)2CO directly attached to the benzene.

In that case, the 1H NMR would have:

- Two singlets for the two CH3 groups.

- The aromatic protons would show up as a singlet or multiple doublets, depending on substitution.

But the given 1H NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region. So perhaps the benzene is para-substituted with something else, causing the splitting.

Wait, but if the structure is (CH3)2CO-Ph, the benzene would have substituents that are attached directly to the ketone. But in that case, the substitution pattern would lead to specific NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-Ph, which would have a CH2 group between the ketone and benzene. The 1H NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 group, but that's not present in the data.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is part of a double bond. So, the structure would be (CH3)2CO-CH2-Ph → no, that doesn't form a double bond.

Alternatively, the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't explain the NMR data either.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to look at the options again and see which one's structure would produce the given NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph (Ph has a para methyl).

In this case, the 1H NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the epoxide would have protons, perhaps as a quartet or something.

- The CH=Ph group would have protons that could appear as a triplet or doublet.

But the given data doesn't have such signals, so perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

In this structure, the CH2 group would have protons, and the C(Ph)=CH2 group would have protons. But again, the given data doesn't show signals for these.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: O-C(CH3)-CH2-CH=Ph.

The CH2 group would have protons, which aren't present in the given data. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

Same issue as option A: the CH2 group's protons aren't present in the given data.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups are part of the aromatic ring substitution, making their protons appear in the aromatic region. For example, in a styryl group, the CH2 could be part of the double bond.

Wait, in the styryl group, it's Ph-CH=CH2. So the CH2 is part of the double bond. So, the structure would be O-C-CH2-CH=Ph, but the CH2 is part of the double bond, making it O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph. No, that's single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2, making it O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. But that would mean the CH2 is part of the double bond.

So the structure would be O-C-CH2-CH=Ph, but the CH2 is between the epoxide and the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 group would have protons that would appear as a quartet or something, but the given data doesn't show that.

Hmm, I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Because despite the 13C NMR showing a carbonyl, perhaps I'm missing something in the analysis.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a carbonyl, which epoxides don't have. So perhaps the correct option isn't an epoxide. But all options are epoxides except perhaps none. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't forming an epoxide but opening one. But the options are all epoxides, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which could be an ester carbonyl, but that's less likely. Esters are usually around 170.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes are around 95-100 ppm in 13C NMR, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The 13C of the carbonyl would be a bit lower, maybe around 197.7. So that makes sense.

In that case, the structure would have a double bond conjugated to the ketone. The 1H NMR would show the protons on the double bond as doublets.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the two doublets at 6.75 and 7.68 could be the protons on the double bond. The other doublets would be from the aromatic ring.

So, the structure would be something like Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond instead of a single bond between the C and O.

Wait, no. Let me think: the structure would be Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a single bond. Alternatively, Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH=CH2.

But that would have a double bond after the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a simple ketone without a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH=C-C(O)-CH3. That would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The 1H NMR would show the double bond protons as doublets, which matches the data.

In that case, the 13C NMR would have a carbonyl around 197.7, which fits.

The aromatic protons would then come from the benzene ring attached to the double bond. The substituents on the benzene would cause the observed splitting.

So, the structure would be something like Ph-CH=C(O)CH3. But wait, that would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

In this structure, the 1H NMR would show:

- The double bond protons (on CH=C(O)CH3) as two doublets, which matches the 6.75 and 7.68 signals.

- The aromatic protons as four doublets, which matches the other signals.

Additionally, the two methyl groups (Ph's para methyl and the ketone's methyl) would appear as singlets, which matches the 2.28 and 2.31 signals.

So, the structure would be (E)- or (Z)-4-methyl-3-phenyl-2-buten-4-one.

But looking at the molecular formula, C11H12O would fit this structure.

So, the starting material, after reaction, forms this conjugated ketone.

But the options are all epoxides, so perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Because the 1H NMR shows two methyl groups, which could correspond to the 4-methyl on the benzene and another methyl group attached to the epoxide.

But the 13C NMR doesn't show any epoxide carbons, which would be around 50-60 ppm. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but the starting material is. So the reaction transforms the epoxide into a ketone.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, I'm not sure.

In conclusion, based on the NMR data showing a carbonyl and two methyl groups, the product is likely a conjugated enone with a benzene ring and two methyl groups. Among the options, none directly match, but considering the possible structures, option D (2-styrylepoxide) doesn't fit because of the carbonyl. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but the starting material is. So the reaction forms a ketone. But all options are epoxides, which is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, and the reaction is at 403 K (230°C), which is quite hot. So perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that rearranges upon heating to form a more stable structure, like a ketone.

So, the starting material could be an epoxide that undergoes a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

Wait, the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement involves the shift of a carbocation to a more stable position, but under basic conditions, that might not happen. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed process, but the reaction is under basic conditions.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene epoxide, which upon treatment with a base forms a conjugated dienone.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent and the data, I'll have to make an educated guess. The product has a carbonyl, so the starting material must have been something that forms a ketone upon reaction. Among the options, none directly fit, but considering the structure, option D (2-styrylepoxide) is the most likely, despite the carbonyl discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the 13C peak at 197.7 isn't a carbonyl but something else, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR of option A would have a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) and an epoxide. The 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 groups, which aren't present. So I think option A isn't correct.

Given all this, I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on the reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the provided NMR data of the product. The reaction conditions suggest a possible elimination or rearrangement, and the NMR data must be analyzed to deduce the structure.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Molecular Formula and Reaction**:  
   Compound X has the formula C11H12O. The reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (a strong, bulky base) likely involves elimination or rearrangement. The product retains the same molecular formula (C11H12O), ruling out elimination of water or other small molecules.

2. **1H NMR Data**:  
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets for methyl groups, likely attached to different environments.  
   - Aromatic region: δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d). These signals suggest a substituted aromatic ring with coupling patterns consistent with a para-substituted benzene or a conjugated system.

3. **13C NMR Data**:  
   - Two methyl carbons at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4.  
   - A carbonyl carbon at δ 197.7, indicating the presence of a ketone.  
   - Aromatic carbons and carbons attached to substituents are also observed.

4. **Structure of the Product**:  
   The presence of a carbonyl group (δ 197.7 in 13C NMR) suggests the product is a ketone. The two methyl groups (δ 2.28 and δ 2.31 in 1H NMR) likely belong to a dimethyl ketone. The aromatic signals indicate a benzene ring with substituents.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)**: This structure contains an epoxide ring and a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) with a methyl group in the para position. However, the 13C NMR data does not show epoxide carbons (expected around 50-60 ppm), making this option unlikely.  
   - **Option B (2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane)**: This structure includes an epoxide and a propenyl group attached to a benzene. The 1H NMR data does not show signals for protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide, ruling this out.  
   - **Option C (2-methyl-3-styryloxirane)**: This structure has an epoxide ring with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. The 1H NMR data lacks signals for the CH2 group near the epoxide, making this option inconsistent.  
   - **Option D (2-styrylepoxide)**: This structure contains an epoxide ring with a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2). While the aromatic signals match, the absence of epoxide carbons in the 13C NMR and the presence of a carbonyl group suggest this is not the correct structure.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The product must be a ketone with a carbonyl group, as indicated by the 13C NMR data. None of the options explicitly match this description. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option A (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)** is the most plausible choice, despite the inconsistency with the 13C NMR data.

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR spectra of the product after a reaction. Alright, let's break it down.

So, Compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used base, often used in the Corey-Fuchs reaction or maybe something else. Oh wait, no, more likely, it's used in the elimination reactions, maybe as a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps it's deprotonating something in Compound X, leading to an elimination or a rearrangement.

The product's NMR data is given. So the reaction is probably an elimination, like forming a double bond or modifying an existing one. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the peak. Maybe an aromatic ring or an electronegative atom. Wait, but in what context?
- 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, but a different shift. Could be another methyl group, maybe on a benzene ring as a substituent. Styryl groups have methyl substituents sometimes.
The aromatic region:
- 6.75 (1H, d): Doublet, so coupling with one neighboring proton.
- 7.08 (2H, d): Doublet, two protons. Maybe a pair of H's in a para-substituted benzene or something similar.
- 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet, maybe another H in a substituted ring.
- 7.71 (2H, d): Two H's, doublet, perhaps part of a para-substituted group.

In the 13C NMR:
- 21.3 and 28.4 (each 1C, s): These are probably two different methyl carbons. One is around 21, which is more like a CH3 attached to something de-shielded? Or maybe a CH3 in a ring? The 28 is a bit higher, maybe a CH3 attached to an oxygen or another substituent.
The aromatic carbons are around 126-130, which is typical for aromatic carbons, maybe some double bonds or substituents. The 141.5 and 144.1 are probably carbons attached to substituents, like carbonyls or double bonds. Oh wait, 197.7 is a very high shift, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. But wait, the product's molecular formula would be important here. Let me think about the initial formula.

Compound X is C11H12O. Let's check what the product would be. The reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane likely leads to an elimination, perhaps forming an epoxide or something else. Wait, but epoxide rings are usually O in a three-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, like dehydrogenation.

Wait, the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. Hmm. Or wait, could it be an epoxide? Or maybe a ketone.

Wait, the possible options are A, B, C, D. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. That's an oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group attached at position 2. Styryl is a vinylbenzene. So the structure would be something like an epoxide ring where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons is connected to a styryl group. So the styryl would have a benzene ring with a double bond and a methyl group in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane ring has a substituent at position 2. The substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to a phenyl. So it's like a CH2 group attached to the epoxide, with a double bond to a benzene ring. Wait, that's similar to a styryl but perhaps with more substituents.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That's an epoxide where the styryl group is attached to the epoxide ring. So the structure is similar to option A, perhaps.

Wait, but the product's 13C has a carbonyl at 197.7. But oxirane (epoxide) doesn’t have a carbonyl. So that's confusing. Unless the reaction forms a ketone. Wait, if the starting material is an epoxide and upon reaction something happens, but wait, the reaction is with a base. Maybe an acid-catalyzed ring opening? But the solvent is nonpolar, and temperature is 403 K, which is pretty hot. Alternatively, maybe Compound X is a diol or something that upon elimination forms an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a diol, and the reaction with a base causes elimination to form an epoxide. But the product's 13C has a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So what reaction between Compound X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane would form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, and the starting material was an epoxide which upon opening under basic conditions forms a diol, but that doesn't align with the data here.

Wait another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. It's often used in elimination reactions, like the E2 mechanism. So perhaps the starting material has a structure that upon deprotonation and elimination forms a double bond, maybe conjugated with another group.

Wait, looking at the product's 1H NMR: the aromatic signals. Let me think.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons are split into doublets. Let me sketch the possible structures.

Suppose the product has a benzene ring with substituents that give rise to these signals. Let me think about the coupling patterns.

Looking at the aromatic region:
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): Maybe a proton next to a substituent that's causing coupling.
- 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons, perhaps a pair in a para-substituted benzene.
- 7.68 (1H, d): Another proton that's adjacent to a substituent.
- 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons, possibly para to another substituent.

Alternatively, maybe this is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, as in a styryl group. Styryl groups have a double bond between two carbons, one of which is attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, let's think about the 13C NMR. The two singlets at 21.3 and 28.4 are likely two different methyl groups. One is more upfield (21), perhaps attached to an aromatic ring (like a toluene group), and the other (28.4) might be attached to something else, maybe an oxygen or part of a double bond.

The 13C NMR also has a carbon at 197.7. That's high, so maybe a ketone. Wait, but if the product has a ketone, how does that come from the starting material? Unless the starting material was a diol, and upon elimination, a ketone is formed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the product could be an epoxide with some substituents. Let me think about the options again. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide would have a styryl group attached. So the structure would be a three-membered ring (epoxide) where one of the oxygen-connected carbons is attached to a styryl group.

So, the styryl group is a benzene ring connected by a double bond to a CH2 group. Wait no, styryl is a vinylbenzene, so it's a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, styryl is a benzene ring with a vinyl group: benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is the group where a benzene ring is connected via a double bond to a CH2 group. So benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is typically a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, like benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, I think styryl is the group Ph-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, styryl is a benzene ring connected to a double bond. So, it's benzene-CH2-CH2? No, that's more like a propenyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: styryl is a substituent where a benzene ring is attached to a double bond. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Styryl is benzene-CH=CH2? Or is it benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, more accurately, styryl is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, so it's benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the correct structure is benzene-CH=CH2. So the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that would be ethenylbenzene. Wait, the correct structure is Ph-CH=CH2.

So, if the product is 2-styrylepoxide (option D), the structure would be an epoxide (oxirane) where one of the carbons in the epoxide is connected to a styryl group. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-benzene

Wait no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So the structure would be:

O
|| 
C - CH2-CH2-benzene

Wait, but the epoxide ring would have two adjacent carbons, each attached to the oxygen. So if one of those carbons is connected to the styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2-?), that would be the structure.

But wait, the NMR data includes a carbonyl group. So if the product is an epoxide, where is the carbonyl coming from? Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the starting material was an epoxide that opened under basic conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement, which involves elimination of water to form a carbonyl. Pinacol rearrangement occurs when a diol (1,2-diol) is heated under acidic conditions to form a ketone, but the reagent here is a base, and the solvent is nonpolar. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diol which upon elimination forms a ketone. Let's think about that.

But let me look at the product's molecular formula. The starting material is C11H12O. After reaction, what's the product formula? Let's see: if it's an elimination reaction, perhaps losing water (H2O), so the product would be C11H10O. But wait, the product's NMR data doesn't mention a specific shift for oxygenated groups, unless it's in the carbonyl.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a ketone. So the product is a ketone. So if the starting material is a diol (two OH groups), elimination of water would form a ketone. But the starting material's formula is C11H12O. If two OH groups are present, the formula would be C11H10O2. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide (which has one O), and the reaction doesn't change the O count.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide plus something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a conjugated enone, which would have a carbonyl and a double bond.

Let me think about the options again. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure would have an epoxide ring and a styryl group attached. But the 13C NMR has a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with a styryl group. Let me think about the options. Option B and C have oxirane (epoxide) rings, so the product would have an epoxide.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a carbonyl. So perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but a ketone. So maybe the reaction forms a ketone. So the starting material is an epoxide that undergoes ring-opening under basic conditions. But wait, under basic conditions, epoxides can open to form alcohols or other products. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol that forms a ketone via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene that forms a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options and their structures.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide (oxirane) with a styryl group attached at position 2. The styryl group is a benzene ring attached to a CH=CH2 group. So the epoxide would have a structure like O connected to two CH2 groups, one of which is attached to the styryl group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-Ph-CH2?

Wait, no. It's more likely O connected to two carbons, one of which is attached to the styryl group. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-Ph-CH2?

No, wait, the structure is more accurately:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph

Wait, no, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph (but that's not right; styryl is Ph-CH=CH2.

So, the correct structure for option A would be the epoxide ring connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a benzene ring via a double bond. So, O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, wait, it's O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2, but that doesn't fit. Maybe the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR signals.

The 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. So, in option A, the styryl group would be Ph-CH2-CH2-Oxirane. Wait, no, the styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2? Or is it O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the oxirane is a three-membered ring with oxygen and two carbons. The substituent on C2 is a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that's a single bond. But styryl has a double bond. So maybe it's O-C-CH2-Ph-CH2 with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So, O-C-CH2-CH2=Ph? Wait no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between the CH2 and CH2, making it a styryl group. So, O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph becomes O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. But wait, that would be a double bond between the second and third carbon, making it a styryl group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2 - CH=Ph

Wait, but the double bond would be CH2-CH=Ph. So the substituent is CH2-CH=Ph. So the structure is O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

In that case, the aromatic ring would have a methyl group in the para position (as per 4-methylstyryl group), meaning the benzene ring has a methyl group opposite the point of attachment.

So, the substituent would be CH2-CH=Ph where the benzene ring has a methyl group in the para position.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's consider the aromatic protons.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has four signals. Let's see.

If the substituent is a styryl group (CH2-CH=Ph) attached to the epoxide, the ring would have substituents that lead to the observed splitting.

But let me think about the coupling. For a styryl group, the double bond would be between the CH2 and the benzene. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2=Ph-CH2?

Wait, no, more accurately, the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH=Ph (but the Ph has a methyl group in para position).

So, the double bond is between CH2 and CH, with the CH connected to the benzene ring, which has a methyl in the para position.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons would be as follows: the CH2 group next to the epoxide is connected to a CH which is double-bonded to the benzene. The benzene would have substituents that lead to specific coupling patterns.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps with substituents that cause coupling. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group causing coupling.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, you'd typically see two doublets each integrating to 2H. But here, we have four different signals. So perhaps it's not a simple para-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is causing some kind of coupling due to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is attached in a way that creates a conjugated system, leading to different shifts.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a benzene ring with substituents that lead to the observed NMR signals.

Wait, another approach: looking at the 13C NMR.

The 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product contains a ketone group. That changes things. So the product is a ketone.

So the starting material must have been a diol (two OH groups) that upon elimination of water (under basic conditions) forms a ketone.

Wait, but if the starting material is C11H12O, and the product is C11H10O (losing H2O), that would fit. So the product formula would be C11H10O.

But the product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl, so it's a ketone. So the product is a ketone.

So the starting material is a diol, and upon elimination, forms a ketone.

But then, what is the structure of the starting material?

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the product shows a singlet for 3H at δ 2.28 and 2.31. These are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them, like a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Wait, if the product is a ketone with two methyl groups, perhaps attached to the carbonyl.

But wait, in the 13C NMR, the carbonyl is at 197.7, which would be a ketone (about 205-220 for esters, but 190-210 for ketones). So 197.7 is a ketone.

So the product has a structure with a ketone and two methyl groups, perhaps in a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring with some substituents.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. If the product is this, then the 13C NMR should show an epoxide's carbon signals. But the product's 13C has a carbonyl. So unless the reaction forms a ketone, this might not fit.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not an elimination but a ring-opening. If the starting material is an epoxide and the base opens it, perhaps leading to a diol or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't an epoxide but something else, and the reaction forms an epoxide.

Wait, the options suggest that all the options except D are epoxides. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is an epoxide with a styryl group.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR signals again.

The aromatic signals in the product's 1H NMR are:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

This looks like a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene? Or maybe a pattern from a para-substituted benzene with another substituent causing coupling.

Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group attached to the benzene, causing the splitting of the aromatic protons.

Wait, for example, in a para-substituted styryl group, the protons on the double bond would cause coupling with the aromatic protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has substituents in such a way that each H is coupled to others, leading to the observed doublets.

Wait, another angle: let's look at the coupling constants. But the question doesn't provide J values, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the product has two doublets of doublets or something, but without J values, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another approach: the singlet at δ 2.28 and 2.31 in the 1H NMR. Two different singlets for 3H each. So two different methyl groups. One is at 21.3 in 13C, another at 28.4. The lower shift (21) is likely a CH3 attached to an aromatic ring (like toluene), while the higher (28.4) could be attached to an oxygen or another group, like a CH3CO group.

But in the product, 13C shows a carbonyl at 197.7, so if that's a ketone, perhaps the structure has a (CH3)2CO group attached to something else.

Wait, but the molecular formula of the product would be C11H10O if it's a ketone, assuming the starting material was C11H12O and we lost two H (from elimination). But let's check the options' molecular formulas.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O, and the product after reaction (if elimination of H2O) would be C11H10O. Let's see what each option's product would be.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The formula would be C11H12O.

Wait, but the product in the problem statement must be C11H10O, because it's after elimination. Wait, no—the product's formula isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR has 10 H's: 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 protons. Wait, 3 (2.28) + 3 (2.31) = 6, plus 1+2+1+2 =6. Total 12. So the product must have 12 H's. So the molecular formula is C11H12O, same as the starting material. That suggests no elimination, so maybe it's an isomerization or rearrangement.

Ah, that changes things. So the product has the same molecular formula as the starting material. So the reaction is an isomerization, perhaps an acid-catalyzed rearrangement or a base-induced rearrangement.

So, moving forward, the product's 13C has a carbonyl, which suggests that the product is a ketone. But the starting material is C11H12O, which is also a ketone? Or the starting material might be an epoxide or another structure.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is C11H12O. If it's an epoxide, the formula would be C11H10O (since epoxide is O in a three-membered ring, but that's not possible because epoxide is O, so the formula would be C11H10O. But the starting material has C11H12O. So perhaps the starting material is a diol or something else.

Wait, let's take the product's 13C NMR. The carbonyl at 197.7 suggests a ketone. Then, the other carbons: 126-130 are aromatic, 141-144 are perhaps carbons attached to substituents or in conjugated systems.

The two singlets at 21 and 28 are likely two methyl groups. The 126.9 and 127.1 are two carbons, perhaps in an aromatic ring. The 129.1 and 130.3 are maybe more aromatic carbons, and the 141.5 and 144.1 are probably carbons attached to the ketone or the substituents.

So, putting this together: the product is a ketone with two methyl groups, a benzene ring, and perhaps an epoxide or another group.

Wait, but the product's 13C doesn't show any oxygen besides the carbonyl, right? Because the starting material has one O, and the product has one O as well (since formula is same). So the product's O is in the ketone group.

So, the structure likely has a benzene ring with substituents, a ketone group, and two methyl groups.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. That would have an epoxide ring with a substituent that's a phenylpropenyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the product. If the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, perhaps it's an elimination to form a conjugated diene or a ketone.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups. So the product has two different methyl groups, each as singlets. So they're likely attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like attached to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

The 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7 (carbonyl), so the structure would be something like (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, could the product be a benzophenone derivative? But the molecular formula doesn't fit.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. If the product is a ketone, the formula would be C11H10O. But the product has 12 H's, so maybe not.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this by considering each option's structure and how it would appear in NMR.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: epoxide ring with a substituent which is a 4-methylstyryl group. So, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2- (but with a double bond, so Ph-CH=CH2, with a methyl on the benzene in para position).

The product would have an epoxide ring, a styryl group (which is a benzene ring with a double bond), and a methyl group.

In the 13C NMR, the epoxide carbons would have specific shifts. Wait, but the product's 13C has a carbonyl, which the epoxide doesn't have. So this option might not fit.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure: epoxide ring with substituent at position 2, which is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to a phenyl. So, the substituent is Ph-C(CH2)-CH2? Or Ph-C=CH2.

Wait, structure would be O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Not sure, but in any case, the product would have an epoxide and a substituted double bond attached to a benzene.

The 13C NMR has a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: an epoxide ring with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So, O-C(CH3)-CH2-Ph-CH2? No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the substituent would be a styryl group at position 3.

In this case, the product would have an epoxide, a methyl group, and a styryl group. But again, the 13C NMR has a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: epoxide ring with a styryl group attached at position 2. So, O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. The Ph has a substituent. In this case, the structure would have an epoxide and a styryl group.

But again, no carbonyl in the product would be present. So why does the 13C NMR show a carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming the product is an epoxide. Maybe the reaction forms a ketone, and the starting material was an epoxide.

Wait, the reaction conditions are with a strong base and heat. So perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that undergoes ring-opening to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but under what conditions would an epoxide ring open to form a ketone? Typically, acid-catalyzed ring opening would lead to diols. Basic conditions might ring open to form alkenes or other products, but not ketones directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diol that, upon elimination, forms a ketone. But the starting material's formula is C11H12O, which would need to lose H2O to form a ketone (C11H10O), but the product's NMR shows 12 H's, so same as starting material.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but an isomerization. For example, if the starting material is an epoxide with a substituent that can rearrange to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated enone, which would have both a double bond and a carbonyl. Let me think.

If the product is an enone, the 13C would have a carbonyl and a double bond. The 1H NMR would show protons on the double bond and the aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there's a signal at 6.75 (d) and 7.68 (d). These could be the protons on the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. The aromatic protons would show up elsewhere.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows four aromatic signals. So perhaps there's a benzene ring with substituents that cause the splitting.

Putting it all together, maybe the product is a benzalacetone or similar structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that would have an aldehyde proton, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted styryl ketone.

But I'm not making much progress.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 13C shift at 197.7 isn't a carbonyl but something else. Wait, but that's typically a carbonyl.

Wait, could it be an ester? Esters have carbonyls around 170-185. 197 is higher, more like a ketone.

So, back to the options. Maybe the product is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Wait, but that structure would have an epoxide ring and a substituent that's a propenyl group attached to a benzene. But again, no carbonyl. Unless the reaction forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (pinacol) upon elimination of water forms a ketone. But the diol would need to have two adjacent OH groups.

If the starting material is a diol, upon elimination, it forms a ketone, which would have a carbonyl. The product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl. So perhaps the starting material is a diol, and the product is a ketone.

But the starting material's formula is C11H12O. If it's a diol, the formula would be C11H10O2, because each OH adds an O. But that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the given data again.

The product's 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. 13C has two methyl carbons (21.3 and 28.4). Also, a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the product is (E)-4-methyl-3-phenylbut-2-en-1-one. Structure: (CH3)C(O)CH2PhCH2? No, wait, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring with a substituent.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The options are all epoxides with some substituents. But the product's data suggests a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide to form a diol, but under basic conditions, it might form a different product. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol that rearranges into a ketone upon treatment with a base.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol with a structure that upon elimination becomes a ketone. If the starting material is C11H12O, and the product is also C11H10O, but the product's NMR shows 12 H's, which is same as the starting material, that suggests no change in the number of H's. So perhaps it's not elimination but an isomerization.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. Let me think: under basic conditions, an epoxide could open with a base, but typically it would form an alkoxide, which could then lose a proton to form an elimination product, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, but if the base is strong and bulky, maybe it's causing a ring-opening followed by elimination to form a carbonyl. I'm not sure about the exact mechanism, but perhaps in some cases, a conjugated epoxide can form a ketone upon heating.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a structure that upon rearrangement forms a carbonyl.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should think differently.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. That might suggest a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted benzene, but that's uncommon. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing splitting.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic ring has substituents that are vicinal (next to each other), leading to coupling between the protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that is itself a double bond, causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets.

Wait, another thought: the aromatic signals could be from two different benzene rings. But the product's 13C NMR doesn't show enough carbons, so more likely it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Perhaps the structure is a methyl group, a carbonyl, and a styryl group attached to the epoxide.

Wait, but how would that fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cinnamyl group attached to a ketone.

But perhaps I should look for a compound with a ketone, two methyl groups, and a benzene ring.

Wait, if the product is a benzophenone derivative but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, think about the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 and 28.4: two methyl groups.

- 126.9, 127.1: perhaps two aromatic carbons.

- 129.1, 130.3: more aromatic.

- 141.5, 144.1: possibly carbons adjacent to substituents.

- 197.7: ketone.

So, the structure could have a benzene ring with substituents, a ketone group, and two methyl groups attached.

For example: The benzene ring has a substituent that is a carbonyl group attached to a CH(CH3)2 group. Or something like that.

Wait, but the options don't include such structures. All the options are epoxides with substituents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the product isn't a ketone but an epoxide with a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but I don't think that's possible. Epoxides are ethers, not carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form a conjugated double bond, making the epoxide part into a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the theoretical NMR data given. Let me see if the 1H NMR makes sense for a specific structure.

For example, let's say the product is 2-styrylepoxide (option D). So, the structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group attached. So, O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

In that case, the aromatic protons would come from the benzene ring. The CH2 group next to the epoxide would have protons, but in the 1H NMR, there are no signals around 4 ppm which would be typical for CH2 groups attached to oxygen. Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the only non-aromatic signals are the two singlets for methyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 groups are split in a way that integrates into the aromatic signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are part of the aromatic substituent, making their protons appear in the aromatic region.

Wait, perhaps the product is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure is O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. The aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring, which is attached via a double bond. The CH2 group next to the epoxide would have protons that would appear as multiplets, but in the given 1H NMR, the only non-aromatic signals are the two singlets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are not present, and the structure is O-C-CH=Ph. But that would require a different structure.

Wait, I'm stuck again. Let me think about the options' structures again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: epoxide ring with a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) attached at position 2. So the structure is O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

In this case, the product would have a benzene ring (Ph), a double bond (CH=Ph), and an epoxide ring. But the 13C NMR doesn't have any epoxide carbons. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Wait, the 13C NMR doesn't show any carbons in the 60-70 ppm range, which are typical for epoxide carbons. So the product can't be an epoxide. Thus, the correct option must not be an epoxide. So looking at the options, option D is an epoxide, so it's out.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

So, all options are epoxides. But the product's 13C doesn't show any epoxide carbons. So perhaps the correct option is not among them. But that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction transforms it into a non-epoxide structure with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base. So perhaps the epoxide ring opens under basic conditions.

In basic conditions, epoxides can open via nucleophilic attack. But without a clear nucleophile, perhaps it's an elimination. Wait, maybe the epoxide opens to form a carbonyl via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide with a neighboring group that allows for a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. For example, the base could deprotonate a beta-hydrogen, leading to an elimination and forming a double bond conjugated with a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a conjugated enone, which would have a carbonyl and a double bond. The 1H NMR would show the double bond protons as doublets, and the aromatic protons as per substitution.

In the 1H NMR, the signals around 7 ppm are the aromatic protons. The signals at 6.75 and 7.68 could be the double bond protons. Let me see:

Suppose the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. But that's a ketone with a benzene and two methyl groups. But the 1H NMR would show the double bond protons as multiplets, which it doesn't.

Alternatively, the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2. But the 1H NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups attached to the central carbon.

But the given 1H NMR has two singlets for 3H each. So that fits.

So, the structure would be (CH3)2CO-CH2-Ph. So, the ketone is at the end of a CH2 group attached to a benzene ring.

In that case, the 1H NMR would have:

- Two singlets for the two CH3 groups attached to the ketone.

- The CH2 group next to the ketone would have a triplet integrating to 2H, but there's no such signal in the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is split into a quartet or something else, but the given data doesn't show that.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then the CH2 would be between the carbonyl and the benzene.

Wait, but then the 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 and the CH(CH3)2. But the given data doesn't show that. So perhaps this isn't the right structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(O)CH2Ph. Then, the CH2Ph would have protons that would appear as a triplet or quartet, but again, the given data doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-Ph-CH2-CH3. But that's just a guess, and it doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2. The 1H NMR would have:

- Singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the central carbon (integral 6H), but the given data has two singlets for 3H each, which would sum to 6H. But in the given data, the two singlets are 3H each, so maybe it's (CH3)2CO attached to something else.

In that case, the structure would be (CH3)2CO-CH2-Ph. Then, the CH2-Ph would have protons that would appear as a triplet (if split by the Ph's protons), but the given data doesn't show such a signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CO-Ph, which would have the ketone directly attached to the benzene. But then, the CH2 group would be missing, and the product would have the aromatic protons.

Wait, let me think about the 13C NMR. If the structure is (CH3)2CO-Ph, the carbons would be:

- (CH3)2CO: the carbonyl at ~205 ppm, but the given is 197.7.

- The benzene carbons would be around 125-140 ppm.

But in the given 13C NMR, the carbonyl is at 197.7, which is a bit lower than expected for a ketone. But it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a simple ketone but has a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but without the aldehyde proton.

Wait, another angle: the 13C NMR has two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4. If the structure is (CH3)2C=O-CH2-Ph, then the CH2 would have a carbon around 30-40 ppm, which isn't present in the given data. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of a double bond.

Alternatively, the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-Ph. But then the CH2 groups would have their own signals.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to match the options' structures to the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph (Ph has a methyl in para position).

In this case, the 1H NMR would have:

- Methyl groups on the benzene (4-methyl) as singlets.

But the product's 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups, which could correspond to the 4-methyl on the benzene and another methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, but the structure of option A would have a CH2 group next to the epoxide and a CH=Ph group. The CH2 would have protons that would appear as a quartet or something, but in the 1H NMR, there's no such signal. So perhaps this option isn't matching.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

In this structure, the CH2 next to the epoxide would have protons, and the C(Ph)=CH2 group would have protons. The 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 and the CH2 group attached to the double bond.

But the given 1H NMR doesn't show signals in the regions where these protons would appear. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: O-C(CH3)-CH2-CH=Ph.

In this case, the CH2 group would have protons, but again, the given data doesn't show such signals. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

Same as option A but without the 4-methyl on the benzene.

In this case, the benzene would have no methyl substituent, so the 1H NMR would have different aromatic signals. But the given data has two singlets for 3H each, which suggests two methyl groups. So option D, which has no methyl on the benzene, doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is frustrating. Let me think about the 13C NMR again.

The 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is a ketone. So the product must be a ketone. Therefore, the correct option must somehow form a ketone from an epoxide. But all the options are epoxides, which doesn't have a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide to form a carbonyl. For example, if the starting material is an epoxide with a neighboring group that can form a carbonyl upon ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide with a geminal diol (like in a diol-epoxide), and upon treatment with a base, it undergoes a rearrangement to form a ketone.

But I'm not certain about the exact mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dienol ether, and the base induces a rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another approach: let's count the number of signals in the 13C NMR.

The 13C NMR has:

- 21.3 (s) → 1C

- 28.4 (s) → 1C

- 126.9 (2C) → 2C

- 127.1 (1C) → 1C

- 129.1 (2C) → 2C

- 130.3 (1C) → 1C

- 141.5 (1C) → 1C

- 144.1 (1C) → 1C

- 197.7 (1C) → 1C

Total of 11 carbons. The molecular formula is C11H12O. So that adds up.

The structure must have 11 carbons, including a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CO attached to a benzene ring with a substituent that leads to the observed NMR signals.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(O)CH2Ph. That would be 4-methylbenzylacetone or something similar.

In this structure, the 1H NMR would have:

- Two singlets for the two CH3 groups (δ ~2.1 and 2.3).

- The CH2 group between the ketone and benzene would have protons appearing around δ 2.5-3.5 as a triplet or quartet.

But the given 1H NMR doesn't have any signals in that region. So perhaps that's not the structure.

Alternatively, the CH2 is part of a double bond, making it a conjugated system. So, the structure would be (CH3)2C(O)CH2CH2Ph.

But again, the 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 groups, which aren't present.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)COCH2CH2Ph, but that doesn't have a carbonyl in the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the 1H NMR would show:

- A singlet for the six H's from the two CH3 groups attached to the central carbon. But the given data has two singlets of 3H each, so this might fit if the CH3 groups are split into two different environments.

Wait, but (CH3)2CO would have two equivalent CH3 groups, giving a singlet. But in the given data, there are two singlets, which suggests two different CH3 groups.

So perhaps the structure is (CH3)COCH2CH2Ph, but that doesn't explain the NMR data.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is part of a ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product could be a coumaranone or similar structure, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trityl ketone, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzalacetone derivative. Benzalacetone has a structure like Ph-CH2-CO-CH3. Its 1H NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 group next to the benzene, a singlet for the CH3 attached to the ketone, and the aromatic protons.

But the given data doesn't have the triplet for the CH2, so that might not fit.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has two singlets for 3H each. So maybe it's a structure where the two CH3 groups are attached to different carbons, each with a singlet.

For example, (CH3)2CO-Ph. But the CH2 group is missing. So the structure would be (CH3)2CO directly attached to the benzene.

In that case, the 1H NMR would have:

- Two singlets for the two CH3 groups.

- The aromatic protons would show up as a singlet or multiple doublets, depending on substitution.

But the given 1H NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region. So perhaps the benzene is para-substituted with something else, causing the splitting.

Wait, but if the structure is (CH3)2CO-Ph, the benzene would have substituents that are attached directly to the ketone. But in that case, the substitution pattern would lead to specific NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-Ph, which would have a CH2 group between the ketone and benzene. The 1H NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 group, but that's not present in the data.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is part of a double bond. So, the structure would be (CH3)2CO-CH2-Ph → no, that doesn't form a double bond.

Alternatively, the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't explain the NMR data either.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to look at the options again and see which one's structure would produce the given NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph (Ph has a para methyl).

In this case, the 1H NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the epoxide would have protons, perhaps as a quartet or something.

- The CH=Ph group would have protons that could appear as a triplet or doublet.

But the given data doesn't have such signals, so perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

In this structure, the CH2 group would have protons, and the C(Ph)=CH2 group would have protons. But again, the given data doesn't show signals for these.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: O-C(CH3)-CH2-CH=Ph.

The CH2 group would have protons, which aren't present in the given data. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Structure: O-C-CH2-CH=Ph.

Same issue as option A: the CH2 group's protons aren't present in the given data.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups are part of the aromatic ring substitution, making their protons appear in the aromatic region. For example, in a styryl group, the CH2 could be part of the double bond.

Wait, in the styryl group, it's Ph-CH=CH2. So the CH2 is part of the double bond. So, the structure would be O-C-CH2-CH=Ph, but the CH2 is part of the double bond, making it O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph. No, that's single bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2, making it O-C-CH2-CH=Ph. But that would mean the CH2 is part of the double bond.

So the structure would be O-C-CH2-CH=Ph, but the CH2 is between the epoxide and the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 group would have protons that would appear as a quartet or something, but the given data doesn't show that.

Hmm, I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Because despite the 13C NMR showing a carbonyl, perhaps I'm missing something in the analysis.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a carbonyl, which epoxides don't have. So perhaps the correct option isn't an epoxide. But all options are epoxides except perhaps none. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't forming an epoxide but opening one. But the options are all epoxides, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which could be an ester carbonyl, but that's less likely. Esters are usually around 170.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes are around 95-100 ppm in 13C NMR, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The 13C of the carbonyl would be a bit lower, maybe around 197.7. So that makes sense.

In that case, the structure would have a double bond conjugated to the ketone. The 1H NMR would show the protons on the double bond as doublets.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the two doublets at 6.75 and 7.68 could be the protons on the double bond. The other doublets would be from the aromatic ring.

So, the structure would be something like Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond instead of a single bond between the C and O.

Wait, no. Let me think: the structure would be Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a single bond. Alternatively, Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH=CH2.

But that would have a double bond after the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a simple ketone without a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH=C-C(O)-CH3. That would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The 1H NMR would show the double bond protons as doublets, which matches the data.

In that case, the 13C NMR would have a carbonyl around 197.7, which fits.

The aromatic protons would then come from the benzene ring attached to the double bond. The substituents on the benzene would cause the observed splitting.

So, the structure would be something like Ph-CH=C(O)CH3. But wait, that would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

In this structure, the 1H NMR would show:

- The double bond protons (on CH=C(O)CH3) as two doublets, which matches the 6.75 and 7.68 signals.

- The aromatic protons as four doublets, which matches the other signals.

Additionally, the two methyl groups (Ph's para methyl and the ketone's methyl) would appear as singlets, which matches the 2.28 and 2.31 signals.

So, the structure would be (E)- or (Z)-4-methyl-3-phenyl-2-buten-4-one.

But looking at the molecular formula, C11H12O would fit this structure.

So, the starting material, after reaction, forms this conjugated ketone.

But the options are all epoxides, so perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Because the 1H NMR shows two methyl groups, which could correspond to the 4-methyl on the benzene and another methyl group attached to the epoxide.

But the 13C NMR doesn't show any epoxide carbons, which would be around 50-60 ppm. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but the starting material is. So the reaction transforms the epoxide into a ketone.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, I'm not sure.

In conclusion, based on the NMR data showing a carbonyl and two methyl groups, the product is likely a conjugated enone with a benzene ring and two methyl groups. Among the options, none directly match, but considering the possible structures, option D (2-styrylepoxide) doesn't fit because of the carbonyl. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but the starting material is. So the reaction forms a ketone. But all options are epoxides, which is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, and the reaction is at 403 K (230°C), which is quite hot. So perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that rearranges upon heating to form a more stable structure, like a ketone.

So, the starting material could be an epoxide that undergoes a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

Wait, the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement involves the shift of a carbocation to a more stable position, but under basic conditions, that might not happen. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed process, but the reaction is under basic conditions.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene epoxide, which upon treatment with a base forms a conjugated dienone.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent and the data, I'll have to make an educated guess. The product has a carbonyl, so the starting material must have been something that forms a ketone upon reaction. Among the options, none directly fit, but considering the structure, option D (2-styrylepoxide) is the most likely, despite the carbonyl discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the 13C peak at 197.7 isn't a carbonyl but something else, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR of option A would have a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) and an epoxide. The 1H NMR would have signals for the CH2 groups, which aren't present. So I think option A isn't correct.

Given all this, I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.


The question involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on the reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the provided NMR data of the product. The reaction conditions suggest a possible elimination or rearrangement, and the NMR data must be analyzed to deduce the structure.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Molecular Formula and Reaction**:  
   Compound X has the formula C11H12O. The reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (a strong, bulky base) likely involves elimination or rearrangement. The product retains the same molecular formula (C11H12O), ruling out elimination of water or other small molecules.

2. **1H NMR Data**:  
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets for methyl groups, likely attached to different environments.  
   - Aromatic region: δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d). These signals suggest a substituted aromatic ring with coupling patterns consistent with a para-substituted benzene or a conjugated system.

3. **13C NMR Data**:  
   - Two methyl carbons at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4.  
   - A carbonyl carbon at δ 197.7, indicating the presence of a ketone.  
   - Aromatic carbons and carbons attached to substituents are also observed.

4. **Structure of the Product**:  
   The presence of a carbonyl group (δ 197.7 in 13C NMR) suggests the product is a ketone. The two methyl groups (δ 2.28 and δ 2.31 in 1H NMR) likely belong to a dimethyl ketone. The aromatic signals indicate a benzene ring with substituents.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)**: This structure contains an epoxide ring and a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) with a methyl group in the para position. However, the 13C NMR data does not show epoxide carbons (expected around 50-60 ppm), making this option unlikely.  
   - **Option B (2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane)**: This structure includes an epoxide and a propenyl group attached to a benzene. The 1H NMR data does not show signals for protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide, ruling this out.  
   - **Option C (2-methyl-3-styryloxirane)**: This structure has an epoxide ring with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. The 1H NMR data lacks signals for the CH2 group near the epoxide, making this option inconsistent.  
   - **Option D (2-styrylepoxide)**: This structure contains an epoxide ring with a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2). While the aromatic signals match, the absence of epoxide carbons in the 13C NMR and the presence of a carbonyl group suggest this is not the correct structure.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The product must be a ketone with a carbonyl group, as indicated by the 13C NMR data. None of the options explicitly match this description. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option A (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)** is the most plausible choice, despite the inconsistency with the 13C NMR data.

ANSWER: A
