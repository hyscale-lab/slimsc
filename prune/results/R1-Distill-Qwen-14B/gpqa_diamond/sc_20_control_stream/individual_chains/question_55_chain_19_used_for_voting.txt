Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me see. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all types of propenyl or butenyl acetates—either cis or trans. Hmm, I remember that the configuration (cis or trans) affects the NMR signals, especially the splitting patterns and coupling constants.

The given NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I need to figure out what each peak corresponds to. Let me break this down.

First, acetates typically have an ester group, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, acetate is an ester from acetic acid, so it's more like R-O-CO-CH3. Wait, no: the structure is R-O-CO-O-CH3? Wait no, no. Acetate esters are R-O-CO-OCH3? Or is it R-O-CO-R', but wait, no. Let me correct that. An acetate ester is formed from acetic acid, so it's R-O-CO-CH3. So the general structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the ester group would be O-CO-O... Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ester functional group is O-CO-O, but in an acetate, the R group is from the acid, which is acetic acid. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

So the options are about propenyl and butenyl groups attached to the oxygen. So the structure is something like CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2... or with double bonds.

Wait, no. Let me think. The options are propenyl acetate and butenyl acetate. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2 for propenyl acetate, but the position of the substituents (like where the double bond is) affects the NMR.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- attached to O. So propenyl groups have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, like CH2=CHCH2-O-.

But the question is about whether the substituents (like the ester group) are cis or trans relative to the double bond. So in the case of propenyl acetate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

But wait, when the substituents are on either end of the double bond, their configuration (cis or trans) affects the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the configuration of the substituents around the double bond in the propenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, the double bond is between the two middle carbons, leading to different splitting patterns.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on either side of the double bond are the acetate group and the other two substituents. Let me think. For example, in cis-propenyl acetate, the substituents on either end of the double bond (like the oxygen from the ester and the two CH2 groups) would be on the same side. Similarly, for trans, they would be opposite.

But wait, perhaps the actual structure is more like CH2CH2CH2-O-acetyl, but with a double bond in the propenyl group. So, for example, CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3? Or perhaps the propenyl group is part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR is showing the splitting patterns due to coupling between protons on adjacent carbons, especially around the double bond.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz). A doublet with a large coupling constant (16 Hz) suggests that this proton is coupled to one other proton, perhaps through a double bond. Maybe it's a vinylic proton.

- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). This is a doublet of quadruplets? Wait, no, 'dq' probably means doublet of quartets. Or maybe it's a doublet with some additional splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of doublets. Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, in the data, it's written as 5.5 (1H, dq). So 'dq' could mean doublet of quadruplets, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps it's a doublet of doublets, but that would be written as dd. Hmm, maybe the correct term is 'dq' for a doublet with another splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet and a quartet, but that's not standard notation. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets—so two different coupling constants.

Wait, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps I should focus on the other parts of the spectrum.

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is likely the methyl group from the acetate, since the acetate ester has a -O-CO-CH3 group. The singlet means no adjacent protons, which fits the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 or CH group. Because a doublet means coupling to one proton. So perhaps this methyl is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH group. Alternatively, if it's a CH2CH3 group, but that might produce a triplet. Wait, let me think. If a methyl group (CH3) is attached to a CH group (like CH2CH3), then the CH3 would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But here the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so perhaps the methyl is attached to a CH group that has only one adjacent proton. Hmm, maybe it's in a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-. Then, the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be split in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe it's a butenyl group, which would have four carbons in the chain, with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. Let me list them:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: the structure would have the substituents (like the OAc group and the other two substituents) on the same side of the double bond.

2. Trans-propenyl acetate: substituents on opposite sides.

3. Cis-butenyl acetate: similar, but with a four-carbon chain and a double bond.

4. Trans-butenyl acetate: substituents opposite each other on the butenyl group.

Wait, but butenyl could have the double bond between C1 and C2 (1,2-double bond) or between C2 and C3 (2,3). I think in propenyl, it's a three-carbon group with a double bond between C1 and C2. For butenyl, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3 (since propenyl is three carbons, so butenyl would have four, but the position of the double bond varies the structure.

But perhaps I should think about the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which is typical for coupling between two vinylic protons. So maybe these are the two protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond, but in this case, it's a doublet, so perhaps one of them is coupled to another.

Wait, a doublet for a proton suggests that it's coupled to one other proton. So in a double bond, each vinylic proton is typically coupled to two others, unless it's a trans configuration. Wait, no, each proton is coupled to the adjacent proton on the same carbon chain.

Wait, let me think. For a structure like CH2=CHCH2-O-Ac, the protons on the CH2=CH group would be split into a doublet of doublets, but perhaps in this case, it's a doublet because of coupling to another proton elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2OAc but with a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something else.

Wait, let me try to visualize the possible structures.

Option C is cis-propenyl acetate. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that would make the ester group OAc attached to the CH2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Now, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group.

Now, the H on C2 would be next to the double bond. Let me think about their splitting.

In this structure, the CH2 group adjacent to the OAc would have protons. Let's say the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, perhaps it's more about the propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe it's an allyl ester. So the ester oxygen is attached to a propenyl group. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the middle carbons. So CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that's the structure for propenyl acetate. Now, in the NMR, the vinylic protons would show specific splitting.

In such a structure, the protons on the CH2 and CH=CH2 would be as follows:

The CH2 group (the one attached to the OAc) would have two protons (let's say as a triplet because adjacent to a CH2 group), but wait, no. The CH2 group attached to O would be next to a CH (if the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond). Wait, no, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So O-CH2-CH2-CH2- would have a double bond between the first and second carbons, making it CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, that's not correct. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the O is attached to the CH2, which is attached to CH=CH2.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 (attached to O) would be next to the CH group (which is part of the double bond). So the CH2-O would have two protons, which are adjacent to the CH which is attached to the double bond.

So the protons on CH2-O would split into a triplet because each is adjacent to the CH (which has two protons, but wait, no. The CH (attached to the double bond) has one proton? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the middle CH would have two protons? No, wait: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc would have the structure where the CH2 is the first carbon, then the CH is the second carbon (double bond between C1 and C2), and the third carbon is CH2 attached to OAc.

Wait, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, that's butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is propenyl acetate.

In that structure, the propenyl group is CH2-CH=CH2 attached to O. So the first CH2 is attached to O, then the next CH is double bonded to CH2.

Wait, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the CH2 is attached to O, then the next CH is connected via a double bond to the CH2.

So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Now, for the NMR, the vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH2 group.

The protons on the CH=CH2 would couple with each other. So each of the two protons on the double bond would be a doublet because each is coupled to the other. So in the NMR, each would show as a doublet with J around 16 Hz, which is typical for trans coupling.

Wait, but in the given data, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. So that fits with two vinylic protons coupled to each other.

But wait, in the data, there's a peak at 7.0 ppm (1H, d) and another at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). That suggests two different vinylic protons, each coupling with others.

Let me think: the CH2=CH- group would have two protons, each coupled to each other. So each would be a doublet. But in the data, there's only one peak at 7.0 ppm (1H, d) and another at 5.5 ppm (1H, something else).

Hmm, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl but butenyl. Let's think about butenyl acetate.

Butenyl could be either 1,2-diene or 2,3-diene. For butenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, but butenyl groups have four carbons. So for example, OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's 3-pentenyl or something. Hmm, perhaps butenyl is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, maybe another approach. The 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetate methyl. The 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps in a CH2CH3 group. But wait, if it's a CH2CH3, the CH3 would be a triplet. So maybe it's a CH group where the CH has a methyl attached.

Wait, another possibility: the 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2 or CH group.

But perhaps I should consider the coupling in the vinylic region.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a large J (16 Hz), which is typical for trans coupling between two vinylic protons.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq, which suggests maybe a doublet of doublets or some other splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, maybe the structure has more than two vinylic protons. But in propenyl, there are two vinylic protons. In butenyl, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, then perhaps the structure has two vinylic protons as well. Let me think about 2-butenyl acetate. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc. Hmm, but then the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2. No, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it.

Butenyl group: four carbons. If the double bond is between C2 and C3, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's not possible because butenyl is an alkyl chain attached to the oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. In that case, the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me think again about the NMR data.

The presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H suggests it's a methyl group not adjacent to any protons, which fits the acetate's methyl.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH or CH2 group. So perhaps the structure has a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. No, but the doublet is for a CH3.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm doublet could be a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2. But in that case, the coupling would lead to a triplet. So that's not matching. So perhaps it's a methyl on a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would make the CH2 group attached to the O, then a CH group with a methyl and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the C3 has a methyl group attached.

In that case, the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. The protons on C2 would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) group, which would have a proton. So the proton on C2 would couple with the proton on C1 (J=16 Hz), and also with the proton on C3 (maybe a smaller coupling).

Wait, but in that case, the proton on C2 would be split into a doublet of doublets, perhaps. So in the NMR, it might appear as a doublet of doublets or a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps focusing on the number of protons in each signal. The 7.0 ppm (1H, d) suggests one proton, and the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests another. So perhaps the structure has only two vinylic protons, each giving a different signal.

In propenyl groups, there are two vinylic protons. So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. In this structure, the CH2 is attached to O, then the CH=CH2 is attached.

So the vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH2 part. Let's split this into the two protons on the double bond.

In a trans configuration (trans-propenyl acetate), the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. Each would couple with the other, giving a doublet each. But in the data, we have two different peaks for the vinylic region: one at 7.0 ppm (d) and another at 5.5 ppm (dq).

Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinylic protons is also coupled to another group, like the adjacent CH2. Let me think: for the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 group (attached to O) is adjacent to the CH=CH2 group. So the CH2 protons would be next to the CH which is part of the double bond.

So the CH2-O would have protons that are adjacent to the CH=CH2. So each proton on CH2-O would be split by the adjacent CH protons. But the CH=CH2 has two protons, each with a coupling J of about 16 Hz between them.

Wait, but the data shows that the vinylic protons are at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. So perhaps the two vinylic protons are in different environments.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, so they would be equivalent due to symmetry, giving a single doublet. But in the data, they're at two different ppm values. That suggests they're in different environments, which would happen in the cis case.

Wait, no. If the substituents are cis, then the two vinylic protons are on the same side. But how would that affect their chemical shifts?

Wait, for example, in cis-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons are on the same side as the OAc group. So one of them (the one on the same carbon as the OAc) would be deshielded more, appearing at a higher ppm, while the other would be more shielded, appearing at a lower ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of diastereotopic protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure has an additional substituent that causes the two vinylic protons to be non-equivalent. For example, if one of the vinylic protons is adjacent to a CH2 group and the other is adjacent to a CH group with a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2. No, but then the substituents would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the CH2 is attached to O, then a CH(CH3) attached to a double bond.

In that case, the double bond is between the CH(CH3) and the CH2. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 of the double bond. Wait, no, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the CH2 is attached to O, then the C(CH3) is attached via a double bond to CH2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me sketch it:

OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

So the C(CH3) is connected via a double bond to the CH2 group. So the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 part. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-C=CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other peaks. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, a proton that's adjacent to a CH2 group and also adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the splitting pattern can tell us about the structure. The doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz suggests a proton coupled to another vinylic proton. The other vinylic proton is at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets or doublet of doublets.

In the case of cis-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons are on the same side, so they might be next to each other and couple with each other and perhaps with adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a proton that's coupled to two different adjacent protons, causing a more complex splitting.

Wait, considering the options again. The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So let's think about each option and their expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the substituents (OAc and the other groups) on the same side of the double bond.

In this case, the two vinylic protons (on CH=CH2) would be in different environments because one is adjacent to the CH2-O and the other is at the end. So their chemical shifts would be different.

So the proton next to the OAc (on the CH2) would couple with the double bond proton, and perhaps with the adjacent CH2. Wait, but the CH2 is attached to O, so the two protons on CH2 would be next to the CH=CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the OAc is on the CH2, which is attached to the CH=CH2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH group. The CH2=CH would have two protons. The CH2 (attached to O) has two protons, and the CH (from CH2=CH) has two protons.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is as follows: the protons on the CH2=CH would couple with each other (J=16 Hz), and the CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH protons.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, and 5.5 is a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is one vinylic proton, and the 5.5 is another, each with different coupling.

Wait, let's consider the coupling between the CH2-O and the CH=CH2 group.

The CH2-O has two protons, each adjacent to the CH which is part of the double bond. So each of these CH2 protons would be split by the adjacent CH protons.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the trans and cis configurations.

In a trans configuration, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, which could mean that their coupling is larger (maybe around 16 Hz). In the cis case, the coupling might be similar, but their chemical environments could be different.

In the data, the 7.0 ppm doublet and 5.5 ppm dq suggest two different vinylic protons, which implies that the substituents around the double bond are different on each side. This would happen in a cis configuration because one side has the OAc group and the other has a different substituent, like a CH2.

So in cis-propenyl acetate, one vinylic proton is next to the OAc group, and the other is next to the CH2 group. That would make their chemical shifts different, as their environments are different.

So for the vinylic protons:

- The proton closer to OAc (the CH2 attached to O) would experience a different environment than the one on the other end. So their chemical shifts would be different.

The 7.0 ppm peak could be the more deshielded proton (next to the OAc), and the 5.5 ppm peak could be the other.

Additionally, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps this is the CH(CH3) group in the structure. Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Unless there's another substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure has a methyl branch. For example, OAc-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2. No, but that doesn't fit with the propenyl.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to a double bond. So the structure could be OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the C(CH3) would have a methyl group attached, and the double bond would be between C(CH3) and CH2.

So the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 part of the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm methyl is part of a CH2CH3 group, but that would usually give a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't include a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is part of a substituent on the double bond. Like OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that again doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere, making it butenyl.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the butenyl options.

If the structure is butenyl acetate, the double bond could be between C2 and C3. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on the CH=CH2 group. The CH2 groups are attached to O and the double bond.

The protons on the CH2-O would be adjacent to the CH2, which is adjacent to the double bond. So their splitting would be influenced by the adjacent CH2 and the double bond.

The vinylic protons would be a doublet each, but perhaps in the case of cis or trans, their chemical shifts would differ.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex due to coupling with adjacent groups.

But perhaps the presence of a methyl group at 1.6 ppm suggests that there's a methyl substituent somewhere, possibly on a CH group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm methyl is part of a geminal group, like OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me try a different approach: the coupling constants.

The J value of 16 Hz in the 7.0 ppm doublet suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic protons. So perhaps the substituents on either side of the double bond are trans, leading to a large J.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the substituents (like OAc and the adjacent CH2) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the two vinylic protons would be trans to each other, giving a larger J.

But how does that affect the NMR signals?

In trans-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons would be in different environments. For example, one is next to the OAc group, and the other is next to the CH2 group. So their chemical shifts would be different, leading to two separate signals: one at 7.0 ppm (d) and another at 5.5 ppm (dq).

The dq at 5.5 ppm could be due to coupling with two different protons. For example, the proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to both the other vinylic proton (J=16 Hz) and perhaps a neighboring CH2 group's proton (smaller J).

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a proton that's adjacent to both the double bond and another group, leading to more splitting.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH or CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm methyl could be part of a CH2 group attached to a CH that's part of the double bond. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but again, without a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is part of a substituent on the double bond. For example, OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2. In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH(CH2CH3) is on C2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons would be on C3 (the CH2 part). The CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton that's adjacent to the double bond, which would couple with the vinylic proton.

So the vinylic proton (on C3) would couple with the adjacent CH(CH2CH3) proton, leading to a doublet. Additionally, it might couple with another proton elsewhere.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm methyl is part of a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. For example, OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but again, without a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 would have a double bond between C3 and C4, making it OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would be a butenyl group.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on C3 and C4. The C4 would have a CH2 group, perhaps with a methyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the CH(CH3) is on C3, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. The vinylic protons would be on C4 (CH2) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

But the C4 would have a CH2 group, so the protons there would be a triplet or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the C2 being CH2 attached to O, and C3 being C(CH3)=CH2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons would be on C3 and C4. The C(CH3)=CH2 would have a vinylic proton on C4, and the C3 would have a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the protons on the double bond are on C3 and C4. So the structure would have OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the vinylic proton on C4 would be a doublet (coupled with the C3 proton), and the C3 proton would be a doublet as well. But the C3 has a CH(CH3) group, so perhaps the C3 proton is split into a doublet of doublets because it's coupled with both the C4 vinylic proton and the adjacent CH2 group's protons.

So the vinylic proton at C4 would be a doublet at around 7.0 ppm due to coupling with C3's proton (J=16 Hz). The C3 proton would be a doublet of doublets (because it's coupled to C4 and to the adjacent CH2's protons), which might appear around 5.5 ppm as a dq.

This would match the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), 5.5 ppm (dq), and the methyl groups at 2.1 (s) and 1.6 (d).

Wait, but where does the 1.6 ppm doublet come from? The CH(CH3) group would have a proton, but it's a CH, not a CH3. So the 1.6 ppm could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but in the structure OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, the C(CH3) has a methyl group. The CH2 group attached to O would have two protons. The C(CH3) would have a proton that's adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but the methyl group itself (CH3) would be attached to the C(CH3), which is part of the double bond. So the methyl group would be a singlet? No, because the C(CH3) is attached to the double bond, which is a sp2 hybridized carbon. So the methyl group's protons would be split based on their coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, no, the methyl group (CH3) is attached to a sp3 carbon (the C(CH3)), which is connected to the double bond. So the methyl group's protons are on a CH3, which is attached to a CH, which is part of the double bond.

But the CH3 would be a singlet only if it's not adjacent to any protons. Wait, no, being adjacent to a CH would cause splitting. So the CH3 would be a singlet? Or a doublet?

Wait, the CH3 is attached to a CH (which is part of the double bond). The CH has one proton. So the CH3 would be split into a doublet because each of its protons is coupled with the adjacent CH's proton.

But in reality, the CH3 would be a septet if adjacent to a CH2, but here it's adjacent to a CH. So each proton in CH3 would couple with the single proton on CH, leading to a doublet for the CH3. But that would be a triplet for the CH3, because each CH3 proton is coupled with the single CH proton.

Wait, no. The splitting of the CH3 group depends on how many neighbors it has. If the CH3 is attached to a CH group (which has one proton), then the CH3 would be a doublet. Because each CH3 proton is coupled with the single proton on the adjacent CH.

But in the NMR data, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H, d), which would fit this scenario: the CH3 is split into a doublet by the adjacent CH proton.

So putting it all together:

The structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

The NMR would show:

- The acetate methyl (OAc's CH3): 2.1 ppm, singlet (3H).

- The CH2-O group's protons: adjacent to the CH(CH3), so their protons would be split into a triplet or some other pattern. But in the data, the 1.6 ppm is the CH3, not the CH2.

Wait, the CH2-O group's protons would be on the CH2 next to the CH(CH3). So each of these two protons would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) proton, leading to a triplet for each. But since they're on a CH2, their splitting would be a quartet? No, wait, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH with one proton. Each proton on CH2 would be split into a doublet of doublets, but since there are two equivalent protons, it would appear as a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group (O-CH2-) is adjacent to the CH(CH3)=CH2 group. So the two protons on the CH2 would each be coupled to the adjacent CH's proton. So each would be a doublet, but since there are two equivalent protons, their combined splitting would be a triplet.

But in the data given, the CH2 protons aren't mentioned. Wait, perhaps the CH2 is a triplet, but it's not in the given data. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 protons are at a lower ppm and not mentioned, but the given data only shows the vinylic and methyl groups.

But in the given data, the 1.6 ppm is the CH3 (doublet), and the 5.5 ppm is the CH(CH3) proton, which is a doublet of doublets.

So the structure would be:

OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this structure:

- The CH3 on the C(CH3) is a doublet (coupled with the adjacent CH proton).

- The CH proton on C(CH3) is coupled with both the adjacent CH2 protons (from O-CH2-) and the vinylic proton on C=CH2.

Wait, perhaps the CH(CH3) proton is coupled to both the O-CH2 protons and the adjacent vinylic proton. So its splitting would be a doublet of doublets, appearing as a dq at around 5.5 ppm.

The vinylic proton (on CH2) would be coupled with the CH(CH3) proton (J=16 Hz), giving a doublet at around 7.0 ppm.

This matches the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), 5.5 ppm (dq from coupling to two different protons), 2.1 ppm (s, OAc CH3), and 1.6 ppm (d, CH3 attached to CH).

So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is a cis or trans configuration?

Wait, in this structure, the substituents on either side of the double bond are:

- On C(CH3): the substituents are the O-CH2 group and the CH3.

- On CH2: the substituents are the double bond and the CH2-O group.

Wait, perhaps the configuration refers to whether the substituents on the double bond are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, the substituents on the double bond (C=CH2) would be:

- On the C side: the CH(CH3) group and the O-CH2 group.

- On the CH2 side: the H and the O-CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the substituents on the double bond (like the O-CH2 and the CH(CH3)) are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans).

If the substituents are on the same side, it's cis; if opposite, trans.

In this structure, the O-CH2 group and the CH(CH3) are on opposite sides, making it trans.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the vinylic protons' coupling is 16 Hz, which is typical for trans coupling. So the substituents are trans.

So the structure would be trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, no. The structure we've considered is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is a butenyl group because there are four carbons (O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenyl group with a substituent. Because propenyl is three carbons, but this structure has four.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but based on the NMR data, the structure seems to have a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond, and the substituents on the double bond are trans, leading to a large J of 16 Hz.

So the options are either propenyl or butenyl. The given options include Trans-propenyl acetate (option B) and Cis-propenyl acetate (option C).

In the structure I considered, the substituents are trans, so it's trans-propenyl acetate, which would be option B.

But wait, the splitting for the CH(CH3) proton is a doublet of quartets, which is a bit more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a triplet due to coupling with two different groups.

But given the time I've spent, I think the answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no. Earlier, I thought the substituents were trans because J was 16. So perhaps the correct answer is Trans-propenyl acetate, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again.

If the substituents are trans, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling constant (J=16 Hz). So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet from one vinylic proton, and the 5.5 ppm is another vinylic proton, which is coupled to another group.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the two substituents (like OAc and another group) are on opposite sides, leading to the vinylic protons being trans, giving a larger J.

So the 7.0 ppm is one vinylic proton, and 5.5 is another, each with their own coupling.

The presence of the methyl group as a doublet suggests it's attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the double bond.

Thus, the structure is trans-propenyl acetate, making option B the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given 1H NMR data is analyzed to identify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The key observations and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Chemical Shifts and Peaks**:
   - **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This peak corresponds to a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), typical of trans coupling across a double bond.
   - **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This peak corresponds to another vinylic proton, which is coupled to two different sets of protons, likely the adjacent vinylic proton (J ≈ 16 Hz) and a proton on an adjacent CH group.
   - **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This is the singlet for the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the carbonyl in the acetate ester.
   - **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This is a doublet for a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to a double bond.

2. **Structural Analysis**:
   - The compound is an acetate ester, with the general structure CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. The NMR data suggests the presence of a double bond, as evidenced by the vinylic protons at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm.
   - The splitting patterns and coupling constants indicate that the double bond is part of a propenyl group (three carbons). The trans configuration is supported by the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) between the two vinylic protons, which is typical for trans coupling across a double bond.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Cis-butenyl acetate (A)**: This structure has a butenyl group (four carbons) with a double bond and substituents on the same side. However, the NMR data does not support a butenyl group, as the splitting patterns and chemical shifts are consistent with a propenyl group.
   - **Trans-propenyl acetate (B)**: This structure has a propenyl group (three carbons) with a double bond and substituents on opposite sides. The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and the observed splitting patterns match this configuration.
   - **Cis-propenyl acetate (C)**: This structure has a propenyl group with substituents on the same side. The smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 12 Hz) for cis coupling does not match the observed J = 16 Hz.
   - **Trans-butenyl acetate (D)**: This structure has a butenyl group with a double bond and substituents on opposite sides. Similar to option A, the NMR data does not support a butenyl group.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-propenyl acetate**, as it explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), the splitting patterns, and the presence of a propenyl group.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me see. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all types of propenyl or butenyl acetates—either cis or trans. Hmm, I remember that the configuration (cis or trans) affects the NMR signals, especially the splitting patterns and coupling constants.

The given NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I need to figure out what each peak corresponds to. Let me break this down.

First, acetates typically have an ester group, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, acetate is an ester from acetic acid, so it's more like R-O-CO-CH3. Wait, no: the structure is R-O-CO-O-CH3? Wait no, no. Acetate esters are R-O-CO-OCH3? Or is it R-O-CO-R', but wait, no. Let me correct that. An acetate ester is formed from acetic acid, so it's R-O-CO-CH3. So the general structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the ester group would be O-CO-O... Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ester functional group is O-CO-O, but in an acetate, the R group is from the acid, which is acetic acid. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the structure would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

So the options are about propenyl and butenyl groups attached to the oxygen. So the structure is something like CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2... or with double bonds.

Wait, no. Let me think. The options are propenyl acetate and butenyl acetate. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2 for propenyl acetate, but the position of the substituents (like where the double bond is) affects the NMR.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- attached to O. So propenyl groups have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, like CH2=CHCH2-O-.

But the question is about whether the substituents (like the ester group) are cis or trans relative to the double bond. So in the case of propenyl acetate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

But wait, when the substituents are on either end of the double bond, their configuration (cis or trans) affects the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the configuration of the substituents around the double bond in the propenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, the double bond is between the two middle carbons, leading to different splitting patterns.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on either side of the double bond are the acetate group and the other two substituents. Let me think. For example, in cis-propenyl acetate, the substituents on either end of the double bond (like the oxygen from the ester and the two CH2 groups) would be on the same side. Similarly, for trans, they would be opposite.

But wait, perhaps the actual structure is more like CH2CH2CH2-O-acetyl, but with a double bond in the propenyl group. So, for example, CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3? Or perhaps the propenyl group is part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR is showing the splitting patterns due to coupling between protons on adjacent carbons, especially around the double bond.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz). A doublet with a large coupling constant (16 Hz) suggests that this proton is coupled to one other proton, perhaps through a double bond. Maybe it's a vinylic proton.

- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). This is a doublet of quadruplets? Wait, no, 'dq' probably means doublet of quartets. Or maybe it's a doublet with some additional splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of doublets. Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, in the data, it's written as 5.5 (1H, dq). So 'dq' could mean doublet of quadruplets, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps it's a doublet of doublets, but that would be written as dd. Hmm, maybe the correct term is 'dq' for a doublet with another splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet and a quartet, but that's not standard notation. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets—so two different coupling constants.

Wait, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps I should focus on the other parts of the spectrum.

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is likely the methyl group from the acetate, since the acetate ester has a -O-CO-CH3 group. The singlet means no adjacent protons, which fits the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 or CH group. Because a doublet means coupling to one proton. So perhaps this methyl is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH group. Alternatively, if it's a CH2CH3 group, but that might produce a triplet. Wait, let me think. If a methyl group (CH3) is attached to a CH group (like CH2CH3), then the CH3 would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But here the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so perhaps the methyl is attached to a CH group that has only one adjacent proton. Hmm, maybe it's in a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-. Then, the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond would be split in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe it's a butenyl group, which would have four carbons in the chain, with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. Let me list them:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: the structure would have the substituents (like the OAc group and the other two substituents) on the same side of the double bond.

2. Trans-propenyl acetate: substituents on opposite sides.

3. Cis-butenyl acetate: similar, but with a four-carbon chain and a double bond.

4. Trans-butenyl acetate: substituents opposite each other on the butenyl group.

Wait, but butenyl could have the double bond between C1 and C2 (1,2-double bond) or between C2 and C3 (2,3). I think in propenyl, it's a three-carbon group with a double bond between C1 and C2. For butenyl, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3 (since propenyl is three carbons, so butenyl would have four, but the position of the double bond varies the structure.

But perhaps I should think about the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which is typical for coupling between two vinylic protons. So maybe these are the two protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond, but in this case, it's a doublet, so perhaps one of them is coupled to another.

Wait, a doublet for a proton suggests that it's coupled to one other proton. So in a double bond, each vinylic proton is typically coupled to two others, unless it's a trans configuration. Wait, no, each proton is coupled to the adjacent proton on the same carbon chain.

Wait, let me think. For a structure like CH2=CHCH2-O-Ac, the protons on the CH2=CH group would be split into a doublet of doublets, but perhaps in this case, it's a doublet because of coupling to another proton elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2OAc but with a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something else.

Wait, let me try to visualize the possible structures.

Option C is cis-propenyl acetate. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that would make the ester group OAc attached to the CH2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Now, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group.

Now, the H on C2 would be next to the double bond. Let me think about their splitting.

In this structure, the CH2 group adjacent to the OAc would have protons. Let's say the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... No, perhaps it's more about the propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe it's an allyl ester. So the ester oxygen is attached to a propenyl group. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the middle carbons. So CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that's the structure for propenyl acetate. Now, in the NMR, the vinylic protons would show specific splitting.

In such a structure, the protons on the CH2 and CH=CH2 would be as follows:

The CH2 group (the one attached to the OAc) would have two protons (let's say as a triplet because adjacent to a CH2 group), but wait, no. The CH2 group attached to O would be next to a CH (if the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond). Wait, no, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So O-CH2-CH2-CH2- would have a double bond between the first and second carbons, making it CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, that's not correct. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the O is attached to the CH2, which is attached to CH=CH2.

In that case, the protons on the CH2 (attached to O) would be next to the CH group (which is part of the double bond). So the CH2-O would have two protons, which are adjacent to the CH which is attached to the double bond.

So the protons on CH2-O would split into a triplet because each is adjacent to the CH (which has two protons, but wait, no. The CH (attached to the double bond) has one proton? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the middle CH would have two protons? No, wait: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc would have the structure where the CH2 is the first carbon, then the CH is the second carbon (double bond between C1 and C2), and the third carbon is CH2 attached to OAc.

Wait, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, that's butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which is propenyl acetate.

In that structure, the propenyl group is CH2-CH=CH2 attached to O. So the first CH2 is attached to O, then the next CH is double bonded to CH2.

Wait, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the CH2 is attached to O, then the next CH is connected via a double bond to the CH2.

So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Now, for the NMR, the vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH2 group.

The protons on the CH=CH2 would couple with each other. So each of the two protons on the double bond would be a doublet because each is coupled to the other. So in the NMR, each would show as a doublet with J around 16 Hz, which is typical for trans coupling.

Wait, but in the given data, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. So that fits with two vinylic protons coupled to each other.

But wait, in the data, there's a peak at 7.0 ppm (1H, d) and another at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). That suggests two different vinylic protons, each coupling with others.

Let me think: the CH2=CH- group would have two protons, each coupled to each other. So each would be a doublet. But in the data, there's only one peak at 7.0 ppm (1H, d) and another at 5.5 ppm (1H, something else).

Hmm, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl but butenyl. Let's think about butenyl acetate.

Butenyl could be either 1,2-diene or 2,3-diene. For butenyl acetate, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, but butenyl groups have four carbons. So for example, OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's 3-pentenyl or something. Hmm, perhaps butenyl is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, maybe another approach. The 2.1 ppm singlet is the acetate methyl. The 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps in a CH2CH3 group. But wait, if it's a CH2CH3, the CH3 would be a triplet. So maybe it's a CH group where the CH has a methyl attached.

Wait, another possibility: the 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2 or CH group.

But perhaps I should consider the coupling in the vinylic region.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a large J (16 Hz), which is typical for trans coupling between two vinylic protons.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a dq, which suggests maybe a doublet of doublets or some other splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling with two different sets of protons.

Wait, maybe the structure has more than two vinylic protons. But in propenyl, there are two vinylic protons. In butenyl, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, then perhaps the structure has two vinylic protons as well. Let me think about 2-butenyl acetate. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc. Hmm, but then the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2. No, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw it.

Butenyl group: four carbons. If the double bond is between C2 and C3, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's not possible because butenyl is an alkyl chain attached to the oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. In that case, the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me think again about the NMR data.

The presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H suggests it's a methyl group not adjacent to any protons, which fits the acetate's methyl.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH or CH2 group. So perhaps the structure has a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. No, but the doublet is for a CH3.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm doublet could be a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2. But in that case, the coupling would lead to a triplet. So that's not matching. So perhaps it's a methyl on a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would make the CH2 group attached to the O, then a CH group with a methyl and a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the C3 has a methyl group attached.

In that case, the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. The protons on C2 would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) group, which would have a proton. So the proton on C2 would couple with the proton on C1 (J=16 Hz), and also with the proton on C3 (maybe a smaller coupling).

Wait, but in that case, the proton on C2 would be split into a doublet of doublets, perhaps. So in the NMR, it might appear as a doublet of doublets or a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps focusing on the number of protons in each signal. The 7.0 ppm (1H, d) suggests one proton, and the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests another. So perhaps the structure has only two vinylic protons, each giving a different signal.

In propenyl groups, there are two vinylic protons. So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. In this structure, the CH2 is attached to O, then the CH=CH2 is attached.

So the vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH2 part. Let's split this into the two protons on the double bond.

In a trans configuration (trans-propenyl acetate), the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. Each would couple with the other, giving a doublet each. But in the data, we have two different peaks for the vinylic region: one at 7.0 ppm (d) and another at 5.5 ppm (dq).

Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinylic protons is also coupled to another group, like the adjacent CH2. Let me think: for the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 group (attached to O) is adjacent to the CH=CH2 group. So the CH2 protons would be next to the CH which is part of the double bond.

So the CH2-O would have protons that are adjacent to the CH=CH2. So each proton on CH2-O would be split by the adjacent CH protons. But the CH=CH2 has two protons, each with a coupling J of about 16 Hz between them.

Wait, but the data shows that the vinylic protons are at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. So perhaps the two vinylic protons are in different environments.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, so they would be equivalent due to symmetry, giving a single doublet. But in the data, they're at two different ppm values. That suggests they're in different environments, which would happen in the cis case.

Wait, no. If the substituents are cis, then the two vinylic protons are on the same side. But how would that affect their chemical shifts?

Wait, for example, in cis-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons are on the same side as the OAc group. So one of them (the one on the same carbon as the OAc) would be deshielded more, appearing at a higher ppm, while the other would be more shielded, appearing at a lower ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of diastereotopic protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure has an additional substituent that causes the two vinylic protons to be non-equivalent. For example, if one of the vinylic protons is adjacent to a CH2 group and the other is adjacent to a CH group with a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2. No, but then the substituents would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the CH2 is attached to O, then a CH(CH3) attached to a double bond.

In that case, the double bond is between the CH(CH3) and the CH2. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 of the double bond. Wait, no, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the CH2 is attached to O, then the C(CH3) is attached via a double bond to CH2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me sketch it:

OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

So the C(CH3) is connected via a double bond to the CH2 group. So the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 part. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-C=CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the other peaks. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, a proton that's adjacent to a CH2 group and also adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the splitting pattern can tell us about the structure. The doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz suggests a proton coupled to another vinylic proton. The other vinylic proton is at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets or doublet of doublets.

In the case of cis-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons are on the same side, so they might be next to each other and couple with each other and perhaps with adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a proton that's coupled to two different adjacent protons, causing a more complex splitting.

Wait, considering the options again. The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So let's think about each option and their expected NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the substituents (OAc and the other groups) on the same side of the double bond.

In this case, the two vinylic protons (on CH=CH2) would be in different environments because one is adjacent to the CH2-O and the other is at the end. So their chemical shifts would be different.

So the proton next to the OAc (on the CH2) would couple with the double bond proton, and perhaps with the adjacent CH2. Wait, but the CH2 is attached to O, so the two protons on CH2 would be next to the CH=CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the OAc is on the CH2, which is attached to the CH=CH2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH group. The CH2=CH would have two protons. The CH2 (attached to O) has two protons, and the CH (from CH2=CH) has two protons.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is as follows: the protons on the CH2=CH would couple with each other (J=16 Hz), and the CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH protons.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, and 5.5 is a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is one vinylic proton, and the 5.5 is another, each with different coupling.

Wait, let's consider the coupling between the CH2-O and the CH=CH2 group.

The CH2-O has two protons, each adjacent to the CH which is part of the double bond. So each of these CH2 protons would be split by the adjacent CH protons.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the trans and cis configurations.

In a trans configuration, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, which could mean that their coupling is larger (maybe around 16 Hz). In the cis case, the coupling might be similar, but their chemical environments could be different.

In the data, the 7.0 ppm doublet and 5.5 ppm dq suggest two different vinylic protons, which implies that the substituents around the double bond are different on each side. This would happen in a cis configuration because one side has the OAc group and the other has a different substituent, like a CH2.

So in cis-propenyl acetate, one vinylic proton is next to the OAc group, and the other is next to the CH2 group. That would make their chemical shifts different, as their environments are different.

So for the vinylic protons:

- The proton closer to OAc (the CH2 attached to O) would experience a different environment than the one on the other end. So their chemical shifts would be different.

The 7.0 ppm peak could be the more deshielded proton (next to the OAc), and the 5.5 ppm peak could be the other.

Additionally, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps this is the CH(CH3) group in the structure. Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Unless there's another substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure has a methyl branch. For example, OAc-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2. No, but that doesn't fit with the propenyl.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to a double bond. So the structure could be OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the C(CH3) would have a methyl group attached, and the double bond would be between C(CH3) and CH2.

So the vinylic protons would be on the CH2 part of the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm methyl is part of a CH2CH3 group, but that would usually give a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't include a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is part of a substituent on the double bond. Like OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that again doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere, making it butenyl.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the butenyl options.

If the structure is butenyl acetate, the double bond could be between C2 and C3. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on the CH=CH2 group. The CH2 groups are attached to O and the double bond.

The protons on the CH2-O would be adjacent to the CH2, which is adjacent to the double bond. So their splitting would be influenced by the adjacent CH2 and the double bond.

The vinylic protons would be a doublet each, but perhaps in the case of cis or trans, their chemical shifts would differ.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex due to coupling with adjacent groups.

But perhaps the presence of a methyl group at 1.6 ppm suggests that there's a methyl substituent somewhere, possibly on a CH group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm methyl is part of a geminal group, like OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me try a different approach: the coupling constants.

The J value of 16 Hz in the 7.0 ppm doublet suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic protons. So perhaps the substituents on either side of the double bond are trans, leading to a large J.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the substituents (like OAc and the adjacent CH2) are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the two vinylic protons would be trans to each other, giving a larger J.

But how does that affect the NMR signals?

In trans-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons would be in different environments. For example, one is next to the OAc group, and the other is next to the CH2 group. So their chemical shifts would be different, leading to two separate signals: one at 7.0 ppm (d) and another at 5.5 ppm (dq).

The dq at 5.5 ppm could be due to coupling with two different protons. For example, the proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to both the other vinylic proton (J=16 Hz) and perhaps a neighboring CH2 group's proton (smaller J).

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a proton that's adjacent to both the double bond and another group, leading to more splitting.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH or CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm methyl could be part of a CH2 group attached to a CH that's part of the double bond. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but again, without a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is part of a substituent on the double bond. For example, OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)=CH2. In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH(CH2CH3) is on C2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons would be on C3 (the CH2 part). The CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton that's adjacent to the double bond, which would couple with the vinylic proton.

So the vinylic proton (on C3) would couple with the adjacent CH(CH2CH3) proton, leading to a doublet. Additionally, it might couple with another proton elsewhere.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm methyl is part of a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. For example, OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but again, without a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 would have a double bond between C3 and C4, making it OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that would be a butenyl group.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on C3 and C4. The C4 would have a CH2 group, perhaps with a methyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the CH(CH3) is on C3, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. The vinylic protons would be on C4 (CH2) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

But the C4 would have a CH2 group, so the protons there would be a triplet or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the C2 being CH2 attached to O, and C3 being C(CH3)=CH2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons would be on C3 and C4. The C(CH3)=CH2 would have a vinylic proton on C4, and the C3 would have a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the protons on the double bond are on C3 and C4. So the structure would have OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the vinylic proton on C4 would be a doublet (coupled with the C3 proton), and the C3 proton would be a doublet as well. But the C3 has a CH(CH3) group, so perhaps the C3 proton is split into a doublet of doublets because it's coupled with both the C4 vinylic proton and the adjacent CH2 group's protons.

So the vinylic proton at C4 would be a doublet at around 7.0 ppm due to coupling with C3's proton (J=16 Hz). The C3 proton would be a doublet of doublets (because it's coupled to C4 and to the adjacent CH2's protons), which might appear around 5.5 ppm as a dq.

This would match the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), 5.5 ppm (dq), and the methyl groups at 2.1 (s) and 1.6 (d).

Wait, but where does the 1.6 ppm doublet come from? The CH(CH3) group would have a proton, but it's a CH, not a CH3. So the 1.6 ppm could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but in the structure OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, the C(CH3) has a methyl group. The CH2 group attached to O would have two protons. The C(CH3) would have a proton that's adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but the methyl group itself (CH3) would be attached to the C(CH3), which is part of the double bond. So the methyl group would be a singlet? No, because the C(CH3) is attached to the double bond, which is a sp2 hybridized carbon. So the methyl group's protons would be split based on their coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, no, the methyl group (CH3) is attached to a sp3 carbon (the C(CH3)), which is connected to the double bond. So the methyl group's protons are on a CH3, which is attached to a CH, which is part of the double bond.

But the CH3 would be a singlet only if it's not adjacent to any protons. Wait, no, being adjacent to a CH would cause splitting. So the CH3 would be a singlet? Or a doublet?

Wait, the CH3 is attached to a CH (which is part of the double bond). The CH has one proton. So the CH3 would be split into a doublet because each of its protons is coupled with the adjacent CH's proton.

But in reality, the CH3 would be a septet if adjacent to a CH2, but here it's adjacent to a CH. So each proton in CH3 would couple with the single proton on CH, leading to a doublet for the CH3. But that would be a triplet for the CH3, because each CH3 proton is coupled with the single CH proton.

Wait, no. The splitting of the CH3 group depends on how many neighbors it has. If the CH3 is attached to a CH group (which has one proton), then the CH3 would be a doublet. Because each CH3 proton is coupled with the single proton on the adjacent CH.

But in the NMR data, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H, d), which would fit this scenario: the CH3 is split into a doublet by the adjacent CH proton.

So putting it all together:

The structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

The NMR would show:

- The acetate methyl (OAc's CH3): 2.1 ppm, singlet (3H).

- The CH2-O group's protons: adjacent to the CH(CH3), so their protons would be split into a triplet or some other pattern. But in the data, the 1.6 ppm is the CH3, not the CH2.

Wait, the CH2-O group's protons would be on the CH2 next to the CH(CH3). So each of these two protons would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) proton, leading to a triplet for each. But since they're on a CH2, their splitting would be a quartet? No, wait, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH with one proton. Each proton on CH2 would be split into a doublet of doublets, but since there are two equivalent protons, it would appear as a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group (O-CH2-) is adjacent to the CH(CH3)=CH2 group. So the two protons on the CH2 would each be coupled to the adjacent CH's proton. So each would be a doublet, but since there are two equivalent protons, their combined splitting would be a triplet.

But in the data given, the CH2 protons aren't mentioned. Wait, perhaps the CH2 is a triplet, but it's not in the given data. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 protons are at a lower ppm and not mentioned, but the given data only shows the vinylic and methyl groups.

But in the given data, the 1.6 ppm is the CH3 (doublet), and the 5.5 ppm is the CH(CH3) proton, which is a doublet of doublets.

So the structure would be:

OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this structure:

- The CH3 on the C(CH3) is a doublet (coupled with the adjacent CH proton).

- The CH proton on C(CH3) is coupled with both the adjacent CH2 protons (from O-CH2-) and the vinylic proton on C=CH2.

Wait, perhaps the CH(CH3) proton is coupled to both the O-CH2 protons and the adjacent vinylic proton. So its splitting would be a doublet of doublets, appearing as a dq at around 5.5 ppm.

The vinylic proton (on CH2) would be coupled with the CH(CH3) proton (J=16 Hz), giving a doublet at around 7.0 ppm.

This matches the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), 5.5 ppm (dq from coupling to two different protons), 2.1 ppm (s, OAc CH3), and 1.6 ppm (d, CH3 attached to CH).

So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is a cis or trans configuration?

Wait, in this structure, the substituents on either side of the double bond are:

- On C(CH3): the substituents are the O-CH2 group and the CH3.

- On CH2: the substituents are the double bond and the CH2-O group.

Wait, perhaps the configuration refers to whether the substituents on the double bond are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, the substituents on the double bond (C=CH2) would be:

- On the C side: the CH(CH3) group and the O-CH2 group.

- On the CH2 side: the H and the O-CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the substituents on the double bond (like the O-CH2 and the CH(CH3)) are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans).

If the substituents are on the same side, it's cis; if opposite, trans.

In this structure, the O-CH2 group and the CH(CH3) are on opposite sides, making it trans.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the vinylic protons' coupling is 16 Hz, which is typical for trans coupling. So the substituents are trans.

So the structure would be trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, no. The structure we've considered is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is a butenyl group because there are four carbons (O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenyl group with a substituent. Because propenyl is three carbons, but this structure has four.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but based on the NMR data, the structure seems to have a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond, and the substituents on the double bond are trans, leading to a large J of 16 Hz.

So the options are either propenyl or butenyl. The given options include Trans-propenyl acetate (option B) and Cis-propenyl acetate (option C).

In the structure I considered, the substituents are trans, so it's trans-propenyl acetate, which would be option B.

But wait, the splitting for the CH(CH3) proton is a doublet of quartets, which is a bit more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a triplet due to coupling with two different groups.

But given the time I've spent, I think the answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no. Earlier, I thought the substituents were trans because J was 16. So perhaps the correct answer is Trans-propenyl acetate, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again.

If the substituents are trans, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling constant (J=16 Hz). So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet from one vinylic proton, and the 5.5 ppm is another vinylic proton, which is coupled to another group.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the two substituents (like OAc and another group) are on opposite sides, leading to the vinylic protons being trans, giving a larger J.

So the 7.0 ppm is one vinylic proton, and 5.5 is another, each with their own coupling.

The presence of the methyl group as a doublet suggests it's attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the double bond.

Thus, the structure is trans-propenyl acetate, making option B the correct answer.


The given 1H NMR data is analyzed to identify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The key observations and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Chemical Shifts and Peaks**:
   - **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This peak corresponds to a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), typical of trans coupling across a double bond.
   - **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This peak corresponds to another vinylic proton, which is coupled to two different sets of protons, likely the adjacent vinylic proton (J ≈ 16 Hz) and a proton on an adjacent CH group.
   - **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This is the singlet for the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the carbonyl in the acetate ester.
   - **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This is a doublet for a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to a double bond.

2. **Structural Analysis**:
   - The compound is an acetate ester, with the general structure CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. The NMR data suggests the presence of a double bond, as evidenced by the vinylic protons at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm.
   - The splitting patterns and coupling constants indicate that the double bond is part of a propenyl group (three carbons). The trans configuration is supported by the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) between the two vinylic protons, which is typical for trans coupling across a double bond.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Cis-butenyl acetate (A)**: This structure has a butenyl group (four carbons) with a double bond and substituents on the same side. However, the NMR data does not support a butenyl group, as the splitting patterns and chemical shifts are consistent with a propenyl group.
   - **Trans-propenyl acetate (B)**: This structure has a propenyl group (three carbons) with a double bond and substituents on opposite sides. The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and the observed splitting patterns match this configuration.
   - **Cis-propenyl acetate (C)**: This structure has a propenyl group with substituents on the same side. The smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 12 Hz) for cis coupling does not match the observed J = 16 Hz.
   - **Trans-butenyl acetate (D)**: This structure has a butenyl group with a double bond and substituents on opposite sides. Similar to option A, the NMR data does not support a butenyl group.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-propenyl acetate**, as it explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), the splitting patterns, and the presence of a propenyl group.

Answer: B
