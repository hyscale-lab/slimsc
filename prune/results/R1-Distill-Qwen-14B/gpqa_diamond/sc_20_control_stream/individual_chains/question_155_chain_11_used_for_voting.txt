Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for a system that's in a specific state. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So in this case, A is P_z. That means I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Wait, but the state is explicitly given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. 

But the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That's important because it affects how we compute expectation values.

Now, the matrix for P_z is given. Let me write that down. P_z matrix is:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z, which makes sense because in this basis, the matrix is diagonal. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the three basis states.

Wait, the state |ψ> is in this basis, right? So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can just take the expectation value directly. Since the state is |ψ> = [a, b, c]^T, then ⟨P_z⟩ is a*(ħ)*a* + b*0*b + c*(-ħ)*c*. 

Wait, no, more accurately, for each component, we have the eigenvalue as per the P_z matrix. So each component i in the state vector corresponds to the eigenvalue in the i-th diagonal element of P_z.

So for |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T, each component corresponds to the eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be sum_{i} |ψ_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i). Let's compute each term:

First component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ
Second component: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0
Third component: (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = - ħ/4

Adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 - (1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. Because the first and third terms cancel each other out. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z² would be:
[ (ħ)^2   0        0     ]
[ 0       0^2     0     ]
[ 0       0       (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:
[ ħ²   0    0 ]
[ 0    0    0 ]
[ 0    0   ħ² ]

So when I compute ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the sum of |ψ_i|^2 times (eigenvalue_i squared).

Let's compute each term:

First component: (1/4) * ħ²
Second component: (1/2) * 0² = 0
Third component: (1/4) * ħ²

Adding them: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). We have ⟨P_z²⟩ as (1/2) ħ² and ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ squared is zero. So uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of ⟨P_z²⟩. Let me go through it again.

Each component gives:

(ψ₁^2) * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ²
(ψ₂^2) * 0 = 0
(ψ₃^2) * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ²
Total: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². Yep, correct.

So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). Looking at the options, that's option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 \cdot \text{(eigenvalue of $P_z$ for component $i$)}.
\]

- For the first component: $|\psi_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue is $\hbar$, so the contribution is $(1/4)\hbar$.
- For the second component: $|\psi_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and the eigenvalue is $0$, so the contribution is $0$.
- For the third component: $|\psi_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue is $-\hbar$, so the contribution is $(1/4)(-\hbar)$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (1/4)\hbar + 0 - (1/4)\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, so its matrix is:

\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 \cdot \text{(eigenvalue of $P_z^2$ for component $i$)}.
\]

- For the first component: $|\psi_1|^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue is $\hbar^2$, so the contribution is $(1/4)\hbar^2$.
- For the second component: $|\psi_2|^2 = 1/2$, and the eigenvalue is $0$, so the contribution is $0$.
- For the third component: $|\psi_3|^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue is $\hbar^2$, so the contribution is $(1/4)\hbar^2$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4)\hbar^2 + 0 + (1/4)\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
