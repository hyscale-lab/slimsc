Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester group absorption. Ester groups have strong peaks around 1740 cm^-1, I think. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group, which is usually -COO- something.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has six signals. Let me break that down. Two signals for aromatic-H. Wait, di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. For example, if it's para, there are two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. But if it's ortho, maybe more splitting, or if it's meta, perhaps a different pattern. But the question says two signals for aromatic-H, so maybe each is a doublet, which would happen in para substitution. Or maybe one is a singlet and the other a doublet? Hmm, not sure yet.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH or similar. The question says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Wait, vinyl protons are typically split by adjacent protons. So maybe it's a trans configuration, where the protons are on opposite sides. For example, in an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Or perhaps in a conjugated system.

Wait, the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R? No, esters are RCOOR'. So in this case, maybe the ester is attached to the aromatic ring. So if the substituents are an ester and another group.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. One of them is an ester group. Let me think about the structure.

So the substituents could be an ester group and something else. Like maybe an OCOOR group attached to the ring, and another substituent.

Wait, another possibility is that one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group. Or perhaps both substituents are ester-related. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So maybe each substituent is a vinyl group? Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else.

Wait, the ester group in the aromatic ring. Let me think about the structure. For example, maybe the ring has an ester substituent, like OCOOR, and another substituent which is a vinyl group, like CH2CH2 attached.

Wait, but looking at the NMR signals: two vinyl protons. So maybe each substituent has a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, maybe it's a structure where the ester is part of a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, leading to -O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So maybe the substituent is a group with two vinyl protons. Like, perhaps a substituted vinyl group. For example, maybe it's a substituent like CH2CH2-O-CO-R, but that might not fit.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. One vinyl proton is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet would suggest one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is more complex. Quartet suggests coupling with two protons, but in this case, it's a doublet of quartets, meaning each proton is split into quartets, but then each of those is split into a doublet. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to another group with two protons.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are each an ester and a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O connected to a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methylenedioxy group. No, that's more for another type of coupling.

Alternatively, think about the vinyl group being part of a side chain. Let me imagine a structure where the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -COOCH3 or similar) and the other is a vinyl group attached as a substituent, perhaps as an ethenyl group (CH2=CH-).

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-..., maybe that's a possibility. Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl ester, for example, something like Ph-COOCH2CH2-... but that may not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group. Hmm, but that would have more protons.

Wait, another option: the substituent is a styryl group, which is a benzene ring with a vinyl substituent. But in this case, the di-substituted ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester, and the other a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester linked to a vinyl group. For example, the structure could be something like benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group attached directly (like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituents are both ester groups. But that would make it a di-ester, but I'm not sure how that would affect the NMR.

Wait, looking back at the NMR: six signals. Two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3 groups. So maybe the substituents are such that each brings certain protons.

Wait, for the substituent with the ester group, perhaps it's a group like -O-CO-CH2CH3. No, that would have CH2 groups, but the NMR says no signals for CH2. Hmm, the NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. So maybe two methyl groups in the molecule.

Wait, let's consider the possible structures. The di-substituted benzene has an ester group and another group that has a vinyl and methyl groups. For example, the other substituent could be a vinyl group attached to an ester, like -CH2-COO-R or something else.

Alternatively, think about the vinyl group being part of a propenoate ester. For instance, the substituent could be an allyl ester, like -O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe a prop-1-enyl ester, -O-CO-CH2CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an ester. For example, the substituent is -COOCH2CH2- but that would have a CH2 group, which isn't present in the NMR. So the CH2 groups are not present, according to the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So the molecule has two different methyl groups. That suggests perhaps two different methyl substituents, but not connected through CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group. But if it's an ester, then perhaps it's connected via an oxygen. Like, maybe the substituent is a methoxy carbonyl group (O-CO-OCH3), but that wouldn't make sense. Or maybe it's a methyl ester, like -COOCH3.

Wait, but considering substituents on the benzene, let's think about the structure as benzene with two groups attached: one is an ester (like -COOR) and the other is a vinyl group attached with a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and the other is an ester. But then the NMR would show more signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both ester groups but with different R groups.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. The aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's assume one is an ester group, -COOR, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps as a side chain.

Wait, the vinyl group would have adjacent protons. So, in the NMR, a vinyl proton would couple with its adjacent proton. So for a simple vinyl group (CH2=CH-), the protons would be a doublet each, but in the case of a trans configuration, maybe a doublet of quartets?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about the possible structures more clearly.

The ester group would contribute the carbonyl peak in IR and the COOCH3 or similar in NMR. But the NMR doesn't show any signals for CH2 groups, which suggests that any CH2 groups in the structure are either not present or are in equivalent environments.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So perhaps two methyl groups are present, and they are not equivalent. So maybe one is part of an ester group (like R-O-CO-OCH3) and another is somewhere else.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH3, but then that would be a methoxy group. But the IR would show a strong peak for ester, not for ether.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the ring, but that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl group attached via an ester. No, that would complicate the structure.

Hmm. Perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an ester. For example, the structure could be benzene with a substituent like -COOCH2CH2CH3, but that has a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, so any CH2 groups must be in a symmetric or equivalent environment, or perhaps they're not present. So perhaps the substituent has no CH2 groups.

Wait, another idea: the substituent is an allyl ester. For example, the substituent could be -O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-, but that again has CH2 groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group connected via an ester. So, for instance, one substituent is -COOCH3 (methyl ester), and the other substituent is a vinyl group. So benzene with -COOCH3 and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, but the vinyl group would have its own protons. Let's think about that structure.

The benzene ring has two substituents: one is -COOCH3, and the other is a vinyl group, like -CH2CH2-, but that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, the vinyl group is directly attached, like -CH2-CH2- but as a substituent, that would be a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring, but that's an ethenyl group, not a CH2CH2. Wait, ethenyl is CH2=CH-.

Hmm, so if the substituent is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, that would have CH2 groups. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So perhaps the substituent is not an ethyl group, but a methyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So maybe one is the methyl from the ester, and another is a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: determine the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

So the di-substituted benzene is C6H4. If each substituent adds certain groups.

Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

For C11H12O2: Degrees of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOx; DoU = (2n +2 - m - x)/2.

Wait, the general formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But assuming no halogens or N.

So for C11H12O2:

DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2= 12/2=6.

Each benzene ring is 3 DoU (3 double bonds or equivalent rings). So 6 DoU: benzene (3), ester (1 for the double bond in COOR, and another for the carbonyl), and maybe a double bond elsewhere. Wait, but the aromatic ring is 3, ester is 2 (carbonyl and the ester's O), but I think the ester contributes one DoU, the carbonyl. The vinyl group would add another DoU.

Wait, let's see. Benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1). That's 5. So maybe another ring or double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps a substituent contributes another DoU.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), that adds a DoU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. But the molecule needs 6 DoU, so perhaps another ring or double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ring, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aromatic ring as well, but that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the other substituent is a carbonyl group, but that's part of the ester.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

So the benzene ring is C6H5 (if it's a mono-substituted), but in di-substituted, it's C6H4. So the substituents add (for each substituent) R groups.

The overall formula is, for example, C6H4(R)(R'). So the total formula would be C6 + sum of carbons in R and R' = 11, 12, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C12H12O2.

So 12 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 6 carbons. Each substituent must add 3 carbons on average. So maybe each substituent is a propyl group or similar.

Wait, but substituents could vary. One substituent is an ester group, which would be, say, -COOCH2CH3. That's 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons beyond the O). Wait, COOCH3 is -COOCH3 (ester with methyl group), which is 3 carbons (C from COO and the CH3). Alternatively, COOCH2CH2CH3 would be 5 carbons? No, wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 3 carbons in the ester (COO and the three from the ethyl group? No, wait COOCH2CH2CH3 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So the R group is CH2CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons. So the substituent would be COOCH2CH2CH3, which is 5 carbons (COO has two carbons, and the R has three). Wait, no, COO is two carbons, R is CH2CH2CH3 is three, so substituent adds 5 carbons (2 from COO and 3 from R). But benzene is 6, substituents add 5 each? No, because we have two substituents. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the substituents are two groups attached to the benzene. One is an ester (COOR), which is (COO plus R). So R could be methyl (COOCH3) which is 3 carbons (COOCH3: COO is two, CH3 is one). So substituent adds 3 carbons.

Another substituent could be a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, perhaps. Or another substituent with some carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (COOCH3, 3 carbons) and another group that's a vinyl group attached to a methyl. Wait, that may not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3, 3 carbons), and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl, like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Wait, that would complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl group attached. For example, the substituent is CH2=CHCH3, which is an isopropenyl group. But then, how does that connect to the benzene?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group. Alternatively, a substituent could be -CH2-COOCH3. But that would create a CH2 group, which the NMR says is not present.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider the number of protons in each substituent.

The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic (so maybe para substitution, so equivalent H on each substituent), two vinyl (so maybe two different vinyl protons), two CH3 groups. No CH2 groups.

So the substituents are probably such that they don't have any CH2 groups.

Hmm, so perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached in a way that doesn't include CH2 groups.

Wait, let's imagine the substituents are:

1. -COOCH3 (ester group, which has a methyl)
2. -CH2CH2 (vinyl group, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in NMR)

No, that can't be.

Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, but again, CH2 groups are present.

Alternatively, substituent is -CH2- attached to the ring, but that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group in such a way that there are no CH2 groups. Like, maybe a group like -CH(CH2CH3)=CH2, but that might have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to count the hydrogens.

The formula options have varying H counts. The aromatic ring in di-substituted benzene would normally have 4 H's (if it's para substitution, each substituent is on opposite positions). So for each substituent, depending on their structure, the H count changes.

In the NMR, there are two aromatic signals. So the aromatic protons are probably in two sets, each as a doublet. That suggests a para substitution pattern, where the substituents are opposite each other, leading to two equivalent sets of aromatic H.

So the aromatic H count would be four (two sets of two H each?), but the NMR shows two signals, so each set could be two H each.

Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene, each set would have two H. So two signals, each a doublet. So that fits.

So, the substituents are para to each other.

Now, the substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a group that includes a vinyl group.

So, substituent A: ester group, -COO-R.

Substituent B: vinyl group, perhaps as -CH2-CH2- but that leads to CH2 groups, which are not present. So substituent B must have a vinyl group without CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's not right. Alternatively, substituent B is -CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl group, which would have CH2 groups, but the NMR doesn't show any. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a phenyl group, but that doesn't have any vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, substituent B is a propenyl group, but that might have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl ester. For example, substituent B could be -CH2-COO-R. But that brings more CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let's think about the NMR signals:

- Two aromatic protons (probably four H in two doublets)
- Two vinyl H (so two H each, perhaps)
- Two CH3 groups (so two different methyl groups, each with perhaps three H)

So, the ester group would contribute a methyl group (like OCOCH3), which is one CH3. The other CH3 must be from another source.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a methyl group attached to a vinyl. But if substituent B is a methyl group, then the vinyl would be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to the ring, and substituent A is an ester group that includes a vinyl.

Wait, but where would the vinyl come from then?

Wait, another approach: the substituent with the vinyl group could be part of an ester. For example, substituent A could be a vinyl ester, like -COOCH2CH2CH2- but that brings back CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent A is a propenoate ester: -COOCH2CH2CH3, but again, that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes one CH3. Then substituent B is a group that includes another CH3 and some vinyl protons without any CH2.

Wait, substituent B could be a vinyl group connected to a methyl group via a double bond. Like, -CH2-CH2- but that's not possible without a CH2.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)=CH2. But then the structure would have a CH2 group, which is not present in the NMR.

Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about what that implies.

A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton (n+1 rule, n=1 → doublet). A doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupled with two sets of protons. Maybe each is adjacent to two different protons, or perhaps each is coupled to a group with two protons.

Wait, for example, in a trans double bond, each vinyl proton is adjacent to another proton on the same carbon. But that would usually give a doublet for each.

Alternatively, maybe one proton is adjacent to another group with two protons. For instance, in a structure like CH2CH2-O-CO-R, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a ring structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the ring. For instance, substituent B is -CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, but that would have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's a branch, not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a styryl group (vinyl attached to benzene), and substituent A is an ester.

In that case, substituent B would be a vinyl group attached to the ring, which would lead to two vinyl protons. Let's think about that.

So substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's ethenyl. So the structure would be benzene with -COOCH3 and -CH2CH2- as substituents. But wait, that would have CH2 groups in the substituent, which the NMR doesn't show.

Ah, but wait, the NMR says there are no CH2 groups. So substituent B must not contain any CH2 groups.

So substituent B must be a group with a double bond and no CH2 groups. For example, a methyl group attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, like -CH2-CH2-, but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)-CH2-, but that also has CH2.

Hmm, maybe substituent B is a benzyl group (CH2-C6H5), but that has CH2, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a cyclopropane ring with a double bond, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond. For example, substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's not right. Alternatively, substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's ethenyl.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to the ring without any CH2 groups. Like, substituent B is -CH2-CH2-, but that's ethenyl, which would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the molecular formula options. Let's calculate for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. Benzene (C6) plus substituents giving C5 and H10O2. Wait, substituents are two groups, so the substituents would add up to C5, H10.

But each substituent would need to be a group with certain H.

Option B: C12H14O2. So substituents add C6, H10.

Option C: C12H12O2. Substituents add C6, H8.

Option D: C11H12O2. Substituents add C5, H8.

Wait, the aromatic ring is C6H4 (since di-substituted). So the molecular formula would be C6 + sum of substituents.

So for option D: C11H12O2 → substituents contribute C5H8O2.

Wait, but an ester group is RCOOR'. For example, R could be methyl, R' could be ethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methyl ester, but that would be two substituents, adding two methyl groups and two ester groups. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the number of protons in the molecule.

The NMR shows:

- Aromatic: 4 H (two doublets, each with 2 H)
- Vinyl: 4 H (two signals, each with 2 H)
- CH3: 6 H (two signals, each with 3 H)

So total H from these would be 4 + 4 +6 = 14 H.

But wait, the benzene has four H, substituent H's: but wait, the substituents may have more H.

Wait, substituent A is an ester, which could be, say, -COOCH3. Then the substituent has three H (from CH3). Substituent B is a vinyl group, which has two H per substituent (like ethenyl). So substituent B contributes 2 H. Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals, each with 2 H. So substituent B's vinyl group has two H, each split into doublets or quartets.

Wait, but the benzene has four H, substituent A (ester) has three H (from methyl), substituent B (vinyl) has two H. So the total H would be 4 +3 +2 =9. But the NMR shows 4 (aromatic) +4 (vinyl) +6 (CH3) =14. That can't be right.

Ah, wait, no. Because substituent A (ester) might have more H. For example, if substituent A is -COOCH2CH3, then the substituent would have 3 H (from CH2CH3). Substituent B is a vinyl group with two H. Plus the benzene's four H. So 4 +3 +2=9 H. But the NMR shows 14 H. So perhaps I'm missing some H from the substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent structure is more complex, with more H in the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituents contribute more H. Let me think of substituent A as a larger group.

If substituent A is -COOCH2CH2CH3, then the substituent contributes 3 H (from the methyl end). But that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, back to the NMR signals. The two CH3 groups: perhaps each is a singlet, meaning no neighboring H. So maybe they're attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

So, for example, one methyl is part of an ester group (like OCOCH3), and another methyl is part of another group, perhaps a methoxy group. But wait, the IR suggests an ester, not an ether. So methoxy would show a different peak.

Alternatively, the two CH3 groups are each attached to carbonyl groups, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl vinyl ester attached to the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-COOCH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-COOCH3. No, again CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached via a double bond. For example, substituent B is -CH2-CH2-, but that's ethenyl.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula again.

Let me take option C: C12H12O2.

So substituents contribute 6 carbons (since benzene is 6). So each substituent contributes 3 carbons on average.

So substituent A is, say, -COOCH3 (3 carbons), substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like -CH2-CH2-. Wait, but that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent B is a benzyl group, contributing 5 carbons, but that's more than needed.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two CH3 groups, which are likely from two different substituents. So substituent A is an ester, -COOCH3, which contributes one CH3. Substituent B must contribute another CH3, perhaps as a -CH(CH3) group.

Wait, but if substituent B is -CH(CH3)=CH2, that would introduce a vinyl group and a methyl group. Let's count the H:

- Aromatic: 4 H (two doublets)
- Vinyl: substituent B has three H (CH2=CH(CH3) → but that's a CH2 group, which is not present)
Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that each substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -COOCH3 and -CH2CH2, but again, that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Let me try to think about the degrees of unsaturation again.

Taking option C: C12H12O2.

DoU: (2*12 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (26-12)/2=14/2=7.

Benzene contributes 3. Esters contribute 2 (the carbonyl and the ester O). Vinyl group contributes 1. So 3+2+1=6. Need one more DoU, which could come from another ring or double bond. But I'm not sure where.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a ring. But that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a methyl ester (COOCH3) and substituent B is a benzyl group (CH2-C6H5). But that adds another benzene, which isn't indicated.

Alternatively, substituent B is a cyclopropane ring, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: the substituent with the vinyl group could be a propenyl group, adding a double bond.

In that case, substituent B is -CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond somewhere, but that brings CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that's again with CH2.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to look for the answer based on the number of CH3 groups and absence of CH2.

Since the NMR shows two CH3 groups, perhaps the formula has two methyl groups. Looking at the options:

Option D: C11H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 6.

Option C: C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 7.

Which option would fit better with the NMR data?

The NMR has no CH2 groups, so the substituents must not have any. So substituents must either be a methyl group or a group without CH2.

If substituent A is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes a methyl group, and substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, that would require another methyl. But how?

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that brings CH2 groups.

Wait, another angle: the ester group is part of a vinyl group.

For example, the substituent is -CH2-COOCH3. So attached to the ring is a CH2 group connected to a COOCH3. But that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propenoate ester, like -CH2CH2COOCH3, but that has CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ester oxygen. For example, substituent A is -O-CO-CH2-CH2-, but that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

The correct answer must have the correct number of H's according to the NMR.

In the NMR, the total protons observed are:

Aromatic: 4 (two signals, 2 H each)
Vinyl: 4 (two signals, 2 H each)
CH3: 6 (two signals, 3 H each)

Total: 14 H.

So the molecular formula must have 14 H.

Looking at the options:

A) C11H14O2 → 14 H. So matches.
B) C12H14O2 → 14 H.
C) C12H12O2 → 12 H. Doesn't match.
D) C11H12O2 → 12 H. Doesn't match.

So options A and B have 14 H. So the correct answer must be either A or B.

Now, the molecular formula for A is C11H14O2. Degrees of unsaturation:

DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. That adds up. So DoU is satisfied.

Option B: C12H14O2.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) + another DoU. So perhaps a ring or another double bond.

But the substituents may not add another DoU, unless there's a ring or another double bond elsewhere.

But how does that fit with the NMR?

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups, so the formula must have two methyl groups, each contributing 3 H. So in the formula, the number of methyl groups must be two.

For option A: C11H14O2. Let's see how many methyl groups are possible.

If one substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3, which contributes one methyl), then another substituent must have another methyl group.

But the other substituent is a vinyl group. So how can a vinyl group have a methyl group attached without any CH2?

Ah, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)2, but that's not a vinyl group.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond. Like -CH2-CH2- with a double bond? No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)=CH2. That has a vinyl group (the CH2=CH part) and a methyl group (the CH(CH3)). But that substituent would have a CH2 group (the middle CH2), which the NMR doesn't show.

Hmm. Alternatively, substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl attached.

Wait, substituent B could be -CH2-CH2- with a double bond elsewhere, but that brings CH2 groups.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the ester group and the substituents.

If the substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes 3 H (CH3), then the other substituent must be a vinyl group with a methyl attached without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a gem-dimethyl group attached to a vinyl. For example, substituent B is -C(CH3)2=CH2. But that would have two methyl groups attached to the same carbon and a vinyl group. However, that would have a CH2 group (the CH2 at the end of the vinyl), which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond without any CH2 elsewhere. Like -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that has CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent B is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring, but that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl, but without any CH2 groups. For example, substituent B is -CH(CH3)=CH2. But that substituent would have a CH2 group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent structure again. If substituent B is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, that has a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Another thought: perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Like -O-CH(CH3)2. But that would be an ether, and the IR would show an ester, not an ether.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible structure again.

The molecular formula must have 14 H, so options A and B are possible.

Option A: C11H14O2. So substituents contribute 5 carbons (since benzene is 6).

Assuming two substituents, each contributes 2.5 carbons on average. But that's not possible. So one substituent has 3 carbons and the other 2.

For example, substituent A is a methyl ester (3 carbons: COOCH3), and substituent B is a vinyl group with 2 carbons (CH2=CH-). But that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group and a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond. So substituent B would be -CH(CH3)=CH2. But that brings a CH2 group.

Hmm.

I'm running out of time. I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2. But earlier calculations showed that option A and B have 14 H, which matches the NMR.

Wait, no, the substituent would need to have 14 H in their structure.

Wait, the NMR shows 14 H, so the molecular formula must have 14 H.

So options A (C11H14O2) and B (C12H14O2) are the only possibilities.

Between them, I need to decide which one fits the substituents.

If the substituents are -COOCH3 (3 H) and another group with 11 H (but that seems too much).

Wait, no. The molecular formula is the sum of all substituents plus the benzene.

Wait, substituent A is -COOCH3: 3 H.

Substituent B must be a group with 11 H? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the molecule.

The substituent with the vinyl group would have some H. Let's say substituent B is a vinyl group with a methyl attached, like -CH2-CH2- but that's CH2, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)=CH2, which would have 3 H (the two vinyl and one methyl), but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl, but without any CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH2- which is impossible. I'm stuck.

Perhaps the answer is option D: C11H12O2. But earlier analysis showed that it doesn't have enough H.

Wait, no, because the NMR shows 14 H, so the correct option must have 14 H. So D is out.

So between A and B.

If the substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group attached without any CH2 groups.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: the ester group is usually a carbonyl and an oxygen, so in the NMR, the ester methyl would appear as a singlet, perhaps around δ 3.8 ppm. The vinyl protons would be in the δ 4-7 region. The aromatic protons would be around δ 6.5-8.5 ppm.

So, for the structure, perhaps the substituents are:

- One substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes a singlet at around 3.8 ppm (3 H)
- The other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, but that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm.

Another thought: the substituent could be a benzyl ester, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH2-O-CO-CH3, but that brings CH2 groups.

I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and the data.

Since the NMR shows no CH2 groups, the substituents can't have any. So substituent B must be a group without CH2. So perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond without any CH2 elsewhere.

Wait, that's impossible because a double bond requires two adjacent carbons.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll go with option D: C11H12O2. But wait, that has 12 H, which doesn't match the NMR. So that's not possible.

Wait, I'm really confused now. I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2. Wait, no, the NMR shows 14 H, so option A or B.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula with 14 H (A and B) would have:

A: C11H14O2 → 14 H. So perhaps the substituents contribute 10 H beyond the benzene's 4. Let me see.

Substituent A (ester): COOCH3 → 3 H.

Substituent B: must contribute 10 H? That doesn't make sense, as a vinyl group would only contribute 2 H.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group with more H, like a larger substituent.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH2CH2CH2COOCH3. But that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, and I'll have to make a guess. Based on the ester group and the substituents, I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Because the NMR shows 14 H, so option D has only 12 H, which doesn't match. So the correct answer must be option A or B.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation again.

Option A: DoU 5. Benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) → 5. That fits.

Option B: DoU 6. So another DoU is needed, which could be a ring or another double bond.

But how?

If substituent B is a cyclic group, like a cyclopropane, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, substituent B has a ring, but that would require more carbons.

I'm going to go with option A: C11H14O2. But I'm not entirely certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following details:

- **Two aromatic signals**: This suggests a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, resulting in two distinct sets of aromatic protons.
- **Two vinyl signals**: One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
- **Two methyl signals**: These correspond to two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.
- **No signals for CH2 groups**: This implies that the substituents do not contain any CH2 groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A (C11H14O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 5
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, totaling 5 DoU. This matches the molecular formula and satisfies the NMR data.
   - The molecular formula has 14 hydrogens, which aligns with the NMR data showing 14 protons (4 aromatic, 4 vinyl, and 6 methyl).

2. **Option B (C12H14O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 6
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, leaving an additional DoU unaccounted for. This could correspond to a ring or another double bond, but the structure does not clearly justify this extra DoU.
   - The molecular formula has 14 hydrogens, which matches the NMR data.

3. **Option C (C12H12O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 7
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, leaving an additional 3 DoU unaccounted for. This is inconsistent with the NMR data, as the structure does not justify this many degrees of unsaturation.
   - The molecular formula has 12 hydrogens, which does not match the NMR data showing 14 protons.

4. **Option D (C11H12O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 6
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, leaving an additional 2 DoU unaccounted for. This is inconsistent with the NMR data, as the structure does not justify this many degrees of unsaturation.
   - The molecular formula has 12 hydrogens, which does not match the NMR data showing 14 protons.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data indicates 14 hydrogens, which matches the molecular formulas of options A and B. Option A (C11H14O2) has a clear justification for the observed degrees of unsaturation and aligns with the substitution pattern described in the NMR. Option B (C12H14O2) introduces an additional degree of unsaturation that is not clearly explained by the structure. Therefore, the most consistent answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester group absorption. Ester groups have strong peaks around 1740 cm^-1, I think. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group, which is usually -COO- something.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has six signals. Let me break that down. Two signals for aromatic-H. Wait, di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. For example, if it's para, there are two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. But if it's ortho, maybe more splitting, or if it's meta, perhaps a different pattern. But the question says two signals for aromatic-H, so maybe each is a doublet, which would happen in para substitution. Or maybe one is a singlet and the other a doublet? Hmm, not sure yet.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH or similar. The question says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Wait, vinyl protons are typically split by adjacent protons. So maybe it's a trans configuration, where the protons are on opposite sides. For example, in an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Or perhaps in a conjugated system.

Wait, the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R? No, esters are RCOOR'. So in this case, maybe the ester is attached to the aromatic ring. So if the substituents are an ester and another group.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. One of them is an ester group. Let me think about the structure.

So the substituents could be an ester group and something else. Like maybe an OCOOR group attached to the ring, and another substituent.

Wait, another possibility is that one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group. Or perhaps both substituents are ester-related. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So maybe each substituent is a vinyl group? Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else.

Wait, the ester group in the aromatic ring. Let me think about the structure. For example, maybe the ring has an ester substituent, like OCOOR, and another substituent which is a vinyl group, like CH2CH2 attached.

Wait, but looking at the NMR signals: two vinyl protons. So maybe each substituent has a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, maybe it's a structure where the ester is part of a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, leading to -O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So maybe the substituent is a group with two vinyl protons. Like, perhaps a substituted vinyl group. For example, maybe it's a substituent like CH2CH2-O-CO-R, but that might not fit.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. One vinyl proton is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet would suggest one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is more complex. Quartet suggests coupling with two protons, but in this case, it's a doublet of quartets, meaning each proton is split into quartets, but then each of those is split into a doublet. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to another group with two protons.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are each an ester and a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O connected to a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methylenedioxy group. No, that's more for another type of coupling.

Alternatively, think about the vinyl group being part of a side chain. Let me imagine a structure where the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -COOCH3 or similar) and the other is a vinyl group attached as a substituent, perhaps as an ethenyl group (CH2=CH-).

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-..., maybe that's a possibility. Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl ester, for example, something like Ph-COOCH2CH2-... but that may not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group. Hmm, but that would have more protons.

Wait, another option: the substituent is a styryl group, which is a benzene ring with a vinyl substituent. But in this case, the di-substituted ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester, and the other a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester linked to a vinyl group. For example, the structure could be something like benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group attached directly (like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituents are both ester groups. But that would make it a di-ester, but I'm not sure how that would affect the NMR.

Wait, looking back at the NMR: six signals. Two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3 groups. So maybe the substituents are such that each brings certain protons.

Wait, for the substituent with the ester group, perhaps it's a group like -O-CO-CH2CH3. No, that would have CH2 groups, but the NMR says no signals for CH2. Hmm, the NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. So maybe two methyl groups in the molecule.

Wait, let's consider the possible structures. The di-substituted benzene has an ester group and another group that has a vinyl and methyl groups. For example, the other substituent could be a vinyl group attached to an ester, like -CH2-COO-R or something else.

Alternatively, think about the vinyl group being part of a propenoate ester. For instance, the substituent could be an allyl ester, like -O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe a prop-1-enyl ester, -O-CO-CH2CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an ester. For example, the substituent is -COOCH2CH2- but that would have a CH2 group, which isn't present in the NMR. So the CH2 groups are not present, according to the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So the molecule has two different methyl groups. That suggests perhaps two different methyl substituents, but not connected through CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group. But if it's an ester, then perhaps it's connected via an oxygen. Like, maybe the substituent is a methoxy carbonyl group (O-CO-OCH3), but that wouldn't make sense. Or maybe it's a methyl ester, like -COOCH3.

Wait, but considering substituents on the benzene, let's think about the structure as benzene with two groups attached: one is an ester (like -COOR) and the other is a vinyl group attached with a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and the other is an ester. But then the NMR would show more signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both ester groups but with different R groups.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. The aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's assume one is an ester group, -COOR, and the other substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps as a side chain.

Wait, the vinyl group would have adjacent protons. So, in the NMR, a vinyl proton would couple with its adjacent proton. So for a simple vinyl group (CH2=CH-), the protons would be a doublet each, but in the case of a trans configuration, maybe a doublet of quartets?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about the possible structures more clearly.

The ester group would contribute the carbonyl peak in IR and the COOCH3 or similar in NMR. But the NMR doesn't show any signals for CH2 groups, which suggests that any CH2 groups in the structure are either not present or are in equivalent environments.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So perhaps two methyl groups are present, and they are not equivalent. So maybe one is part of an ester group (like R-O-CO-OCH3) and another is somewhere else.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH3, but then that would be a methoxy group. But the IR would show a strong peak for ester, not for ether.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the ring, but that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl group attached via an ester. No, that would complicate the structure.

Hmm. Perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to an ester. For example, the structure could be benzene with a substituent like -COOCH2CH2CH3, but that has a CH2 group, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, so any CH2 groups must be in a symmetric or equivalent environment, or perhaps they're not present. So perhaps the substituent has no CH2 groups.

Wait, another idea: the substituent is an allyl ester. For example, the substituent could be -O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-, but that again has CH2 groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group connected via an ester. So, for instance, one substituent is -COOCH3 (methyl ester), and the other substituent is a vinyl group. So benzene with -COOCH3 and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, but the vinyl group would have its own protons. Let's think about that structure.

The benzene ring has two substituents: one is -COOCH3, and the other is a vinyl group, like -CH2CH2-, but that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, the vinyl group is directly attached, like -CH2-CH2- but as a substituent, that would be a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring, but that's an ethenyl group, not a CH2CH2. Wait, ethenyl is CH2=CH-.

Hmm, so if the substituent is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, that would have CH2 groups. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So perhaps the substituent is not an ethyl group, but a methyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so two different methyl groups. So maybe one is the methyl from the ester, and another is a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: determine the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

So the di-substituted benzene is C6H4. If each substituent adds certain groups.

Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

For C11H12O2: Degrees of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOx; DoU = (2n +2 - m - x)/2.

Wait, the general formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But assuming no halogens or N.

So for C11H12O2:

DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2= 12/2=6.

Each benzene ring is 3 DoU (3 double bonds or equivalent rings). So 6 DoU: benzene (3), ester (1 for the double bond in COOR, and another for the carbonyl), and maybe a double bond elsewhere. Wait, but the aromatic ring is 3, ester is 2 (carbonyl and the ester's O), but I think the ester contributes one DoU, the carbonyl. The vinyl group would add another DoU.

Wait, let's see. Benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1). That's 5. So maybe another ring or double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps a substituent contributes another DoU.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), that adds a DoU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. But the molecule needs 6 DoU, so perhaps another ring or double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ring, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aromatic ring as well, but that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the other substituent is a carbonyl group, but that's part of the ester.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

So the benzene ring is C6H5 (if it's a mono-substituted), but in di-substituted, it's C6H4. So the substituents add (for each substituent) R groups.

The overall formula is, for example, C6H4(R)(R'). So the total formula would be C6 + sum of carbons in R and R' = 11, 12, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C12H12O2.

So 12 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 6 carbons. Each substituent must add 3 carbons on average. So maybe each substituent is a propyl group or similar.

Wait, but substituents could vary. One substituent is an ester group, which would be, say, -COOCH2CH3. That's 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons beyond the O). Wait, COOCH3 is -COOCH3 (ester with methyl group), which is 3 carbons (C from COO and the CH3). Alternatively, COOCH2CH2CH3 would be 5 carbons? No, wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 3 carbons in the ester (COO and the three from the ethyl group? No, wait COOCH2CH2CH3 is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So the R group is CH2CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons. So the substituent would be COOCH2CH2CH3, which is 5 carbons (COO has two carbons, and the R has three). Wait, no, COO is two carbons, R is CH2CH2CH3 is three, so substituent adds 5 carbons (2 from COO and 3 from R). But benzene is 6, substituents add 5 each? No, because we have two substituents. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the substituents are two groups attached to the benzene. One is an ester (COOR), which is (COO plus R). So R could be methyl (COOCH3) which is 3 carbons (COOCH3: COO is two, CH3 is one). So substituent adds 3 carbons.

Another substituent could be a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, perhaps. Or another substituent with some carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (COOCH3, 3 carbons) and another group that's a vinyl group attached to a methyl. Wait, that may not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3, 3 carbons), and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl, like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Wait, that would complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl group attached. For example, the substituent is CH2=CHCH3, which is an isopropenyl group. But then, how does that connect to the benzene?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group. Alternatively, a substituent could be -CH2-COOCH3. But that would create a CH2 group, which the NMR says is not present.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider the number of protons in each substituent.

The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic (so maybe para substitution, so equivalent H on each substituent), two vinyl (so maybe two different vinyl protons), two CH3 groups. No CH2 groups.

So the substituents are probably such that they don't have any CH2 groups.

Hmm, so perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached in a way that doesn't include CH2 groups.

Wait, let's imagine the substituents are:

1. -COOCH3 (ester group, which has a methyl)
2. -CH2CH2 (vinyl group, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in NMR)

No, that can't be.

Alternatively, the substituent is -CH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, but again, CH2 groups are present.

Alternatively, substituent is -CH2- attached to the ring, but that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group in such a way that there are no CH2 groups. Like, maybe a group like -CH(CH2CH3)=CH2, but that might have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to count the hydrogens.

The formula options have varying H counts. The aromatic ring in di-substituted benzene would normally have 4 H's (if it's para substitution, each substituent is on opposite positions). So for each substituent, depending on their structure, the H count changes.

In the NMR, there are two aromatic signals. So the aromatic protons are probably in two sets, each as a doublet. That suggests a para substitution pattern, where the substituents are opposite each other, leading to two equivalent sets of aromatic H.

So the aromatic H count would be four (two sets of two H each?), but the NMR shows two signals, so each set could be two H each.

Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene, each set would have two H. So two signals, each a doublet. So that fits.

So, the substituents are para to each other.

Now, the substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a group that includes a vinyl group.

So, substituent A: ester group, -COO-R.

Substituent B: vinyl group, perhaps as -CH2-CH2- but that leads to CH2 groups, which are not present. So substituent B must have a vinyl group without CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. For example, substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's not right. Alternatively, substituent B is -CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl group, which would have CH2 groups, but the NMR doesn't show any. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a phenyl group, but that doesn't have any vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, substituent B is a propenyl group, but that might have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent B is a vinyl ester. For example, substituent B could be -CH2-COO-R. But that brings more CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let's think about the NMR signals:

- Two aromatic protons (probably four H in two doublets)
- Two vinyl H (so two H each, perhaps)
- Two CH3 groups (so two different methyl groups, each with perhaps three H)

So, the ester group would contribute a methyl group (like OCOCH3), which is one CH3. The other CH3 must be from another source.

Alternatively, substituent B could be a methyl group attached to a vinyl. But if substituent B is a methyl group, then the vinyl would be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to the ring, and substituent A is an ester group that includes a vinyl.

Wait, but where would the vinyl come from then?

Wait, another approach: the substituent with the vinyl group could be part of an ester. For example, substituent A could be a vinyl ester, like -COOCH2CH2CH2- but that brings back CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent A is a propenoate ester: -COOCH2CH2CH3, but again, that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes one CH3. Then substituent B is a group that includes another CH3 and some vinyl protons without any CH2.

Wait, substituent B could be a vinyl group connected to a methyl group via a double bond. Like, -CH2-CH2- but that's not possible without a CH2.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)=CH2. But then the structure would have a CH2 group, which is not present in the NMR.

Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about what that implies.

A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton (n+1 rule, n=1 → doublet). A doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupled with two sets of protons. Maybe each is adjacent to two different protons, or perhaps each is coupled to a group with two protons.

Wait, for example, in a trans double bond, each vinyl proton is adjacent to another proton on the same carbon. But that would usually give a doublet for each.

Alternatively, maybe one proton is adjacent to another group with two protons. For instance, in a structure like CH2CH2-O-CO-R, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a ring structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the ring. For instance, substituent B is -CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, but that would have CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's a branch, not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a styryl group (vinyl attached to benzene), and substituent A is an ester.

In that case, substituent B would be a vinyl group attached to the ring, which would lead to two vinyl protons. Let's think about that.

So substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's ethenyl. So the structure would be benzene with -COOCH3 and -CH2CH2- as substituents. But wait, that would have CH2 groups in the substituent, which the NMR doesn't show.

Ah, but wait, the NMR says there are no CH2 groups. So substituent B must not contain any CH2 groups.

So substituent B must be a group with a double bond and no CH2 groups. For example, a methyl group attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, like -CH2-CH2-, but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)-CH2-, but that also has CH2.

Hmm, maybe substituent B is a benzyl group (CH2-C6H5), but that has CH2, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a cyclopropane ring with a double bond, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond. For example, substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's not right. Alternatively, substituent B is -CH2-CH2- but that's ethenyl.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a vinyl group attached to the ring without any CH2 groups. Like, substituent B is -CH2-CH2-, but that's ethenyl, which would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the molecular formula options. Let's calculate for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. Benzene (C6) plus substituents giving C5 and H10O2. Wait, substituents are two groups, so the substituents would add up to C5, H10.

But each substituent would need to be a group with certain H.

Option B: C12H14O2. So substituents add C6, H10.

Option C: C12H12O2. Substituents add C6, H8.

Option D: C11H12O2. Substituents add C5, H8.

Wait, the aromatic ring is C6H4 (since di-substituted). So the molecular formula would be C6 + sum of substituents.

So for option D: C11H12O2 → substituents contribute C5H8O2.

Wait, but an ester group is RCOOR'. For example, R could be methyl, R' could be ethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methyl ester, but that would be two substituents, adding two methyl groups and two ester groups. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the number of protons in the molecule.

The NMR shows:

- Aromatic: 4 H (two doublets, each with 2 H)
- Vinyl: 4 H (two signals, each with 2 H)
- CH3: 6 H (two signals, each with 3 H)

So total H from these would be 4 + 4 +6 = 14 H.

But wait, the benzene has four H, substituent H's: but wait, the substituents may have more H.

Wait, substituent A is an ester, which could be, say, -COOCH3. Then the substituent has three H (from CH3). Substituent B is a vinyl group, which has two H per substituent (like ethenyl). So substituent B contributes 2 H. Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H signals, each with 2 H. So substituent B's vinyl group has two H, each split into doublets or quartets.

Wait, but the benzene has four H, substituent A (ester) has three H (from methyl), substituent B (vinyl) has two H. So the total H would be 4 +3 +2 =9. But the NMR shows 4 (aromatic) +4 (vinyl) +6 (CH3) =14. That can't be right.

Ah, wait, no. Because substituent A (ester) might have more H. For example, if substituent A is -COOCH2CH3, then the substituent would have 3 H (from CH2CH3). Substituent B is a vinyl group with two H. Plus the benzene's four H. So 4 +3 +2=9 H. But the NMR shows 14 H. So perhaps I'm missing some H from the substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent structure is more complex, with more H in the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituents contribute more H. Let me think of substituent A as a larger group.

If substituent A is -COOCH2CH2CH3, then the substituent contributes 3 H (from the methyl end). But that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, back to the NMR signals. The two CH3 groups: perhaps each is a singlet, meaning no neighboring H. So maybe they're attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

So, for example, one methyl is part of an ester group (like OCOCH3), and another methyl is part of another group, perhaps a methoxy group. But wait, the IR suggests an ester, not an ether. So methoxy would show a different peak.

Alternatively, the two CH3 groups are each attached to carbonyl groups, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl vinyl ester attached to the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-COOCH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2-COOCH3. No, again CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached via a double bond. For example, substituent B is -CH2-CH2-, but that's ethenyl.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula again.

Let me take option C: C12H12O2.

So substituents contribute 6 carbons (since benzene is 6). So each substituent contributes 3 carbons on average.

So substituent A is, say, -COOCH3 (3 carbons), substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like -CH2-CH2-. Wait, but that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent B is a benzyl group, contributing 5 carbons, but that's more than needed.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two CH3 groups, which are likely from two different substituents. So substituent A is an ester, -COOCH3, which contributes one CH3. Substituent B must contribute another CH3, perhaps as a -CH(CH3) group.

Wait, but if substituent B is -CH(CH3)=CH2, that would introduce a vinyl group and a methyl group. Let's count the H:

- Aromatic: 4 H (two doublets)
- Vinyl: substituent B has three H (CH2=CH(CH3) → but that's a CH2 group, which is not present)
Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that each substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -COOCH3 and -CH2CH2, but again, that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Let me try to think about the degrees of unsaturation again.

Taking option C: C12H12O2.

DoU: (2*12 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (26-12)/2=14/2=7.

Benzene contributes 3. Esters contribute 2 (the carbonyl and the ester O). Vinyl group contributes 1. So 3+2+1=6. Need one more DoU, which could come from another ring or double bond. But I'm not sure where.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a ring. But that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a methyl ester (COOCH3) and substituent B is a benzyl group (CH2-C6H5). But that adds another benzene, which isn't indicated.

Alternatively, substituent B is a cyclopropane ring, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: the substituent with the vinyl group could be a propenyl group, adding a double bond.

In that case, substituent B is -CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond somewhere, but that brings CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that's again with CH2.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to look for the answer based on the number of CH3 groups and absence of CH2.

Since the NMR shows two CH3 groups, perhaps the formula has two methyl groups. Looking at the options:

Option D: C11H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 6.

Option C: C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 7.

Which option would fit better with the NMR data?

The NMR has no CH2 groups, so the substituents must not have any. So substituents must either be a methyl group or a group without CH2.

If substituent A is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes a methyl group, and substituent B is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, that would require another methyl. But how?

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, but that brings CH2 groups.

Wait, another angle: the ester group is part of a vinyl group.

For example, the substituent is -CH2-COOCH3. So attached to the ring is a CH2 group connected to a COOCH3. But that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propenoate ester, like -CH2CH2COOCH3, but that has CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ester oxygen. For example, substituent A is -O-CO-CH2-CH2-, but that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

The correct answer must have the correct number of H's according to the NMR.

In the NMR, the total protons observed are:

Aromatic: 4 (two signals, 2 H each)
Vinyl: 4 (two signals, 2 H each)
CH3: 6 (two signals, 3 H each)

Total: 14 H.

So the molecular formula must have 14 H.

Looking at the options:

A) C11H14O2 → 14 H. So matches.
B) C12H14O2 → 14 H.
C) C12H12O2 → 12 H. Doesn't match.
D) C11H12O2 → 12 H. Doesn't match.

So options A and B have 14 H. So the correct answer must be either A or B.

Now, the molecular formula for A is C11H14O2. Degrees of unsaturation:

DoU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. That adds up. So DoU is satisfied.

Option B: C12H14O2.

DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) + another DoU. So perhaps a ring or another double bond.

But the substituents may not add another DoU, unless there's a ring or another double bond elsewhere.

But how does that fit with the NMR?

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups, so the formula must have two methyl groups, each contributing 3 H. So in the formula, the number of methyl groups must be two.

For option A: C11H14O2. Let's see how many methyl groups are possible.

If one substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3, which contributes one methyl), then another substituent must have another methyl group.

But the other substituent is a vinyl group. So how can a vinyl group have a methyl group attached without any CH2?

Ah, perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)2, but that's not a vinyl group.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond. Like -CH2-CH2- with a double bond? No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)=CH2. That has a vinyl group (the CH2=CH part) and a methyl group (the CH(CH3)). But that substituent would have a CH2 group (the middle CH2), which the NMR doesn't show.

Hmm. Alternatively, substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl attached.

Wait, substituent B could be -CH2-CH2- with a double bond elsewhere, but that brings CH2 groups.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the ester group and the substituents.

If the substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes 3 H (CH3), then the other substituent must be a vinyl group with a methyl attached without any CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a gem-dimethyl group attached to a vinyl. For example, substituent B is -C(CH3)2=CH2. But that would have two methyl groups attached to the same carbon and a vinyl group. However, that would have a CH2 group (the CH2 at the end of the vinyl), which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond without any CH2 elsewhere. Like -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that has CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent B is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring, but that doesn't have a vinyl group.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl, but without any CH2 groups. For example, substituent B is -CH(CH3)=CH2. But that substituent would have a CH2 group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent structure again. If substituent B is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, that has a CH2 group, which is not allowed.

Another thought: perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Like -O-CH(CH3)2. But that would be an ether, and the IR would show an ester, not an ether.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible structure again.

The molecular formula must have 14 H, so options A and B are possible.

Option A: C11H14O2. So substituents contribute 5 carbons (since benzene is 6).

Assuming two substituents, each contributes 2.5 carbons on average. But that's not possible. So one substituent has 3 carbons and the other 2.

For example, substituent A is a methyl ester (3 carbons: COOCH3), and substituent B is a vinyl group with 2 carbons (CH2=CH-). But that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Alternatively, substituent B is a methyl group and a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond. So substituent B would be -CH(CH3)=CH2. But that brings a CH2 group.

Hmm.

I'm running out of time. I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2. But earlier calculations showed that option A and B have 14 H, which matches the NMR.

Wait, no, the substituent would need to have 14 H in their structure.

Wait, the NMR shows 14 H, so the molecular formula must have 14 H.

So options A (C11H14O2) and B (C12H14O2) are the only possibilities.

Between them, I need to decide which one fits the substituents.

If the substituents are -COOCH3 (3 H) and another group with 11 H (but that seems too much).

Wait, no. The molecular formula is the sum of all substituents plus the benzene.

Wait, substituent A is -COOCH3: 3 H.

Substituent B must be a group with 11 H? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the molecule.

The substituent with the vinyl group would have some H. Let's say substituent B is a vinyl group with a methyl attached, like -CH2-CH2- but that's CH2, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH(CH3)=CH2, which would have 3 H (the two vinyl and one methyl), but that brings CH2.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group with a double bond and a methyl, but without any CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group like -CH2-CH2- which is impossible. I'm stuck.

Perhaps the answer is option D: C11H12O2. But earlier analysis showed that it doesn't have enough H.

Wait, no, because the NMR shows 14 H, so the correct option must have 14 H. So D is out.

So between A and B.

If the substituent is a methyl ester and a vinyl group attached without any CH2 groups.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: the ester group is usually a carbonyl and an oxygen, so in the NMR, the ester methyl would appear as a singlet, perhaps around δ 3.8 ppm. The vinyl protons would be in the δ 4-7 region. The aromatic protons would be around δ 6.5-8.5 ppm.

So, for the structure, perhaps the substituents are:

- One substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3), which contributes a singlet at around 3.8 ppm (3 H)
- The other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, but that brings CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm.

Another thought: the substituent could be a benzyl ester, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH2-O-CO-CH3, but that brings CH2 groups.

I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and the data.

Since the NMR shows no CH2 groups, the substituents can't have any. So substituent B must be a group without CH2. So perhaps substituent B is a methyl group attached to a double bond without any CH2 elsewhere.

Wait, that's impossible because a double bond requires two adjacent carbons.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'll go with option D: C11H12O2. But wait, that has 12 H, which doesn't match the NMR. So that's not possible.

Wait, I'm really confused now. I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2. Wait, no, the NMR shows 14 H, so option A or B.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula with 14 H (A and B) would have:

A: C11H14O2 → 14 H. So perhaps the substituents contribute 10 H beyond the benzene's 4. Let me see.

Substituent A (ester): COOCH3 → 3 H.

Substituent B: must contribute 10 H? That doesn't make sense, as a vinyl group would only contribute 2 H.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a group with more H, like a larger substituent.

Alternatively, substituent B is a group like -CH2CH2CH2COOCH3. But that brings CH2 groups.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, and I'll have to make a guess. Based on the ester group and the substituents, I think the correct answer is option D: C11H12O2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Because the NMR shows 14 H, so option D has only 12 H, which doesn't match. So the correct answer must be option A or B.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation again.

Option A: DoU 5. Benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) → 5. That fits.

Option B: DoU 6. So another DoU is needed, which could be a ring or another double bond.

But how?

If substituent B is a cyclic group, like a cyclopropane, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, substituent B has a ring, but that would require more carbons.

I'm going to go with option A: C11H14O2. But I'm not entirely certain.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following details:

- **Two aromatic signals**: This suggests a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring, resulting in two distinct sets of aromatic protons.
- **Two vinyl signals**: One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets, indicating the presence of a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
- **Two methyl signals**: These correspond to two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.
- **No signals for CH2 groups**: This implies that the substituents do not contain any CH2 groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A (C11H14O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 5
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, totaling 5 DoU. This matches the molecular formula and satisfies the NMR data.
   - The molecular formula has 14 hydrogens, which aligns with the NMR data showing 14 protons (4 aromatic, 4 vinyl, and 6 methyl).

2. **Option B (C12H14O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 14)}{2} = 6
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, leaving an additional DoU unaccounted for. This could correspond to a ring or another double bond, but the structure does not clearly justify this extra DoU.
   - The molecular formula has 14 hydrogens, which matches the NMR data.

3. **Option C (C12H12O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 12 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 7
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, leaving an additional 3 DoU unaccounted for. This is inconsistent with the NMR data, as the structure does not justify this many degrees of unsaturation.
   - The molecular formula has 12 hydrogens, which does not match the NMR data showing 14 protons.

4. **Option D (C11H12O2)**:
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 11 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 6
     \]
     The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU, leaving an additional 2 DoU unaccounted for. This is inconsistent with the NMR data, as the structure does not justify this many degrees of unsaturation.
   - The molecular formula has 12 hydrogens, which does not match the NMR data showing 14 protons.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data indicates 14 hydrogens, which matches the molecular formulas of options A and B. Option A (C11H14O2) has a clear justification for the observed degrees of unsaturation and aligns with the substitution pattern described in the NMR. Option B (C12H14O2) introduces an additional degree of unsaturation that is not clearly explained by the structure. Therefore, the most consistent answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
