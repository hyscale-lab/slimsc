Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I remember that when a point charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields, and these are described by the scalar and vector potentials. The question is asking for the expressions of these potentials at a certain time and position.

The setup is that the charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the field at point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So the distance between those points is d, I think. The velocity of the charge at the generating time tr is v.

Wait, the potentials are to be found at time t, where t is greater than tr. So t is after the charge emitted the field that we're observing. I remember that in electrodynamics, the potentials have retarded time dependence because the fields propagate at the speed of light.

The scalar potential V is usually related to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. The formulas I know are:

The electric field E is given by the negative gradient of V minus the time derivative of A. But wait, the potentials themselves depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

For the scalar potential V, I think it's (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by some factor. Oh right, the scalar potential from a moving charge should account for the displacement current or something? Or does it just depend on the charge's position at the retarded time?

Wait, no. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) would be [q/(4πε₀)] * (1/|r - r’|), where r’ is the position of the charge at time tr. But in this problem, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - r’(tr). So the magnitude is |d|, which we can denote as just d if d is a vector.

Then V would be (q/(4πε₀ d)). Wait, but wait, in the options, some have terms like (d c - d·v), which might come from the Lorentz contraction or something considering the motion.

Wait, no, maybe the scalar potential isn't modified by the motion of the charge, only the vector potential. Because the scalar potential is mainly due to the electric charge, while the vector potential is due to the current.

Wait, but when the charge is moving, its velocity contributes to the magnetic field. So for the vector potential A, the expression would involve the velocity of the charge.

The standard expression for the vector potential from a moving charge is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function. But I need to think about the exact form.

I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (r - r')) / (|r - r’|²) or something like that. Or wait, I might be mixing it up with the magnetic field formula. Let me recall: The vector potential due to a moving charge is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (something). Or perhaps it's (μ₀ q v × r)/(4π c² something).

Wait, another approach: The potentials are given by the Lienard potentials. Oh, right, when you have a charge in motion, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/(d) times some correction involving the velocity? Or is it just 1/d? Hmm.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d - (v · d)/c² )) or something like that. Because the charge's velocity introduces a sort of Lorentz contraction effect. Similarly, the vector potential A would involve the velocity multiplied by similar factors.

Alternatively, maybe the scalar potential is the static one, and the vector potential has a term involving the velocity.

Let me think of the general expressions. The potentials are:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ (1/|r - r'|) ] at the retarded time tr, but considering the time it takes for the field to reach r. Wait, but in terms of the vector d, which is r - r’(tr), so |d| is the distance. So V would be ( q )/(4πε₀ |d| ) multiplied by some factor, possibly 1/(1 - (v·d)/c²) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c² (something)).

Wait, in the context of special relativity, the expression for potentials might involve a Lorentz factor. The correction would come from the fact that the charge's velocity affects the field's propagation.

I think the exact expressions for the potentials are:

V(r, t) = [ q ] / [4πε₀ (d - (v · d)/c² ) ]

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's (d c² - v · d) in the denominator. Let me think: The denominator could be (d c² - v · d), which simplifies to d(c² - v²/c²) if v is perpendicular, but that might not be the case.

Wait, wait, another thought: The potentials are calculated using the retarded time, and the expressions involve terms like 1/(d - (v · d)/c² ). That is, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - r'(tr). Then, the denominator becomes d c² - v · d, but only when multiplied by c² perhaps.

Wait, let me get the exact expressions. I think the scalar potential V is [ q ] / [4πε₀ (d c - v · d) ] multiplied by 1/c, perhaps? Or not. Let me think about units.

Alternatively, I remember that the potentials are:

V(r, t) = ( q / (4πε₀) ) * [ (γ) / |r - βγ r’| ] where β = v/c, γ is the Lorentz factor. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the form of the potentials for a moving charge. The vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (1/(something))).

Wait, another approach: The problem states that the options are in terms of d and v. Let me look at the options.

Option C: V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), which seems to have units of [charge] * [velocity] / [distance], but let's check the units.

Wait, units might help. Let me think: The scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is joules per coulomb (J/C). The denominator in the options must have units of meters.

Looking at option B:

V = q/(4πε₀ r), which has units of (C) / (m * ε₀). Since ε₀ has units of F/m (farads per meter), which is (C²·s²)/(kg·m³). So 1/(ε₀) has units kg·m³/(C²·s²). So V (option B) has units (C * kg·m³/(C²·s² * m)) ) = kg·m²/(C s²), which is (kg·m²)/(C·s²). But the unit for V should be volts, which is (kg·m²)/(C·s³). Hmm, so perhaps option B's units are off. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let's compute V in option B: [V] = [q]/([4πε₀] [r]). [q] is Coulombs (C). [ε₀] is F/m (C²/(N·m²)) ). So 1/ε₀ is N·m²/C². So [V] = C * (N·m²/C²) / m ) → C * (N·m²/(C² m)) ) → (N·m²/C ) / m → N·m²/(C m) → N·m/(C). Since N·m is J, so [V] = J/C → Volts, which is correct. So option B's units are correct. But is the expression correct?

Wait, but in reality, the scalar potential for a moving charge is more complicated than just 1/r. So, option B is probably incorrect because it's the same as the static case, but the charge is moving, so there might be a correction.

Looking at option C:

V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c – v·d)). Let's check the units. numerator: q (C) * c (m/s) → C·m/s. denominator: (m * m/s – (m/s)·m ) → (m²/s). So denominator is m²/s.

So overall, V has units (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = (C) / m. But volts are (J/C) → (C·m²/(s³·C)) ) → m²/(s³). So option C's V has units C/m, which is not volts. That can't be right. So option C might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me recalculate.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - ... )).

Wait, [V] is (q * c) / [ε₀ (d c - ... )].

But [ε₀] is F/m → C²/(N·m²) → (C²·s²)/(kg·m³).

So [V] = [q] [c] / ( [ε₀] [d] [c] )

= (C)(m/s) / ( (C² s²)/(kg m³) ) * m * (m/s) )

Wait, denominator: [ε₀] [d] [c] → (C² s²)/(kg m³) ) * m * (m/s) → (C² s² m²)/(kg m³ s) ) → (C² s)/(kg m )

So overall, [V] = (C m/s ) / ( (C² s)/(kg m) )) → (kg m²)/(C s²), which is (kg m²)/(C s³ * s) → wait, no, let me compute the units properly.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. An alternative is to think that the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d), which is a scalar. So the denominator is in meters*(m/s) minus (m/s)*m → m²/s.

So the denominator is m²/s.

Numerator is q*c → C*(m/s).

So V = [ (C m/s) ] / [ (m²/s) ) ] → (C m/s) * (s/m²) → C/(m). Which is C/m, which isn't volts. So option C can't be correct.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps none of the options have the correct units? That can't be. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is J/C. J is kg·m²/s². So V = kg·m²/(C·s³).

Looking at option D:

V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + v·d)).

Same as option C but with a plus sign. Let's compute the units.

Numerator: q * c → C*(m/s).

Denominator: (d c + v·d) → d is m, c is m/s, v is m/s, d·v is m²/s.

So denominator is (m*(m/s) ) + (m²/s ) → m²/s + m²/s → same units, m²/s.

So denominator is m²/s.

So V's units: (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → (C m/s) * (s)/(m²) ) → C/(m). Again, C/m, which is wrong. So options C and D have V in wrong units.

Option A: V = q/(4πε₀ r ), which is same as option B but without velocity. So units are correct as I saw earlier. But I thought moving charge's potential is different.

Option B: V is same as static case; vector A is (v/c²) times V. So A would have units (m/s) * (V) → (m/s)(J/C) → (kg·m²/(C·s³)) * (m/s) → kg·m³/(C·s⁴). The unit for A is Tesla·m² or something? Wait, vector potential A has units of Tesla·meter²? Or let me think: The unit of A is Weber per meter (Wb/m), since B is Wb/m². But Weber is V·s, so Wb/m = (V·s)/m → (J·s/C)/m → (kg·m²/(s³·C)) · s / m → kg·m/(s²·C) → which is same as (kg·m²)/(s³·C) ) × (1/m) ) → kg·m/(s³·C). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

But looking at option B: V is correct in units, but vector A is (v/c²) times V. Let's see: vector A would have units (m/s) * (V) → (m/s)(J/C) → (kg·m²/(C·s³)) * (m/s) ) → kg·m³/(C·s⁴). But the correct unit for A is (kg·m²)/(C·s³). So option B's vector A has units kg·m³/(C·s⁴) which is kg·m/(C·s³), which is not matching. So option B is wrong.

Hmm, so what's left? Option A: V is static, A is v^2/c² * V. Let me check A's units.

Option A: A = (v²/c²) * V. So v is m/s, so v² is m²/s². c² is m²/s². So v²/c² is dimensionless. So A would have same units as V, which is volts. But A should have units of (kg·m²)/(C·s³). So option A is wrong, as A has same units as V, which is volts, but vector potential's units are different.

Wait, but I think I'm getting tangled in the units. Maybe I should think about the expressions more conceptually.

The general expressions for the potentials for a moving charge are:

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (|d| (1 - (v·d)/(c²|d|)) ) ].

Wait, because the denominator becomes |d| ( 1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|) ) ), which can be written as |d| - (v·d)/c². But since d is a vector, maybe it's better to express as sqrt( (|d|)^2 - (v·d)^2/c^4 )? Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d) / c². So 1/(denominator) would be c²/(c² |d| - v·d), making V = (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d)).

But wait, in terms of vector d, which has magnitude |d|, but d·v is a scalar. So the denominator isn't a vector, it's a scalar quantity.

So perhaps V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d)).

Wait, because if |d| is the distance, and v·d is the projection of v onto d multiplied by |d|. So c |d| is distance times c, and v·d is velocity times |d| in the direction of d.

So putting it together, the denominator would be (c |d| - v·d), and the numerator is q c, so V would look like option C or D.

Looking at option C: V = (q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

But wait, d is a vector, so in the denominator, they're using d c, which is a vector multiplied by c, but in the expression, it's probably scalar. Hmm, but the problem states that the denominator is (d c − vec{d}⋅vec{v}), which is a scalar since both terms are scalars.

Wait, the problem says the denominator is (d c − vec{d} ⋅ vec{v}), which is the same as c |d| − v·d if d is the vector from the charge to the field point, and |d| is the magnitude. So in that case, V would be [ q c ] / [4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) ].

Which matches the form of option C. So option C's V is correct.

Then, the vector potential A. I think the vector potential is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d')/( (c^2 |d| - v·d) ), where d' is a certain vector.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (d / (c² |d| - v·d) )) ), or something like that. Because A is related to the velocity and the displacement.

Wait, another thought: The vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d ) / ( (c² |d| ) - v·d )^2 ? Or perhaps it's (d × v)/(something).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the expressions again. The vector potential is usually given as A = (μ₀ I)/(4π) × something. For a point charge, the current is the charge times velocity, so I would be q v.

So perhaps A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by (d ) divided by (c² |d| - v·d) in some fashion.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is [μ₀ q c v ]/(4π (d c - v·d) )

Wait, so [μ₀ q c v ] / denominator.

Wait, but the denominator is (d c - v·d), which is same as (c |d| - v·d) if d is the vector pointing from the charge to r. Because d·v is v·d, which is the projection of v onto d.

So the denominator is (c |d| - v·d) as a scalar.

So the vector A in option C is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

But wait, the denominator is (d c - ... ), but that's a vector. Oh wait, no, the denominator is written as (d c - d·v), which is a scalar because d is a vector, but (d c) is a vector times a scalar, so that term is a vector, and (d·v) is a scalar. So that would make the denominator a vector minus a scalar. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, the problem says the denominator is (d c − vec{d} ⋅ vec{v}), which is a scalar. Because d is a vector, but d c is a vector multiplied by c, making it a vector. But vec{d} ⋅ vec{v} is scalar. So the denominator is a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem statement uses d as the scalar distance, not the vector. Wait, let me read the question again.

The question says: the vector d is from the field generating point to r. So d is a vector, and |d| is its magnitude. So the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which would be a vector (d multiplied by c) minus a scalar (d·v). That can't be right because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Ah, so perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, the denominator is ( |d| c - (d·v) ), which is a scalar. So perhaps in the options, the denominator should be ( |d| c - (d·v) ), which would make sense.

But looking at the options, option C's denominator is (d c - d·v ), which is vector minus scalar. So that can't be correct. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the term (d c) is actually |d| c. Because otherwise, the denominator isn't a scalar, which is necessary for the potentials to be scalars. So perhaps the options have a mistake. But given the options, I have to choose the best one.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d), which is a scalar. So in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d·v ), which is not correct. So perhaps the correct option isn't among the ones presented, but considering the options given, perhaps option C is the intended one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about when v is zero, the potentials should reduce to their static forms. So when v=0, V should be q/(4πε₀ r), and A should be zero.

Looking at the options:
- Option B: V is correct, A is (v/c²) V. When v=0, A=0. So in that case, option B would be correct when charge is stationary. But when the charge is moving, the potentials should change.

Wait, but for a stationary charge, the potentials are static. So option B would be correct for a static case. But the question is about a moving charge, so option B can't be the correct general case.

So, perhaps the correct potentials are when V is (q)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think of the Lienard potentials, which describe the fields of an accelerating charge. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/|r - r(t_r)| ] / (1 - (v·(r - r(t_r)) ) / c² |r - r(t_r)| )

But in terms of d, which is r - r(t_r), so |d| = |r - r(t_r)|.

So V becomes (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|) ) )

= (q/(4πε₀)) * |d| / ( c² |d| - v·d )

= (q |d| )/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

= (q / (4πε₀)) * (1/(c² - (v·d)/|d|² ) ) * (1/|d| )

= Not quite, perhaps not directly matching the options.

Wait, maybe factor out |d| from the denominator:

c² |d| - v·d = |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| )

But (v·d)/|d| is the projection of v in the direction of d, which is v cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

So, V = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/ ( |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| ) )

= q/(4πε₀ |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d|) )

= q/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

So in terms of vector d, since |d| is the magnitude of d, c² |d| - v·d is a scalar. So V is (q )/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

Looking at the options, option C has V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

Wait, so the denominator is c |d| - v·d, and the numerator is q c.

Which would make V = q c / [4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) ]

But according to the Lienard expression, V is q/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

So the denominator in option C has a c factor in the first term. So that's different.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps none of the options perfectly match the Lienard expression. But perhaps it's a matter of scaling.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me double-check.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( |r - r'(t_r)| ) ] / [ 1 - (v(t_r) · (r - r'(t_r)) )/( c² |r - r'(t_r)|² ) ]

Wait, no, that's not right. The denominator is 1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| ), where d is r - r'. So the expression is:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

= q/(4πε₀) * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) )

= q/(4πε₀) * (c² |d| ) / ( c² |d|² - v·d |d| )

Wait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the denominator as (c² |d| - v·d) in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should factor out |d| from the denominator:

Denominator: c² |d| - v·d = |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| )

So,

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| ) ) ]

= (q/(4πε₀ |d| )) * (1/(c² - (v·d)/|d| )) 

Which can be rewritten as (q/(4πε₀ |d| )) * ( |d|/(c² |d| - v·d) )

So,

V = q/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

So, the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d )

Comparing with the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option C:

V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

But the denominator here is (c |d| - v·d ), which is different from (c² |d| - v·d )

So perhaps the correct expression isn't among the options. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Lienard formula. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm not confident about the exact expressions, so perhaps I should think of the vector potential.

The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v(t_r) )/(4π) * [ (d × (v(t_r)/c² )) + (d × (d × (v(t_r)/c² )) )/( |d|² (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ) ]

Wait, no, that seems too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π) times something.

Wait, another approach: The vector potential is related to the current density J. For a point charge moving with velocity v, the current density is J = q v δ³(r - r’), where r’ is the charge's position.

The vector potential is A(r,t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ ( J(r', t_r) / |r - r’| ) dr'

So in this case, J(r', t_r) is q v δ³(r - r’(t_r) )

So,

A(r,t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) ∫ [ δ³(r - r’(t_r) ) / |r - r’| ] dr'

= (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * 1/|d|

Because the integral of δ³(r - r’) times 1/|r - r’| is 1/|d|.

So A(r,t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π |d| )

But wait, that can't be correct because the vector potential depends on the direction as well. Hmm, perhaps that's only the case when the charge is at rest. When it's moving, the expression changes.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the expression in terms of the vector d and the velocity.

I think the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q v × d )/(4π (d² c² - (v·d)² ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² |d| - v·d) )

But none of the options seem to match exactly. Looking at option C:

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

Which can be written as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

So if I compare with what I derived earlier for A being (μ₀ q v)/(4π |d| ), that's different from option C's A.

But in our earlier consideration, the vector potential A should be due to the current, which involves velocity v. So perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the units, option C's V has units of C/m, which can't be right. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the denominator in the vector potential is (c |d| - v·d ), which is a scalar. So with that, option C's A has units:

(μ₀ q c v ) / ( (c |d| - v·d) )

μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²). q is C, c is m/s, v is m/s. Denominator is m²/s.

So,

Numerator: (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → kg·m * C * m²/(s⁴·A²) )

Wait, C is A·s, so substituting:

kg·m * (A·s) * m²/(s⁴·A²) ) → (kg m^3 )/(s^3 A )

Denominator: (m²/s )

So overall units for A would be (kg m^3/(s^3 A )) ) / (m²/s ) → (kg m/(s^2 A) )

Which is the same as (kg·m²/(s³·A)) ) * (1/m) → not sure. Alternatively, the unit for A should be T·m (tesla·meter), which is (kg/(s²·A)) * m → kg·m/(s²·A).

Which matches the above calculation. So yes, the units of option C’s A are correct.

So, putting it all together, option C's V has the incorrect units, but the A is correct. But wait, earlier I thought option C's V had units of C/m, which is wrong. But perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Wait, option C's V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

q has units C, c is m/s, denominator is (m·m/s – (m²/s) ), which is (m²/s – m²/s ) → m²/s.

So V has units (C * m/s ) / (m²/s ) → (C m/s ) * (s/m² ) → C/(m ), which is incorrect.

Ah, so option C's V is wrong, but A is correct. So perhaps that's not the correct option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. Another approach: The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B through B = ∇ × A. For a moving charge, the B field is (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × (r - r')/ |r - r’|³ )

So, in terms of vector d, B = (μ₀ q v × d )/(4π |d|³ )

But A is found by integrating B. Hmm, but perhaps I can express A in terms of velocity and position.

Wait, the vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (d ) / ( |d|² (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² |d| - v·d) )

Which matches option C's A if c is included.

Option C: A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

So if the correct A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² |d| - v·d) ), then none of the options match. But perhaps I'm missing a factor of c.

Wait, another thought: The potentials are often expressed with a 1/c² factor when considering Maxwell's equations. So perhaps the denominator in A includes c², but the options have it as c in the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct vector potential is (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² (c |d| - v·d) ) )

Hmm, this is getting too tangled.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because when the charge is moving, the scalar potential V would have the form (q c)/(4πε₀ ( c |d| - v·d )) and the vector potential A would have a term involving μ₀ q c v divided by the same denominator.

But I'm not entirely confident. Looking back, the correct expressions for moving charges have both V and A involving terms that account for the motion, so in the denominator, it's (c² |d| − v·d).

So in V, it should be (q)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

Looking at the options, option C has (c |d| - v·d) in the denominator, which suggests that their V is missing a factor of c. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the choices, perhaps I should go with option C.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the problem using the given options and the principles of electrodynamics. The charge is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is influenced by the charge's motion. It is generally expressed as:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{c^2 |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}
     \]
     where \( |\vec{d}| \) is the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \), and \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \) accounts for the projection of \( \vec{v} \) onto \( \vec{d} \).
   - Among the options, **Option C** matches this form, with \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})} \). However, the inclusion of an extra factor of \( c \) in the numerator is inconsistent with the standard expression. Despite this, Option C aligns most closely with the expected form.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity and depends on the same denominator as \( V \). The general form is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{c^2 |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}
     \]
   - For **Option C**, the vector potential is given as:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}
     \]
     This matches the expected form if the extra factor of \( c \) is accepted, similar to the scalar potential.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The scalar potential \( V \) does not match the expected form for a moving charge, and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is not consistent with the standard expressions.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. While the scalar potential \( V \) matches the static case, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not account for the full dynamics of a moving charge.
   - **Option C:** Matches the expected forms for both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), except for an extra factor of \( c \) in the numerator. This discrepancy is noted but does not invalidate the overall correctness of the option.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect. The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a plus sign (\( c |\vec{d}| + \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \)), which is unphysical for a moving charge.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the closest match to the expected expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving charge, despite the minor discrepancy in the extra factor of \( c \). Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I remember that when a point charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields, and these are described by the scalar and vector potentials. The question is asking for the expressions of these potentials at a certain time and position.

The setup is that the charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the field at point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So the distance between those points is d, I think. The velocity of the charge at the generating time tr is v.

Wait, the potentials are to be found at time t, where t is greater than tr. So t is after the charge emitted the field that we're observing. I remember that in electrodynamics, the potentials have retarded time dependence because the fields propagate at the speed of light.

The scalar potential V is usually related to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. The formulas I know are:

The electric field E is given by the negative gradient of V minus the time derivative of A. But wait, the potentials themselves depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

For the scalar potential V, I think it's (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by some factor. Oh right, the scalar potential from a moving charge should account for the displacement current or something? Or does it just depend on the charge's position at the retarded time?

Wait, no. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) would be [q/(4πε₀)] * (1/|r - r’|), where r’ is the position of the charge at time tr. But in this problem, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - r’(tr). So the magnitude is |d|, which we can denote as just d if d is a vector.

Then V would be (q/(4πε₀ d)). Wait, but wait, in the options, some have terms like (d c - d·v), which might come from the Lorentz contraction or something considering the motion.

Wait, no, maybe the scalar potential isn't modified by the motion of the charge, only the vector potential. Because the scalar potential is mainly due to the electric charge, while the vector potential is due to the current.

Wait, but when the charge is moving, its velocity contributes to the magnetic field. So for the vector potential A, the expression would involve the velocity of the charge.

The standard expression for the vector potential from a moving charge is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function. But I need to think about the exact form.

I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (r - r')) / (|r - r’|²) or something like that. Or wait, I might be mixing it up with the magnetic field formula. Let me recall: The vector potential due to a moving charge is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (something). Or perhaps it's (μ₀ q v × r)/(4π c² something).

Wait, another approach: The potentials are given by the Lienard potentials. Oh, right, when you have a charge in motion, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/(d) times some correction involving the velocity? Or is it just 1/d? Hmm.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d - (v · d)/c² )) or something like that. Because the charge's velocity introduces a sort of Lorentz contraction effect. Similarly, the vector potential A would involve the velocity multiplied by similar factors.

Alternatively, maybe the scalar potential is the static one, and the vector potential has a term involving the velocity.

Let me think of the general expressions. The potentials are:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ (1/|r - r'|) ] at the retarded time tr, but considering the time it takes for the field to reach r. Wait, but in terms of the vector d, which is r - r’(tr), so |d| is the distance. So V would be ( q )/(4πε₀ |d| ) multiplied by some factor, possibly 1/(1 - (v·d)/c²) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c² (something)).

Wait, in the context of special relativity, the expression for potentials might involve a Lorentz factor. The correction would come from the fact that the charge's velocity affects the field's propagation.

I think the exact expressions for the potentials are:

V(r, t) = [ q ] / [4πε₀ (d - (v · d)/c² ) ]

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's (d c² - v · d) in the denominator. Let me think: The denominator could be (d c² - v · d), which simplifies to d(c² - v²/c²) if v is perpendicular, but that might not be the case.

Wait, wait, another thought: The potentials are calculated using the retarded time, and the expressions involve terms like 1/(d - (v · d)/c² ). That is, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - r'(tr). Then, the denominator becomes d c² - v · d, but only when multiplied by c² perhaps.

Wait, let me get the exact expressions. I think the scalar potential V is [ q ] / [4πε₀ (d c - v · d) ] multiplied by 1/c, perhaps? Or not. Let me think about units.

Alternatively, I remember that the potentials are:

V(r, t) = ( q / (4πε₀) ) * [ (γ) / |r - βγ r’| ] where β = v/c, γ is the Lorentz factor. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the form of the potentials for a moving charge. The vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (1/(something))).

Wait, another approach: The problem states that the options are in terms of d and v. Let me look at the options.

Option C: V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), which seems to have units of [charge] * [velocity] / [distance], but let's check the units.

Wait, units might help. Let me think: The scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is joules per coulomb (J/C). The denominator in the options must have units of meters.

Looking at option B:

V = q/(4πε₀ r), which has units of (C) / (m * ε₀). Since ε₀ has units of F/m (farads per meter), which is (C²·s²)/(kg·m³). So 1/(ε₀) has units kg·m³/(C²·s²). So V (option B) has units (C * kg·m³/(C²·s² * m)) ) = kg·m²/(C s²), which is (kg·m²)/(C·s²). But the unit for V should be volts, which is (kg·m²)/(C·s³). Hmm, so perhaps option B's units are off. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let's compute V in option B: [V] = [q]/([4πε₀] [r]). [q] is Coulombs (C). [ε₀] is F/m (C²/(N·m²)) ). So 1/ε₀ is N·m²/C². So [V] = C * (N·m²/C²) / m ) → C * (N·m²/(C² m)) ) → (N·m²/C ) / m → N·m²/(C m) → N·m/(C). Since N·m is J, so [V] = J/C → Volts, which is correct. So option B's units are correct. But is the expression correct?

Wait, but in reality, the scalar potential for a moving charge is more complicated than just 1/r. So, option B is probably incorrect because it's the same as the static case, but the charge is moving, so there might be a correction.

Looking at option C:

V = qc/(4πε₀ (d c – v·d)). Let's check the units. numerator: q (C) * c (m/s) → C·m/s. denominator: (m * m/s – (m/s)·m ) → (m²/s). So denominator is m²/s.

So overall, V has units (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = (C) / m. But volts are (J/C) → (C·m²/(s³·C)) ) → m²/(s³). So option C's V has units C/m, which is not volts. That can't be right. So option C might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me recalculate.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - ... )).

Wait, [V] is (q * c) / [ε₀ (d c - ... )].

But [ε₀] is F/m → C²/(N·m²) → (C²·s²)/(kg·m³).

So [V] = [q] [c] / ( [ε₀] [d] [c] )

= (C)(m/s) / ( (C² s²)/(kg m³) ) * m * (m/s) )

Wait, denominator: [ε₀] [d] [c] → (C² s²)/(kg m³) ) * m * (m/s) → (C² s² m²)/(kg m³ s) ) → (C² s)/(kg m )

So overall, [V] = (C m/s ) / ( (C² s)/(kg m) )) → (kg m²)/(C s²), which is (kg m²)/(C s³ * s) → wait, no, let me compute the units properly.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. An alternative is to think that the denominator in option C is (d c - v·d), which is a scalar. So the denominator is in meters*(m/s) minus (m/s)*m → m²/s.

So the denominator is m²/s.

Numerator is q*c → C*(m/s).

So V = [ (C m/s) ] / [ (m²/s) ) ] → (C m/s) * (s/m²) → C/(m). Which is C/m, which isn't volts. So option C can't be correct.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps none of the options have the correct units? That can't be. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is J/C. J is kg·m²/s². So V = kg·m²/(C·s³).

Looking at option D:

V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + v·d)).

Same as option C but with a plus sign. Let's compute the units.

Numerator: q * c → C*(m/s).

Denominator: (d c + v·d) → d is m, c is m/s, v is m/s, d·v is m²/s.

So denominator is (m*(m/s) ) + (m²/s ) → m²/s + m²/s → same units, m²/s.

So denominator is m²/s.

So V's units: (C m/s) / (m²/s) ) → (C m/s) * (s)/(m²) ) → C/(m). Again, C/m, which is wrong. So options C and D have V in wrong units.

Option A: V = q/(4πε₀ r ), which is same as option B but without velocity. So units are correct as I saw earlier. But I thought moving charge's potential is different.

Option B: V is same as static case; vector A is (v/c²) times V. So A would have units (m/s) * (V) → (m/s)(J/C) → (kg·m²/(C·s³)) * (m/s) → kg·m³/(C·s⁴). The unit for A is Tesla·m² or something? Wait, vector potential A has units of Tesla·meter²? Or let me think: The unit of A is Weber per meter (Wb/m), since B is Wb/m². But Weber is V·s, so Wb/m = (V·s)/m → (J·s/C)/m → (kg·m²/(s³·C)) · s / m → kg·m/(s²·C) → which is same as (kg·m²)/(s³·C) ) × (1/m) ) → kg·m/(s³·C). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

But looking at option B: V is correct in units, but vector A is (v/c²) times V. Let's see: vector A would have units (m/s) * (V) → (m/s)(J/C) → (kg·m²/(C·s³)) * (m/s) ) → kg·m³/(C·s⁴). But the correct unit for A is (kg·m²)/(C·s³). So option B's vector A has units kg·m³/(C·s⁴) which is kg·m/(C·s³), which is not matching. So option B is wrong.

Hmm, so what's left? Option A: V is static, A is v^2/c² * V. Let me check A's units.

Option A: A = (v²/c²) * V. So v is m/s, so v² is m²/s². c² is m²/s². So v²/c² is dimensionless. So A would have same units as V, which is volts. But A should have units of (kg·m²)/(C·s³). So option A is wrong, as A has same units as V, which is volts, but vector potential's units are different.

Wait, but I think I'm getting tangled in the units. Maybe I should think about the expressions more conceptually.

The general expressions for the potentials for a moving charge are:

The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (|d| (1 - (v·d)/(c²|d|)) ) ].

Wait, because the denominator becomes |d| ( 1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|) ) ), which can be written as |d| - (v·d)/c². But since d is a vector, maybe it's better to express as sqrt( (|d|)^2 - (v·d)^2/c^4 )? Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d) / c². So 1/(denominator) would be c²/(c² |d| - v·d), making V = (q c²)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d)).

But wait, in terms of vector d, which has magnitude |d|, but d·v is a scalar. So the denominator isn't a vector, it's a scalar quantity.

So perhaps V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d)).

Wait, because if |d| is the distance, and v·d is the projection of v onto d multiplied by |d|. So c |d| is distance times c, and v·d is velocity times |d| in the direction of d.

So putting it together, the denominator would be (c |d| - v·d), and the numerator is q c, so V would look like option C or D.

Looking at option C: V = (q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)).

But wait, d is a vector, so in the denominator, they're using d c, which is a vector multiplied by c, but in the expression, it's probably scalar. Hmm, but the problem states that the denominator is (d c − vec{d}⋅vec{v}), which is a scalar since both terms are scalars.

Wait, the problem says the denominator is (d c − vec{d} ⋅ vec{v}), which is the same as c |d| − v·d if d is the vector from the charge to the field point, and |d| is the magnitude. So in that case, V would be [ q c ] / [4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) ].

Which matches the form of option C. So option C's V is correct.

Then, the vector potential A. I think the vector potential is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d')/( (c^2 |d| - v·d) ), where d' is a certain vector.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector potential A is (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × (d / (c² |d| - v·d) )) ), or something like that. Because A is related to the velocity and the displacement.

Wait, another thought: The vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (d ) / ( (c² |d| ) - v·d )^2 ? Or perhaps it's (d × v)/(something).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the expressions again. The vector potential is usually given as A = (μ₀ I)/(4π) × something. For a point charge, the current is the charge times velocity, so I would be q v.

So perhaps A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) multiplied by (d ) divided by (c² |d| - v·d) in some fashion.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is [μ₀ q c v ]/(4π (d c - v·d) )

Wait, so [μ₀ q c v ] / denominator.

Wait, but the denominator is (d c - v·d), which is same as (c |d| - v·d) if d is the vector pointing from the charge to r. Because d·v is v·d, which is the projection of v onto d.

So the denominator is (c |d| - v·d) as a scalar.

So the vector A in option C is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

But wait, the denominator is (d c - ... ), but that's a vector. Oh wait, no, the denominator is written as (d c - d·v), which is a scalar because d is a vector, but (d c) is a vector times a scalar, so that term is a vector, and (d·v) is a scalar. So that would make the denominator a vector minus a scalar. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, the problem says the denominator is (d c − vec{d} ⋅ vec{v}), which is a scalar. Because d is a vector, but d c is a vector multiplied by c, making it a vector. But vec{d} ⋅ vec{v} is scalar. So the denominator is a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem statement uses d as the scalar distance, not the vector. Wait, let me read the question again.

The question says: the vector d is from the field generating point to r. So d is a vector, and |d| is its magnitude. So the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v), which would be a vector (d multiplied by c) minus a scalar (d·v). That can't be right because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Ah, so perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, the denominator is ( |d| c - (d·v) ), which is a scalar. So perhaps in the options, the denominator should be ( |d| c - (d·v) ), which would make sense.

But looking at the options, option C's denominator is (d c - d·v ), which is vector minus scalar. So that can't be correct. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the term (d c) is actually |d| c. Because otherwise, the denominator isn't a scalar, which is necessary for the potentials to be scalars. So perhaps the options have a mistake. But given the options, I have to choose the best one.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d), which is a scalar. So in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d·v ), which is not correct. So perhaps the correct option isn't among the ones presented, but considering the options given, perhaps option C is the intended one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about when v is zero, the potentials should reduce to their static forms. So when v=0, V should be q/(4πε₀ r), and A should be zero.

Looking at the options:
- Option B: V is correct, A is (v/c²) V. When v=0, A=0. So in that case, option B would be correct when charge is stationary. But when the charge is moving, the potentials should change.

Wait, but for a stationary charge, the potentials are static. So option B would be correct for a static case. But the question is about a moving charge, so option B can't be the correct general case.

So, perhaps the correct potentials are when V is (q)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think of the Lienard potentials, which describe the fields of an accelerating charge. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/|r - r(t_r)| ] / (1 - (v·(r - r(t_r)) ) / c² |r - r(t_r)| )

But in terms of d, which is r - r(t_r), so |d| = |r - r(t_r)|.

So V becomes (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d|) ) )

= (q/(4πε₀)) * |d| / ( c² |d| - v·d )

= (q |d| )/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

= (q / (4πε₀)) * (1/(c² - (v·d)/|d|² ) ) * (1/|d| )

= Not quite, perhaps not directly matching the options.

Wait, maybe factor out |d| from the denominator:

c² |d| - v·d = |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| )

But (v·d)/|d| is the projection of v in the direction of d, which is v cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

So, V = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/ ( |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| ) )

= q/(4πε₀ |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d|) )

= q/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

So in terms of vector d, since |d| is the magnitude of d, c² |d| - v·d is a scalar. So V is (q )/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

Looking at the options, option C has V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

Wait, so the denominator is c |d| - v·d, and the numerator is q c.

Which would make V = q c / [4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) ]

But according to the Lienard expression, V is q/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

So the denominator in option C has a c factor in the first term. So that's different.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps none of the options perfectly match the Lienard expression. But perhaps it's a matter of scaling.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me double-check.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( |r - r'(t_r)| ) ] / [ 1 - (v(t_r) · (r - r'(t_r)) )/( c² |r - r'(t_r)|² ) ]

Wait, no, that's not right. The denominator is 1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| ), where d is r - r'. So the expression is:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ]

= q/(4πε₀) * 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) )

= q/(4πε₀) * (c² |d| ) / ( c² |d|² - v·d |d| )

Wait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the denominator as (c² |d| - v·d) in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should factor out |d| from the denominator:

Denominator: c² |d| - v·d = |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| )

So,

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| (c² - (v·d)/|d| ) ) ]

= (q/(4πε₀ |d| )) * (1/(c² - (v·d)/|d| )) 

Which can be rewritten as (q/(4πε₀ |d| )) * ( |d|/(c² |d| - v·d) )

So,

V = q/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

So, the denominator is (c² |d| - v·d )

Comparing with the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option C:

V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

But the denominator here is (c |d| - v·d ), which is different from (c² |d| - v·d )

So perhaps the correct expression isn't among the options. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Lienard formula. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm not confident about the exact expressions, so perhaps I should think of the vector potential.

The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v(t_r) )/(4π) * [ (d × (v(t_r)/c² )) + (d × (d × (v(t_r)/c² )) )/( |d|² (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) ) ) ]

Wait, no, that seems too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π) times something.

Wait, another approach: The vector potential is related to the current density J. For a point charge moving with velocity v, the current density is J = q v δ³(r - r’), where r’ is the charge's position.

The vector potential is A(r,t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ ( J(r', t_r) / |r - r’| ) dr'

So in this case, J(r', t_r) is q v δ³(r - r’(t_r) )

So,

A(r,t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) ∫ [ δ³(r - r’(t_r) ) / |r - r’| ] dr'

= (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * 1/|d|

Because the integral of δ³(r - r’) times 1/|r - r’| is 1/|d|.

So A(r,t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π |d| )

But wait, that can't be correct because the vector potential depends on the direction as well. Hmm, perhaps that's only the case when the charge is at rest. When it's moving, the expression changes.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the expression in terms of the vector d and the velocity.

I think the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q v × d )/(4π (d² c² - (v·d)² ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² |d| - v·d) )

But none of the options seem to match exactly. Looking at option C:

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

Which can be written as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

So if I compare with what I derived earlier for A being (μ₀ q v)/(4π |d| ), that's different from option C's A.

But in our earlier consideration, the vector potential A should be due to the current, which involves velocity v. So perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the units, option C's V has units of C/m, which can't be right. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the denominator in the vector potential is (c |d| - v·d ), which is a scalar. So with that, option C's A has units:

(μ₀ q c v ) / ( (c |d| - v·d) )

μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²). q is C, c is m/s, v is m/s. Denominator is m²/s.

So,

Numerator: (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → kg·m * C * m²/(s⁴·A²) )

Wait, C is A·s, so substituting:

kg·m * (A·s) * m²/(s⁴·A²) ) → (kg m^3 )/(s^3 A )

Denominator: (m²/s )

So overall units for A would be (kg m^3/(s^3 A )) ) / (m²/s ) → (kg m/(s^2 A) )

Which is the same as (kg·m²/(s³·A)) ) * (1/m) → not sure. Alternatively, the unit for A should be T·m (tesla·meter), which is (kg/(s²·A)) * m → kg·m/(s²·A).

Which matches the above calculation. So yes, the units of option C’s A are correct.

So, putting it all together, option C's V has the incorrect units, but the A is correct. But wait, earlier I thought option C's V had units of C/m, which is wrong. But perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Wait, option C's V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (c |d| - v·d) )

q has units C, c is m/s, denominator is (m·m/s – (m²/s) ), which is (m²/s – m²/s ) → m²/s.

So V has units (C * m/s ) / (m²/s ) → (C m/s ) * (s/m² ) → C/(m ), which is incorrect.

Ah, so option C's V is wrong, but A is correct. So perhaps that's not the correct option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. Another approach: The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B through B = ∇ × A. For a moving charge, the B field is (μ₀ q)/(4π) (v × (r - r')/ |r - r’|³ )

So, in terms of vector d, B = (μ₀ q v × d )/(4π |d|³ )

But A is found by integrating B. Hmm, but perhaps I can express A in terms of velocity and position.

Wait, the vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (d ) / ( |d|² (1 - (v·d)/(c² |d| )) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² |d| - v·d) )

Which matches option C's A if c is included.

Option C: A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - v·d) )

So if the correct A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² |d| - v·d) ), then none of the options match. But perhaps I'm missing a factor of c.

Wait, another thought: The potentials are often expressed with a 1/c² factor when considering Maxwell's equations. So perhaps the denominator in A includes c², but the options have it as c in the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct vector potential is (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c² (c |d| - v·d) ) )

Hmm, this is getting too tangled.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because when the charge is moving, the scalar potential V would have the form (q c)/(4πε₀ ( c |d| - v·d )) and the vector potential A would have a term involving μ₀ q c v divided by the same denominator.

But I'm not entirely confident. Looking back, the correct expressions for moving charges have both V and A involving terms that account for the motion, so in the denominator, it's (c² |d| − v·d).

So in V, it should be (q)/(4πε₀ (c² |d| - v·d) )

Looking at the options, option C has (c |d| - v·d) in the denominator, which suggests that their V is missing a factor of c. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the choices, perhaps I should go with option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the problem using the given options and the principles of electrodynamics. The charge is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is influenced by the charge's motion. It is generally expressed as:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{c^2 |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}
     \]
     where \( |\vec{d}| \) is the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \), and \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \) accounts for the projection of \( \vec{v} \) onto \( \vec{d} \).
   - Among the options, **Option C** matches this form, with \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})} \). However, the inclusion of an extra factor of \( c \) in the numerator is inconsistent with the standard expression. Despite this, Option C aligns most closely with the expected form.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity and depends on the same denominator as \( V \). The general form is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{c^2 |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}
     \]
   - For **Option C**, the vector potential is given as:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}
     \]
     This matches the expected form if the extra factor of \( c \) is accepted, similar to the scalar potential.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The scalar potential \( V \) does not match the expected form for a moving charge, and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is not consistent with the standard expressions.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. While the scalar potential \( V \) matches the static case, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not account for the full dynamics of a moving charge.
   - **Option C:** Matches the expected forms for both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), except for an extra factor of \( c \) in the numerator. This discrepancy is noted but does not invalidate the overall correctness of the option.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect. The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a plus sign (\( c |\vec{d}| + \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \)), which is unphysical for a moving charge.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the closest match to the expected expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving charge, despite the minor discrepancy in the extra factor of \( c \). Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.
