Okay, so I have this question about quasars and their observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. Hmm, let me try to unpack it. So the question is talking about a quasar observed in near infrared and optical spectrum, with a peak at 790 nm and flux dropping below that. Wait, I think that the peak around 790 nm might be related to some emission line. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is at about 121 nm, but when redshifted, it can move into the optical or infrared range.

Wait, but wait. The Lyman-alpha line is emitted by neutral hydrogen. If the quasar is at a high redshift, that line would be shifted into longer wavelengths. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's longer than 700 nm, so that would mean a significant redshift. Let me think: the rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. So if it's observed at 790 nm, the redshift z would be (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) -1. So z = (790 / 121.6) -1. Let me compute that: 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5, so z is about 5.5. Hmm, wait, 121.6 *6.5 is around 790. So yes, z is about 5.5.

So the quasar is at a redshift of approximately 5.5. Now the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a way to measure the distance to an object in an expanding universe. The formula for comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters, which are given here as the Lambda-CDM model. The current Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Omega_m is 0.3, dark energy density parameter Omega_lambda is 0.7, and the universe is flat (Omega_total =1).

So I need to calculate the comoving distance D_C for a redshift z=5.5. The comoving distance formula is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Wait, but actually, since the universe is flat, and with only matter and dark energy (assuming no radiation at z=5.5, which is high), so E(z) = sqrt( (Omega_m*(1+z)^3) + (Omega_lambda) )

So the integral is from 0 to z of 1 / sqrt( (0.3*(1+z')^3) + 0.7 ) dz'. But integrating this exactly is a bit tricky. I think I remember that for high redshifts, the dark energy term (the cosmological constant) starts to dominate, so the expansion history is affected by dark energy more as z increases. Wait, but at z=5.5, the matter density is higher, because (1+z)^3 for z=5.5 is (6.5)^3 = 274.625, so Omega_m*(1+z)^3 is 0.3 * 274.625 = about 82.4, which is way bigger than Omega_lambda (0.7). So at z=5.5, matter dominates, right? So E(z) is sqrt(82.4 + 0.7 ) = sqrt(83.1) ≈ 9.116. So the integrand is 1/9.116 ≈ 0.1097.

But wait, the integrand isn't a constant, because z' varies from 0 to 5.5. Wait, no, if z is 5.5, does E(z') change significantly with z'? For instance, at z=0, E(0) is sqrt(0.3 + 0.7) = sqrt(1) =1. So the integrand starts at 1, then as z' increases, E(z') increases. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact integral. Maybe I can use an approximation or look up a table of comoving distances for standard cosmological parameters.

Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe at z=5.5. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral numerically, but that's a bit time-consuming without a calculator. Alternatively, I can remember that for the standard Lambda-CDM model (H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7), the comoving distance at z=1 is about 1.4 billion light-years, but that's not in Gpc. Wait, no, that's probably not the right approach.

Wait, let me think about the relation between redshift and comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is given by (c / H0) * ∫ (0 to z) dz' / E(z'). So for H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So (c/H0) is (3e5)/(70) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. Wait, yes, because 3e5 divided by 70 is approximately 4285.7. So (c/H0) is about 4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.2857 Gpc.

Then, the integral part is the integral from 0 to 5.5 of 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) dz'.

Wait, so I can model this as approximately the integral of 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7) dz' from 0 to 5.5. Hmm.

But integrating this exactly is complicated. Alternatively, I can use an approximation or a standard table. I think in the standard Lambda-CDM model, the comoving distance for z=5.5 is around 13 Gpc, but wait, that doesn't make sense because in the given options the maximum is 9 Gpc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For the given cosmological parameters, the Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc. The comoving distance is D_C = (c/H0)* ∫ (0 to z) dz' / E(z'). So, with (c/H0) = 4285.7 Mpc, and the integral is a dimensionless number.

I think that for a matter-dominated universe (Omega_m=1, Omega_lambda=0), the integral would be (1 + z)^-0.5, so ∫0^z (1+z')^-1.5 dz' which is 2*(1 - (1+z)^-0.5 ). So for z=5.5, it would be 2*(1 - 1/sqrt(6.5)) ≈ 2*(1 - 0.3922) ≈ 2*0.6078 ≈ 1.2156. So D_C would be 4285.7 * 1.2156 ≈ 5217 Mpc, or about 5.2 Gpc.

But in our case, Omega_lambda is 0.7, so dark energy is significant. So the expansion is faster, which makes the integral smaller. Wait, because E(z) is larger, so 1/E(z) is smaller, so the integral is smaller. So the comoving distance would be less than 5.2 Gpc. Hmm, but wait. For a universe with dark energy, the expansion accelerates, which increases the comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe at high redshifts. Wait, actually, no, that's not right. Wait, at high z, matter dominates, so perhaps the situation is a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up approximate comoving distances for a given redshift. From my notes, for z=1, in this cosmology, D_C is about 2 Gpc. For z=2, it's about 7 Gpc. Oh wait, that's in the 7 Gpc range. So for z=5.5, which is higher than 2, the comoving distance would be more than 7 Gpc.

Wait, but wait, another approach. The age of the universe at z=5.5 is about 1.5 billion years, but I'm not sure how that ties into the comoving distance.

Alternatively, perhaps for z=5.5, the comoving distance is about 7 Gpc. So looking at the options, option D is 7 Gpc.

Wait, but wait, another way. The Hubble parameter H0 is 70, and the comoving distance is roughly (c/H0) * (1+z) / sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). But that's an approximation.

Wait, let's evaluate E(z=5.5) = sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.3 * 274.625 + 0.7) = sqrt(82.3875 +0.7)= sqrt(83.0875)= approximately 9.116. So 1/E(z) is about 0.1097.

But the integral is from 0 to 5.5 of 1/E(z') dz'. Hmm, but the integral isn't just 1/E(z) * z, because E(z) varies with z. So maybe I can approximate the integral as the average value multiplied by the redshift. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the comoving distance in terms of lookback time. No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using an online calculator or a standard formula. But since I can't access external resources, I'll have to proceed with what I know.

Wait, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance. For Omega_m =0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * [ (1 + (1 + q0)/2 * z ) / sqrt( (1+z)^3 + (0.7/0.3) ) ) ] ?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I think that for a flat universe, the integral can be expressed as:

∫ dz' / sqrt( [Omega_m (1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda] ) from 0 to z.

But I'm not sure of the exact approach. Another way: I've heard that the comoving distance for high z in this model is approximately D_C ≈ 3000 (1 + z) / (1 + 0.7) Mpc? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for the given cosmology, the comoving distance at z=1 is about 1.5 Gpc, z=2 is about 3 Gpc, and so on. Wait, no, that seems too low. Wait, no, that's not correct because earlier calculations suggested for z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc, and for z=2 it's about 3 Gpc. Wait, but that's not matching with the earlier example.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the Hubble parameter. The Hubble distance is c/H0 = about 14.1 billion light-years, which is about 4280 Mpc or 4.28 Gpc. The comoving distance at high z should be higher than this because the expansion has been happening for a longer time.

Wait, but wait. No, the Hubble distance is the distance to an object receding at the current Hubble flow, which is about 4.28 Gpc. So for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be larger than 4.28 Gpc because the object is at a higher redshift. So the options given are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

Wait, the options are 6,8,9,7 Gpc. So if I thought that for z=2, D_C is around 7 Gpc, then for z=5.5, which is higher, the comoving distance would be larger than 7 Gpc. But the options include 8,9, etc.

So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Another approach: I can use the approximation formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

The comoving distance is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z dz' / sqrt( Omega_m (1 + z')^3 + Omega_lambda )

I can approximate the integral numerically. Let me try to compute it step by step. Let's break the integral into intervals.

But this is going to take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate value. From what I remember, the comoving distance for z=5.5 in the given cosmology is around 7 Gpc. So the answer would be option D)7 Gpc.

Wait, but earlier thinking suggested that if I model it as a matter-dominated universe, D_C would be about 5 Gpc, but with dark energy, E(z) is higher, leading to a lower integrand, so the integral would be smaller, but wait, no. Because for high z, matter dominates, so E(z) is ~ sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). So the integrand is approximately 1/sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^-1.5.

Wait, let's compute the integral for high z. For z=5.5, the integrand for small z' is about 1/sqrt(0.3 + 0.7) = 1, and for larger z', it's 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7). So for z' much larger than 1, the integrand approaches 1/sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^-1.5.

Wait, but integrating from 0 to 5.5. So the integral is roughly split into two parts: where z' is small (z' <<1) and where z' approaches 5.5. Let's approximate the integral as the sum of two parts.

First part: z' from 0 to 1. Here, the integrand is about 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7). At z'=0, it's 1. At z'=1, 0.3*(2)^3=2.4, so E(z')=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.761. So the integrand is about 0.567.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it numerically in segments.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for z much larger than 1, the integrand is about 1/sqrt(0.3) * (1+z')^-1.5, which is approximately 1.826*(1+z')^-1.5.

So the integral for z from 0 to 5.5 would be roughly the sum of the integral from 0 to 1, and the integral from 1 to 5.5, each approximated.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is about 1.826 times the integral of (1+z')^-1.5 from 0 to 5.5.

The integral of (1+z')^-1.5 dz' is [2 (1 + z')^(-0.5)] from 0 to 5.5.

So that's 2*(1/sqrt(6.5) -1) ≈ 2*(0.3922 -1) = 2*(-0.6078) = -1.2156. But since we're integrating positive values, perhaps taking the absolute value, 1.2156.

So the integral from 1 to 5.5 is about 1.2156. Then, the integral from 0 to 1 is a bit more involved. Let me approximate it as the average value times the interval. From z'=0 to 1:

E(z') varies from 1 to sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7) = sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.761.

So the integrand varies from 1 to 0.567. The average would be approximately (1 + 0.567)/2 = 0.7835. So the integral from 0 to 1 is approximately 0.7835 * 1 = 0.7835.

So total integral is 0.7835 + 1.826*(1.2156) ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I got confused. Let me re-express.

The integral from 0 to 5.5 of 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) dz' can be approximated as:

Integral from 0 to 1: Let's approximate it numerically. Let's take z'=0, 0.5, 1.

At z'=0: integrand=1.

z'=0.5: E= sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*3.375 +0.7)=sqrt(1.0125 +0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=~1.309. So integrand= ~0.764.

z'=1: integrand=0.567.

So the average over 0 to 1 is approximately (1 + 0.764 +0.567)/3 ≈ 2.331/3 ≈ 0.777. So the integral from 0 to 1 is about 0.777.

Then, from z'=1 to 5.5:

We approximate using the high-z approximation where E(z') ≈ sqrt(0.3)*(1+z')^1.5.

So the integrand is 1/(sqrt(0.3)*(1+z')^1.5) ) = 1/(0.5477) * (1+z')^-1.5 ≈ 1.826*(1+z')^-1.5.

So the integral from 1 to 5.5 is 1.826 * ∫ (1 to 5.5) (1+z')^-1.5 dz'.

The integral of (1+z')^-1.5 dz' is [2/(1 + z')^0.5 ] from 1 to 5.5.

At z'=5.5: 2/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 2/2.55 ≈ 0.784.

At z'=1: 2/sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142.

So the integral is 0.784 - 1.4142 = -0.6302. Taking absolute value, it's 0.6302.

Multiply by 1.826: 1.826 *0.6302 ≈ 1.153.

So the total integral is approx 0.777 (from 0-1) +1.153 (from 1-5.5) = 1.93.

So D_C = (c/H0) * 1.93 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc * 1.93 ≈ 8281 Mpc ≈ 8.28 Gpc.

Wait, that's about 8.3 Gpc. So looking at the options, the closest is option B)8 Gpc.

But wait, I'm not sure if my approximation is correct. Because the high-z approximation may not be perfect for z=5.5, but perhaps. So according to this, the comoving distance is about 8.3 Gpc.

Looking back at the options, option B is 8 Gpc. So I think the answer is B)8 Gpc.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the comoving distance for z=2 is about 7 Gpc. So at z=5.5, it should be more than 7 Gpc, which fits with 8 Gpc.

So the correct answer is B)8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar at redshift \( z \approx 5.5 \) in a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model with the following parameters: Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), matter density parameter \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), dark energy density parameter \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \), and a flat universe (\( \Omega_{\text{total}} = 1 \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Redshift Determination**:  
   The quasar's observed peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha emission line, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm. The redshift is calculated as:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.5
   \]

2. **Comoving Distance Formula**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}}
   \]  
   where \( c \) is the speed of light. Using \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), the factor \( \frac{c}{H_0} \) is approximately \( 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc} \) or \( 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \).

3. **Integral Approximation**:  
   The integral depends on the expansion history of the universe, governed by \( E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\lambda} \). At \( z = 5.5 \), matter dominates (\( \Omega_m (1+z)^3 \gg \Omega_\lambda \)), so \( E(z) \approx \sqrt{0.3 (1+z)^3} \). The integrand \( 1/E(z) \) decreases with redshift, and the integral is computed numerically by breaking it into regions where \( z' \) is small (matter-dominated) and large (dark energy dominates).

4. **Numerical Approximation**:  
   - For \( z' \) near 0, the integrand transitions from 1 to values as low as \( \sim 0.567 \) at \( z' = 1 \).  
   - For \( z' \) between 1 and 5.5, the integrand follows \( 1/E(z') \approx 1.826 (1+z')^{-1.5} \).  
   - The integral is approximated as \( \sim 1.93 \) (dimensionless).

5. **Final Comoving Distance**:  
   Substituting the integral result into the formula:  
   \[
   D_C = 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc} \times 1.93 \approx 8281 \, \text{Mpc} \approx 8.3 \, \text{Gpc}.
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The computed comoving distance of \( \sim 8.3 \, \text{Gpc} \) aligns closely with option **B) 8 Gpc**. This is consistent with the expected scaling of comoving distance with redshift in the given cosmology.

### Conclusion:
The comoving distance of the quasar at \( z \approx 5.5 \) is approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \). 

**Answer: B**
