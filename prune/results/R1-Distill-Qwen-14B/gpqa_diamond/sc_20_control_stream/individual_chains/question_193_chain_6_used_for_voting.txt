Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N = 1/plx^5, I guess? Or maybe it's proportional, so N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So that means r = 1/plx. So if I have r in terms of plx, I can maybe substitute that into the equation.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let's write that as N ∝ plx^(-5). Since r is 1/plx, that means plx = 1/r. Substituting that into the equation, N ∝ (1/r)^-5. Which is the same as N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait a second, that seems a bit counter-intuitive. Because as distance increases, more stars? That doesn't make much sense because usually, stars are more numerous closer by. Like, you can see more nearby stars because they're brighter and more are within your observable range.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the variables here. Let me think again. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So like, if you go a little further, how does the number of stars you observe change?

Wait, the initial relation is given as N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r to the fifth power. But that seems odd because as you look further, you might expect the number of stars to increase but not that rapidly. Or wait, maybe the way the question is framed, it's not about the total number, but the number per unit distance. Hmm, wait no, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The number of stars in a region depends on how much volume you're looking at. The volume of a spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, right? So if the number density is uniform, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So N ∝ r² dr. But that's assuming that the density is uniform. But in this case, the relation is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is r^5. That's a different relation.

So maybe this isn't about a uniform distribution. Perhaps the stars are distributed in a way that the number increases rapidly with distance. But why would that be? Maybe it's a specific region where stars are clustered more at larger distances? Or perhaps the question is more mathematical and less about actual star distribution.

Let me think again about the given relationship. They say the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, then N = k * r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by a factor of r^5. Wait, but that can't be right because for each unit of distance, the number would change by the derivative of N with respect to r.

Oh wait! The question asks how the number of stars in that region changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So perhaps they're asking about the differential change, like the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative dN/dr.

So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to r^4. Because the derivative of r^5 is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the rate) would go as r^4.

Wait, but looking back at the options: the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2. So if the derivative is r^4, then the correct answer would be C) r^4.

Wait, but why would dN/dr be the right approach here? The way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit r, so it's the rate—so dN/dr.

So yes, if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says the number varies with 1/plx^5. So N = k / (plx^5) = k * r^5. So N increases with r^5. But if they're asking how the number changes as a function of r, that's r^5. But the options have B as r^5, which is N ∝ r^5. But the question says "change with distance per unit range of distance." So perhaps they're asking about the rate of change, which is the derivative. So I think I'm right that it's r^4.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check. Since N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, so plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4, so option C.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the equation to express \( N \) in terms of \( r \). This gives:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, \( N \propto r^5 \), meaning the total number of stars increases with \( r^5 \). However, the question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance," which implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), or \( \frac{dN}{dr} \).

To find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), we take the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \):

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( \sim r^4 \)**.
