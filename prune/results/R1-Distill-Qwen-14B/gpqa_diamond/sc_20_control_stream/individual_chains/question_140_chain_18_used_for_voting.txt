Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has an element with a heavier isotope, which probably means that in its structure, one of the elements is present in a heavier form, like maybe deuterium instead of hydrogen or something like that.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that for a molecule, each atom contributes to the total of protons and neutrons. Wait, but W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about common gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, but each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. Maybe another gas. What about CO2? No, that's a gas, but let's calculate. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (since it's C-12), oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 would have (6*2)+(8*2) = 12+16 = 28 protons, and 6*2 +8*2 = same as protons? Wait, no, wait. No, each CO2 molecule would have each atom's protons and neutrons. So carbon contributes 6 p and 6 n, and oxygen contributes 8 p and 8 n each. So each CO2 molecule has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons, and 6 +8*2=22 neutrons. So 22 each. So that's equal. So W could be CO2? Or maybe another gas.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe W is NH3? Let's check. Nitrogen has 7 p and 7 n, hydrogen has 1 p each. So NH3 is N plus 3 H. So total protons:7 +3*1=10. Neutrons:7 +3*0=7. Wait, that's not equal. So no. Hmm.

Another possibility is O2. Each O has 8 p and 8 n. So O2 has 16 p and 16 n. So yes, equal. So O2 could be W. Then, gas W is O2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If W is O2, then the molecule has two atoms. Each O has 8 p and 8 n. So the molecule has 16 p and 16 n. So equal. So that fits. But wait, when X reacts with Y, which is liquid, to produce O2. What reactions produce O2? Maybe a decomposition reaction. Like H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2? But H2O2 is a liquid, and when it decomposes, it produces O2 gas. So Y could be H2O2, and X is a catalyst? Or maybe X is something else.

Wait, but the reaction is violent. Another possibility is a reaction between a metal and acid. For example, metals like sodium reacting with water to produce hydrogen gas. But wait, in that case, W would be H2, but earlier we saw that H2 doesn't have equal p and n. Alternatively, perhaps a reaction that produces O2. Maybe a metal reacting with something to produce O2. But wait, maybe Y is water, and X is a metal that reacts with water violently, producing H2 gas. But then W would not be O2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe W is another gas. Let's think about other possibilities. What about CH4? No, that's a gas, but let's check. C has 6 p, 6 n. Each H has 1 p, 0 n. So CH4 would have 6 +4=10 p, and 6 +0=6 n. Not equal. So no. What about NO? N has 7 p, 7 n; O has 8 p, 8 n. So NO has 15 p, 15 n. So that works. Could W be NO? Nitric oxide. Is that a possible product? When metals react with certain acids, NO could be released, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, right? So B is a solid that melts just above freezing. What substances have a melting point around there? Like water (0°C, 273 K), but B is at 277 K, so about 4°C. Hmm. Could B be something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Or maybe another solid. Wait, maybe B is some kind of metal or a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like paraffin, but I'm not sure.

Wait, after G is heated, B is released. So B is likely a volatile substance. Let me think. What about sodium bicarbonate? When heated, it decomposes to sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, if G is a carbonate salt, upon heating, it might release CO2 and form another compound. Wait, but earlier we thought W could be CO2, but that's if Y is H2O2 and X is something else. Hmm.

Let me try to approach this from another angle. The next part says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something similar. What could X be in this case?

If X is something like a strong base, maybe it's reacting with the keto acid in a neutralization reaction? But then, the product would be a salt. Let's see. Suppose X is NaOH. Then, when a keto acid like acetoacetic acid reacts with NaOH, it would form a sodium salt, acetate, and water. Wait, but the product would have... Let me think. Acetoacetic acid is CH3C(O)CH2COOH. If it reacts with NaOH, it would lose H+ and form the sodium salt. The product would be the sodium salt, which would have the structure: CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+.

Wait, but the product's molecule has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about the product. Maybe it's a simple salt where the anion has two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH), when it reacts with a base, you get HCOO^- Na^+ or similar. So formic acid has two oxygen atoms in the molecule. So maybe the product is something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction is a neutralization, forming a metal salt. But I'm not sure yet.

Another point is that X's analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So X or its analog is a reagent. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, HCl, H2SO4, etc. Wait, but the question says X is used as a reagent, and its analog suggests something similar. So maybe X is a strong base, like NaOH or KOH. Or perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterium oxide), considering the first part about heavier isotopes.

Wait, the first part says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So one of its elements is a heavier isotope. For example, if X is D2O (deuterium oxide), which is heavy water, it would have deuterium (H-2) instead of hydrogen. So each H is replaced by D, which is a heavier isotope. That makes sense. So X could be heavy water, D2O.

Now, if X is D2O, reacting with Y (liquid) violently. What would Y be? If Y is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), then D2O and H2O2 reacting... Wait, but what reaction occurs between heavy water and hydrogen peroxide? I'm not too familiar with that. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another substance.

Wait, another thought: if X is D2O, and Y is something like a strong acid or base. For example, if Y is NaOH, but that's a solid, not a liquid. Or maybe Y is something else, like ethanol. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal, but that's a solid. Wait, maybe Y is something else. Let's think about what a violent reaction would look like. Maybe a reaction with a strong acid, like sulfuric acid. But if X is D2O, maybe it's reacting with a metal to produce H2 gas. For example, Mg reacting with D2O to produce MgO and D2 gas. But wait, that would require Mg to react with D2O, but I'm not sure if that's a common reaction. It might require a lot of energy or a catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid acid like H2SO4. But when D2O reacts with H2SO4, maybe it just becomes H2O and SO4^2-, but that's not a violent reaction. Hmm.

Wait, getting back to the reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (with equal protons and neutrons) and precipitate G. Then, when G is heated, B is released, whose melting point is around 277 K.

If X is D2O, perhaps Y is an acid like H2SO4. Then the reaction would be D2O + H2SO4 → H2O + D2SO4? But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe Y is a salt solution that reacts with D2O to form a precipitate. Or perhaps Y is something else.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution containing a soluble carbonate. For example, if Y is Na2CO3 solution, and X is D2O, but I'm not sure what reaction would occur between them.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B. B's melting point is ~277 K, which is about 4°C. So B is a solid that melts just above 0°C. What's a solid that melts around there? Well, water ice melts at 273 K, which is 0°C. But 277 K is 4°C. Maybe B is something else, like a different form of ice or a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. For example, mercury is a liquid at room temperature, but that's higher than 277 K. Wait, no, mercury's melting point is about 234 K (-40°C). So that's lower than 277 K.

Wait, another approach: The product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So the product is a molecule with two oxygen atoms. If X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the reaction would produce sodium acetate. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COO^- Na^+. The acetate ion is CH3COO^-, which has two oxygen atoms (from the carboxylate group). So that fits: two oxygen atoms in the product.

So if X is NaOH, then reacting it with a keto acid like acetic acid gives sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. That makes sense.

Wait, but earlier we were thinking about X having a heavy isotope. If X is NaOH, then it's made of Na, O, and H. If the heavier isotope is present, perhaps the H is replaced by deuterium. So X would be NaOD or NaOH with some deuterium? Or maybe X is a compound where one of the elements is a heavy isotope. For example, NaOH where the O is a heavier isotope. But O isotopes are more common in heavier elements, but oxygen isotopes are not that common, and heavy oxygen (O-18) is rare. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound where H is replaced by D, like D2O, but if X is NaOD, that's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound that contains a heavier isotope, like D in place of H. So if X is NaOD, perhaps, then in the reaction with a keto acid, you would get a product with different isotopes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think about the initial reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) violently, producing W gas (equal p and n), and precipitate G.

If X is D2O and Y is H2O2, then D2O + H2O2 → what? Maybe it's a decomposition reaction. H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2. But if X is D2O, perhaps it's a catalyst. Or maybe it's a different reaction. I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when a metal reacts with an acid, it produces hydrogen gas. So if W is H2, then H2 has 2 atoms. Each H has 1 p and 0 n, so total protons in H2 is 2, neutrons 0. That's not equal. So W can't be H2. So earlier thought about O2 was correct, because O2 has 16 p and 16 n per molecule. So W is O2.

So, reaction between X and Y produces O2 gas. So what reactions produce O2? One is the decomposition of H2O2 into H2O and O2. So Y could be H2O2, and X could be a catalyst, like manganese dioxide. But wait, MnO2 is a solid, not a liquid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else, like a metal that reacts with water to produce O2? But I don't recall metals reacting with water to produce O2. Maybe in the presence of an acid or another condition.

Wait, perhaps X is a peroxide, and Y is another peroxide. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a compound containing O and a strong base. For example, if Y is a carbonate and X is a strong base, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is between a chlorate and an acid, which can produce Cl2 gas, but that doesn't fit the W condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a nitrate and something else, but again, not sure.

Let me try to think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G forms. Then, upon heating G, B is released, which has a melting point near 277 K. If B is a solid that forms when G is heated, perhaps G is a carbonate, and heating it decomposes to produce CO2 (W?), and a metal oxide. Wait, but earlier W is O2, so that's conflicting. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. Heating sodium bicarbonate, for example, gives sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O. But in that case, W would be CO2, which has 22 p and 22 n per molecule, so that fits. So W is CO2, which would mean that the reaction between X and Y produces CO2 gas.

So, if Y is a carbonate solution and X is an acid, then the reaction would be acid + carbonate → CO2 + H2O and a salt. Then, the precipitate G could be the salt, perhaps, but if the acid is strong and the salt is soluble, it wouldn't precipitate. Hmm. Or perhaps Y is a bicarbonate.

Wait, let's outline possible reactions.

Suppose X is a strong acid, like H2SO4, and Y is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and sodium sulfate. But sodium sulfate is soluble, so it wouldn't form a precipitate. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate salt of a metal that forms an insoluble sulfate. For example, Y is CaCO3 (but that's a solid, not a liquid). Hmm, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, like Na2CO3. If X is H2SO4, then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O. Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so again, no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, what if X is a base and Y is an acid? For example, X is NaOH (liquid?), Y is H2SO4. Then, they neutralize to form Na2SO4, H2O. No gas produced. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me try to tie it all together.

If W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y produces O2. So possible reactions are decomposition of H2O2, which requires a catalyst. So X could be a catalyst, like MnO2, but MnO2 is a solid, and the question says X is a substance that has a heavier isotope, possibly in a compound.

Alternatively, X could be a peroxide, like Na2O2. But Na2O2 is a solid, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is H2O with some deuterium, like D2O (heavy water). So when D2O reacts with a liquid Y, maybe Y is H2O2. So D2O and H2O2 reacting. Let me think about that.

D2O and H2O2 reaction: I'm not very familiar with this, but perhaps it's a decomposition reaction. For example, H2O2 can decompose into H2O and O2. So if X is D2O, perhaps it's acting as a catalyst. But in that case, the reactants would be H2O2 and D2O, and the products are H2O (D if D2O is involved) and O2. So W would be O2, which fits the condition.

Then, the precipitate G could be something else. Wait, but in this case, what precipitates? If Y is H2O2 and X is D2O, perhaps the reaction is D2O + H2O2 → H2O + O2 + something else. But I'm not sure what would precipitate here.

Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid, like H2SO4. Then, D2O and H2SO4 might not react violently. So I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's say X is a base, like NaOH. Then, the reaction with a keto acid (like acetic acid, CH3COOH) would produce sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na^+). Sodium acetate has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. So that fits.

So if X is NaOH, then in the reaction with the keto acid, the product has two O's. That fits the condition.

So back to the initial reaction: X (NaOH) reacts with Y (liquid) violently to produce O2 gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B with a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, but NaOH is a solid, not a liquid. So if X is NaOH, it's a solid. But the problem says X is a substance, and Y is a liquid. Hmm, perhaps X is a solution of NaOH in water, but then it's not a pure substance. Alternatively, perhaps X is another compound.

Wait, but earlier I thought X has a heavy isotope, so perhaps it's D2O. So if X is D2O, which is a liquid, and Y is H2O2, which is also a liquid. Then, their reaction produces O2 gas. But what about the precipitate G? If D2O and H2O2 react, perhaps nothing precipitates, unless other substances are present.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a salt solution, and the reaction produces a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate, and X is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something else. Let me think: when X (D2O) reacts with Y (maybe H2O2), perhaps the reaction is D2O + H2O2 → H2O + O2 + D. Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate, and X is H2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas, and a precipitate of a metal sulfate. But if the metal sulfate is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, BaCO3 and H2SO4 would produce BaSO4 precipitate, CO2 gas, and H2O.

So in that case, X is H2SO4, Y is BaCO3 solution. Then, W is CO2, which fits the condition of equal p and n in the molecule. The precipitate G is BaSO4. When BaSO4 is heated, does it decompose? I think BaSO4 is stable upon heating, so maybe that's not it. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that when G is heated, B is released. So heating G causes B to form. If G is BaSO4, heating it doesn't release anything. So that's not fitting.

Another possibility: If G is a carbonate salt that decomposes upon heating. For example, NaHCO3. Heating NaHCO3 gives Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid with a melting point. Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate, and upon heating, it releases CO2 and forms a carbonate. But that doesn't directly give B as a solid with a melting point.

Wait, but earlier we thought B has a melting point near 277 K (about 4°C). That's just a bit above 0°C. So maybe B is a different form of water, like ice. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let's think of other compounds that melt around that temperature. For example, solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) melts at -78°C, which is way lower. Or maybe something else.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. For example, mercury is liquid at room temperature but solidifies below -40°C. Not matching. How about something like paraffin wax? It melts around 50-60°C, which is higher than 4°C. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different substance altogether. Let me think again about the precipitate G. Suppose G is a sulfate salt that, when heated, releases SO3 gas and forms something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck on the wrong path. Let me think about the possible elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

If X is D2O, the elements are D (deuterium, which is H-2) and O. So the lightest element is D (which is H), and the heaviest is O.

The atomic mass of D is approximately 2 g/mol, and O is 16 g/mol. So the sum is 2 + 16 = 18. But looking at the options, the choices are 25, 29, 31, 35. So 18 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe X is something else. Let's say X is H2O2. Then, X has H and O. If X has a heavier isotope, perhaps O-18. So the elements are H and O.

The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, which also isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X is something like CH3COOH (a keto acid), but that doesn't fit the earlier conditions.

Wait, another possibility: X is NaOH, which has Na, O, H. If one of these has a heavier isotope, perhaps O-18. So the elements are Na (atomic mass ~23), O (16), and H (1). So the lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 1+23=24, which is close to option B (25) but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is KOH, then K is about 39. So the lightest is H (1), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 40. Not matching any options except 35 or 31. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide). It has N, H, O. If one of these has a heavier isotope, like O-18. So elements are N (14), H (1), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Still not matching.

Wait, going back to the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid. The product has two O atoms. So the product could be something like a carboxylate salt, which has two O's in the anion.

So if X is a base like NaOH, then the product is a carboxylate, like CH3COO^- Na^+. So X is NaOH.

So X is NaOH, which has Na, O, H. Now, the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So Na, O, or H has a heavier isotope.

If it's H, then perhaps D is present. So in NaOH, the H could be deuterium. So X is NaOD. Now, the elements present are Na, O, D (which is H-2). So the lightest element is D (atomic mass 2), and the heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 2+23=25. That's option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the sum would be 18 if X is D2O. So maybe in this case, the sum is 25, which is option B.

So let me check the other conditions. X reacts with Y (liquid) violently to produce W gas (O2?), a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with melting point 277 K.

If X is NaOD (a base), and Y is H2SO4 (a liquid), then the reaction would be NaOD + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + D. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between NaOD and something else.

Wait, but if Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, then reacting with NaOD wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a chloride. Hmm, I'm not sure about the reaction conditions here.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is ethanol, and X is Na metal. But then, the reaction would produce H2 gas, which doesn't fit W's condition. Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is NaOD and Y is H2O2, then perhaps the reaction produces O2 gas. But I'm not certain about that.

But regardless, if the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is 25, that would correspond to option B.

So, putting it all together, the elements in X are Na (23), O (16), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Here's the analysis:

1. **Substance X**: The problem states that X reacts violently with liquid Y, releases gas W (where the molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons), and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, a solid with a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). Additionally, the product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

2. **Gas W**: The gas W must have equal numbers of protons and neutrons per molecule. A plausible candidate is O₂, as each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, making the molecule have 16 protons and 16 neutrons.

3. **Precipitate G and B**: When G is heated, it releases B, a solid with a melting point near 277 K. This suggests B could be a compound like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), which decomposes upon heating to produce CO₂ gas, Na₂CO₃, and H₂O. However, the exact identity of B is not critical to solving the problem.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X is likely a base, such as NaOH, which reacts with a keto acid to form a carboxylate salt (e.g., CH₃COO⁻Na⁺), where the carboxylate ion (CH₃COO⁻) contains 2 oxygen atoms.

5. **Heavier Isotope in X**: The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. If X is NaOH, the heavier isotope could be deuterium (D) replacing one of the hydrogen atoms, making X NaOD. This means X contains Na, O, and D.

6. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The lightest element in X is D (atomic mass ~2), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass ~23). The cumulative atomic masses of these elements sum to 2 + 23 = 25.

Thus, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are **25**.

Answer: B
