Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Spin isn't being considered here, so I can ignore that part. The state of the system is given as |1,1,2,-1>, where l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momenta of each electron, l is the total angular momentum, and m is the z-component of that total.

Wait, so each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. Because p orbitals have l=1. So each is in a p state. Now, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, but wait, I thought that when you couple two angular momenta, the maximum possible total l would be l1 + l2. So 1 + 1 is 2, which matches the l=2 here.

The problem asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Since L1z and L2z are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum, each can have eigenvalues -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1 implies m can be -1, 0, +1. But wait, in our notation, the eigenvalues are usually given as mħ, right? So for m=-1, the eigenvalue is -ħ. That makes sense.

So each L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. The question is, what's the probability that both are measured to be -ħ. So L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ.

But how do I find that? I think I need to look at the state |1,1,2,-1> and see what the possible combinations of m1 and m2 are that contribute to this state. Because each electron's m is the z-component of their orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the state is given in the coupled basis. So the state |l1, l2, L, M> is expressed as a combination of states where each electron's m is m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 = M. Which in this case, M is -1. Because the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the total L is 2, which is l1 + l2. So this is the maximum possible value for L. So the state |1,1,2, -1> is the state where the two angular momenta are aligned in such a way that their sum gives L=2, and the z-component is M=-1.

But how does that state decompose into the product states of individual m1 and m2? Because each electron's state would be |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, and when you combine them, you get a combination of all possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M.

So to find the probability, I need to find all possible pairs (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1, and then see if any of those pairs have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because that would be the case where both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

Wait, because each m is in units of ħ. So m1 is the eigenvalue divided by ħ. So m1 = -1 corresponds to L1z = -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the question is, does the state |1,1,2,-1> have any component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1?

Because if it does, then the probability is the square of the amplitude of that component. If not, then the probability is zero.

So let's think about the possible m1 and m2. Each can be -1, 0, +1.

We need m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0) → sum -1

(0, -1) → sum -1

(-1, 0) again? Wait, no, that's the same as the first. Or wait, no, m1 can be any of -1, 0, +1; same for m2.

Wait, let's list all possibilities where m1 + m2 = -1:

m1 = -1 → m2 must be 0 (since -1 +0= -1)

m1 = 0 → m2 must be -1

m1=1 → m2= -2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So this is not possible.

So the only two possible pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

Wait, that's two pairs. So when you write the state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a combination of the states |1,-1>⊗|1,0> and |1,0>⊗|1,-1> ?

Wait, I'm not sure. I think for two particles, the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is built from all possible |l1, m1>|l2, m2> where m1 + m2 = M.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of |1, m1>|1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

So the state should be a sum of these two basis states.

But wait, what's the coefficient for each term? For coupled angular momentum states, the coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But I'm not too familiar with all of them, so maybe I can reason it out.

In the case where L = l1 + l2, which is 2 here, the state |L=2, M=-1> should be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> because those are the only pairs that sum to M=-1.

So the state would be something like:

|1,1,2,-1> = a |1,-1>|1,0> + b |1,0>|1,-1>.

Because those are the only terms that contribute to M=-1.

What's the value of a and b?

I remember that when adding angular momenta, the state with maximum L is just the product of the highest m states. For |L=2, M=2>, it's |1,1>|1,1>, and similarly for other Ms. But for the lower Ms, it's a combination.

Wait, for L=2 and M=-2, the state would be |1,-1>|1,-1>, but for M=-1, it's a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1>.

Wait, but how do the coefficients look? I think for the highest L, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are such that each term is orthogonal. So for M = L, the state is just |l1, l2> = |l, m> product.

But when M is less than L, you get combinations.

In this case, since L=2 and M=-1, the state is a superposition of the two possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1.

Now, the question is whether the coefficients a and b are equal or not.

I think the state is symmetric under exchange of the two particles when the total L is even? Or wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, for L=2 and M=-1, it's a symmetric combination?

Wait, actually, when you have L=2 and M=-2, it's |1,-1>|1,-1>, which is symmetric. For M=0, I think it's a combination, but perhaps symmetric as well.

But in any case, for M=-1, the state is the symmetric combination of the two possible terms.

But wait, wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> is symmetric under exchange of the two particles because when you swap them, it just flips the terms but the state remains the same if the coefficients are the same.

Wait, because the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So when you swap the two electrons, |m1=-1, m2=0> becomes |m1=0, m2=-1>, which is the other term in the combination. So if the coefficients are the same, the state remains the same. So the state is symmetric under exchange.

Which would imply that the coefficients a and b are the same.

So the state is (|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) multiplied by some normalization factor.

What's the normalization factor?

The square of the coefficients should sum to 1.

So, for each term, the coefficient is a. Then, the square of each term is |a|^2, and since there are two terms, we have 2|a|^2 = 1. So a = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but I'm not sure because I might be missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the state is simply (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1>)/sqrt(2)}.

So, each term contributes equally.

In that case, the state |1,1,2,-1> is (|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1>)/sqrt(2).

So, when you measure L1z and L2z, each electron's m is determined.

So the possible outcomes are:

First term: m1=-1, m2=0 → L1z = -ħ, L2z = 0.

Second term: m1=0, m2=-1 → L1z = 0, L2z = -ħ.

Therefore, the state is an equal superposition (amplitude 1/sqrt(2) each) of these two possible states.

But the question asks for the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That would require m1=-1 and m2=-1.

Wait, but in the state, the only possibilities for m1 and m2 are either (-1,0) or (0,-1). There is no term where both are -1. Because m1 + m2 = -1, and the only way to get m1 = -1 is m2 = 0, and vice versa.

So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, there is no component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because that would give m1 + m2 = -2, but the state has M = -1.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.

To determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we analyze the given coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$, where $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy this condition are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

Thus, the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ can be written as:

\[
|1,1,2,-1> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> \right).
\]

This means the state is an equal superposition of two terms: one where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = 0$, and the other where $m_1 = 0$ and $m_2 = -1$. There is no component in this state where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, as this would require $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match $M = -1$.

Since the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ has no contribution from the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ configuration, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Spin isn't being considered here, so I can ignore that part. The state of the system is given as |1,1,2,-1>, where l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momenta of each electron, l is the total angular momentum, and m is the z-component of that total.

Wait, so each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. Because p orbitals have l=1. So each is in a p state. Now, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, but wait, I thought that when you couple two angular momenta, the maximum possible total l would be l1 + l2. So 1 + 1 is 2, which matches the l=2 here.

The problem asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Since L1z and L2z are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum, each can have eigenvalues -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1 implies m can be -1, 0, +1. But wait, in our notation, the eigenvalues are usually given as mħ, right? So for m=-1, the eigenvalue is -ħ. That makes sense.

So each L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. The question is, what's the probability that both are measured to be -ħ. So L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ.

But how do I find that? I think I need to look at the state |1,1,2,-1> and see what the possible combinations of m1 and m2 are that contribute to this state. Because each electron's m is the z-component of their orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the state is given in the coupled basis. So the state |l1, l2, L, M> is expressed as a combination of states where each electron's m is m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 = M. Which in this case, M is -1. Because the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the total L is 2, which is l1 + l2. So this is the maximum possible value for L. So the state |1,1,2, -1> is the state where the two angular momenta are aligned in such a way that their sum gives L=2, and the z-component is M=-1.

But how does that state decompose into the product states of individual m1 and m2? Because each electron's state would be |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, and when you combine them, you get a combination of all possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M.

So to find the probability, I need to find all possible pairs (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1, and then see if any of those pairs have m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because that would be the case where both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

Wait, because each m is in units of ħ. So m1 is the eigenvalue divided by ħ. So m1 = -1 corresponds to L1z = -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the question is, does the state |1,1,2,-1> have any component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1?

Because if it does, then the probability is the square of the amplitude of that component. If not, then the probability is zero.

So let's think about the possible m1 and m2. Each can be -1, 0, +1.

We need m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0) → sum -1

(0, -1) → sum -1

(-1, 0) again? Wait, no, that's the same as the first. Or wait, no, m1 can be any of -1, 0, +1; same for m2.

Wait, let's list all possibilities where m1 + m2 = -1:

m1 = -1 → m2 must be 0 (since -1 +0= -1)

m1 = 0 → m2 must be -1

m1=1 → m2= -2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So this is not possible.

So the only two possible pairs are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

Wait, that's two pairs. So when you write the state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a combination of the states |1,-1>⊗|1,0> and |1,0>⊗|1,-1> ?

Wait, I'm not sure. I think for two particles, the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is built from all possible |l1, m1>|l2, m2> where m1 + m2 = M.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a linear combination of |1, m1>|1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

So the state should be a sum of these two basis states.

But wait, what's the coefficient for each term? For coupled angular momentum states, the coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But I'm not too familiar with all of them, so maybe I can reason it out.

In the case where L = l1 + l2, which is 2 here, the state |L=2, M=-1> should be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> because those are the only pairs that sum to M=-1.

So the state would be something like:

|1,1,2,-1> = a |1,-1>|1,0> + b |1,0>|1,-1>.

Because those are the only terms that contribute to M=-1.

What's the value of a and b?

I remember that when adding angular momenta, the state with maximum L is just the product of the highest m states. For |L=2, M=2>, it's |1,1>|1,1>, and similarly for other Ms. But for the lower Ms, it's a combination.

Wait, for L=2 and M=-2, the state would be |1,-1>|1,-1>, but for M=-1, it's a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1>.

Wait, but how do the coefficients look? I think for the highest L, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are such that each term is orthogonal. So for M = L, the state is just |l1, l2> = |l, m> product.

But when M is less than L, you get combinations.

In this case, since L=2 and M=-1, the state is a superposition of the two possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1.

Now, the question is whether the coefficients a and b are equal or not.

I think the state is symmetric under exchange of the two particles when the total L is even? Or wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, for L=2 and M=-1, it's a symmetric combination?

Wait, actually, when you have L=2 and M=-2, it's |1,-1>|1,-1>, which is symmetric. For M=0, I think it's a combination, but perhaps symmetric as well.

But in any case, for M=-1, the state is the symmetric combination of the two possible terms.

But wait, wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> is symmetric under exchange of the two particles because when you swap them, it just flips the terms but the state remains the same if the coefficients are the same.

Wait, because the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So when you swap the two electrons, |m1=-1, m2=0> becomes |m1=0, m2=-1>, which is the other term in the combination. So if the coefficients are the same, the state remains the same. So the state is symmetric under exchange.

Which would imply that the coefficients a and b are the same.

So the state is (|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) multiplied by some normalization factor.

What's the normalization factor?

The square of the coefficients should sum to 1.

So, for each term, the coefficient is a. Then, the square of each term is |a|^2, and since there are two terms, we have 2|a|^2 = 1. So a = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, but I'm not sure because I might be missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the state is simply (|m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1>)/sqrt(2)}.

So, each term contributes equally.

In that case, the state |1,1,2,-1> is (|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1>)/sqrt(2).

So, when you measure L1z and L2z, each electron's m is determined.

So the possible outcomes are:

First term: m1=-1, m2=0 → L1z = -ħ, L2z = 0.

Second term: m1=0, m2=-1 → L1z = 0, L2z = -ħ.

Therefore, the state is an equal superposition (amplitude 1/sqrt(2) each) of these two possible states.

But the question asks for the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That would require m1=-1 and m2=-1.

Wait, but in the state, the only possibilities for m1 and m2 are either (-1,0) or (0,-1). There is no term where both are -1. Because m1 + m2 = -1, and the only way to get m1 = -1 is m2 = 0, and vice versa.

So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, there is no component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because that would give m1 + m2 = -2, but the state has M = -1.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.


To determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we analyze the given coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$, where $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy this condition are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

Thus, the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ can be written as:

\[
|1,1,2,-1> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> \right).
\]

This means the state is an equal superposition of two terms: one where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = 0$, and the other where $m_1 = 0$ and $m_2 = -1$. There is no component in this state where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, as this would require $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match $M = -1$.

Since the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ has no contribution from the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ configuration, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.
