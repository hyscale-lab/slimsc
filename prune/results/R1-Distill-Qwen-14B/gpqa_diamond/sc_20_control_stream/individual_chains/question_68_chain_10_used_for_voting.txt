Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic fields. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment after the magnetic field changes direction. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment mu is aligned with it. So, mu is along +Z. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S_z. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I remember that from my studies.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So, the particle's magnetic moment was initially along Z, and then the field switches to Y. I guess the moment itself doesn't change instantly, but the field does. Wait, no, the moment is a property of the particle, so when the field changes, the dynamics of the system will change.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. So, I need to find the frequency at which <S_z> oscillates.

Wait, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The original Hamiltonian was H_initial = - mu · B. Since B was along Z, H_initial was proportional to S_z. After the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian H_final would be proportional to S_y.

But wait, because the spin is 1/2, changing the direction of the magnetic field will change the energy eigenstates. So the system will now precess around the new field direction.

But how does this affect the expectation value of S_z? I think the spin will start precessing around the Y-axis, so its components in other directions, like Z, will oscillate over time.

In quantum mechanics, when a spin is subjected to a magnetic field in a particular direction, its precession frequency is related to the energy difference between its states, which depends on the magnetic field strength and the spin quantum number.

Wait, for a spin 1/2 particle, the energy levels are E = ±(gamma B / 2) * ħ, but wait, wait, let me get the units right. Actually, the energy is given by E = - mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, then E = -gamma S · B. So for a field along Z, E = -gamma B S_z. Since S_z can be ± ħ/2 for spin 1/2, the energies are ± gamma B ħ / 2.

But when the field is along Y, the energy becomes E = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 as well, the energy levels are ± gamma B ħ / 2. But wait, the eigenvalues of S_y are the same as S_z in magnitude. So the energy difference between the two states would be gamma B ħ.

Wait, no. The energy levels are E = (-gamma B) * (S_y). But for spin 1/2, S_y can be ± ħ/2. So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = + gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B ħ. Wait, but the actual splitting is 2 * (gamma B ħ/2) = gamma B ħ. Because the energy difference between the two states is the absolute difference: |E_+ - E_-| = gamma B ħ.

Wait, actually, E_+ = - (gamma B) (ħ/2), E_- = + (gamma B) (ħ/2). So the difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. So the energy difference is gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency omega is given by delta E divided by ħ. So omega = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait, that's the Larmor frequency when the field is along Y. But wait, I thought when the field is along a different axis, the frequency would change. But no, gamma is a property of the particle, and B is the same. So the frequency should be the same as when the field was along Z. But wait, in this case, the field was along Z initially, then turned off and Y is turned on. So the system's oscillation frequency is based on the new Hamiltonian, which is along Y.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the spin. So maybe I shouldn't directly think about energy transitions but about the expectation values.

In the initial state, the spin is aligned with the Z field. So the state is |+z>, which is spin-up in the Z direction.

When the field is suddenly switched to Y, the state of the spin doesn't change immediately. But the Hamiltonian now is proportional to S_y. So the state |+z> is not an eigenstate of S_y. Therefore, the system will evolve under the new Hamiltonian, causing the expectation value of S_z to oscillate over time.

What's the time evolution of the expectation value of S_z?

Let me model this. The Hamiltonian after the switch is H = - gamma B S_y. Wait, because mu = gamma S, and B is along Y. So H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y.

The time evolution of the state is given by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state is |ψ(0)> = |+z>.

We can write the time evolution operator as U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Then, |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>.

But to find <S_z>, I can compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Alternatively, think about the expectation value of S_z as a function of time. 

Another approach: the time evolution under H will cause the spin to precess around the Y-axis. So the expectation values of S_x, S_y, S_z will vary sinusoidally with some frequency.

The frequency of oscillation of S_z is determined by the energy splitting. Since the energy difference is gamma B ħ, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, when the field is along Y, the Larmor frequency is gamma B, same as when it's along Z. So the oscillation frequency of S_z should be gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma*B, but option D is gamma*B/sqrt(2). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some factors. Let me think again.

Wait, the oscillation frequency in expectation values could be twice the energy splitting over hbar, but no, the energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ, so delta E / ħ = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is omega = gamma B.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the matrix elements. Let me think about the state |+z> in terms of the new eigenbasis of H.

The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |−y>, with energies E_+ = gamma B ħ / 2 and E_- = - gamma B ħ / 2. Wait, wait, let me make sure. H is proportional to S_y. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y = (- gamma B) (ħ/2) |+y><+y| + (gamma B) (ħ/2) |−y><−y|.

Wait, no, wait: since H = - gamma B S_y, and S_y |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y>, so H |+y> = (- gamma B) (ħ/2) |+y>. Similarly, H |−y> = (- gamma B) (- ħ/2) |−y> = (gamma B ħ/2) |−y>.

So the energies are E_+ = (- gamma B) (ħ/2), and E_- = (gamma B) (ħ/2). So the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

So the angular frequency is omega = (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the energy levels split by gamma B ħ. The time evolution will cause transitions between these states, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Now, the initial state is |+z>. Let's express this state in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

The |+z> state can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |−y>.

I recall that |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). Let me verify this.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |−y>, where |+y> is (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) and |−y> is (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2).

But perhaps it's easier to write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

The states |+y> and |−y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |−z> as:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that's the other way around. Let me think. The rotation from z to y would involve a rotation about the x-axis by 90 degrees. So the transformation is:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2)

So, solving for |+z>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2)
|−z> = (|+y> - |−y>)/sqrt(2)

So yes, |+z> is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

So the initial state is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

Then, under the time evolution, each component will pick up a phase factor.

The time-dependent state is |ψ(t)> = [exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/ħ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+ = - (gamma B ħ) / 2, and E_- = (gamma B ħ)/2.

So, the state becomes [ exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2) t / ħ ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B ħ / 2) t / ħ ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Simplify the exponents: (gamma B /2) t and -(gamma B /2) t.

So, |ψ(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B t /2 )) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B t /2 )) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, let's compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>, S_z can be written as:

S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y>, because S_z swaps |+y> and |−y> with a phase.

Wait, let me think again. The action of S_z on |+y> and |−y>:

Since |+y> and |−y> are eigenstates of S_y, and S_z is another component, their matrix representation in the S_y basis might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> in the |+z> and |−z> basis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> using expectation values.

Since |+y> and |−y> are orthogonal, let's compute the terms.

The expectation value <S_z> = [ <y+| + <y−| ] (1/sqrt(2)) S_z (|y+> + |y−> ) / sqrt(2).

So, <S_z> = (1/2) [ <y+| S_z |y+> + <y+| S_z |y−> + <y−| S_z |y+> + <y−| S_z |y−> ]

Now, S_z |y+> = (ħ/2) |y−>, because S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y> ?

Wait, no. Let me think about commutators. S_y and S_z don't commute, so S_z acting on |+y> gives a combination of |+y> and |−y> ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to write S_z in the S_y basis. The S_z matrix in the S_y basis (states |+y>, |−y>) is:

S_z = (ħ/2) [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

Because S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y> and S_z |−y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

So, <y+| S_z |y+> = 0, because S_z |y+> = (ħ/2) |y−>, and <y+|y−> = 0.

Similarly, <y+| S_z |y−> = (ħ/2) <y+|y+> = ħ/2.

Same for <y−| S_z |y+> = ħ/2.

And <y−| S_z |y−> = 0.

So putting it together:

<S_z> = (1/2) [ 0 + (ħ/2) + (ħ/2) + 0 ] = (1/2)( ħ ) = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, which are symmetric around y, but S_z is along z, so their expectation value should oscillate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix representation. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: Let me compute the time evolution and find <S_z> as a function of time.

Express the state |ψ(t)> as:

( [e^{i (gamma B/2) t } |+y> + e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t } |−y> ] ) / sqrt(2).

The expectation value of S_z is <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

As S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y>, and S_z |−y> = (ħ/2) |+y>,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [ (e^{i (gamma B/2) t } )* <y+| + e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t }* <y−| ) / sqrt(2) ] * S_z [ (e^{i (gamma B/2) t } |y+> + e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t } |y−> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Multiplying everything out:

(1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } e^{i gamma B t/2 } <y+| S_z |y+> + e^{i gamma B t/2 } e^{-i gamma B t/2 } <y+| S_z |y−> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } e^{i gamma B t/2 } <y−| S_z |y+> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } e^{-i gamma B t/2 } <y−| S_z |y−> ]

Simplify the exponents:

First term exponent: 2i gamma B t/2 = i gamma B t.

But <y+| S_z |y+> is zero.

Second term exponent: 0. <y+| S_z |y−> is (ħ/2).

Third term exponent: 0. <y−| S_z |y+> is (ħ/2).

Fourth term exponent: -2i gamma B t/2 = -i gamma B t. <y−| S_z |y−> is zero.

So,

<S_z> = (1/2) [ 0 + (ħ/2) + (ħ/2) + 0 ] = (1/2)( ħ ) = ħ/2.

Wait, that's the same result as before. But that can't be right because it's a constant. But the question says the average oscillates.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in how I applied the time evolution. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the system is in a state that is a superposition of |+y> and |−y> and evolves with phases.

Wait, maybe I should proceed by expanding S_z in terms of the |+y> and |−y> basis. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time evolution in the |+z> and |−z> basis.

Wait, the initial state is |+z>, which can be written as:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)> = exp( -i H t / ħ ) |+z>.

H is -gamma B S_y, so H = -gamma B ( S_y ).

The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2, so H has eigenvalues E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So, the time evolution of |+z> is:

|ψ(t)> = exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) (|+y> component) + exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) (|−y> component) all divided by sqrt(2).

Which is what I did earlier.

So, |ψ(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to find <S_z>, let's compute the expectation value.

In the |+y> and |−y> basis, the matrix for S_z is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], as I thought earlier.

So, <S_z> = (1/2) [ (exp( i gamma B t/2 ) )*( exp( -i gamma B t/2 )) ) * (0) + ... ]

Wait, perhaps I should write <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> as (1/2) [ ( a* b ) + ... terms ].

Wait, maybe I should write this out more explicitly.

<ψ(t)| = (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| ]

S_z |ψ(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) S_z |y+> + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) S_z |y−> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ( ħ/2 |y−> ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ( ħ/2 |y+> ) ]

So, S_z |ψ(t)> is ( ħ/(2 sqrt(2)) ) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> ]

Now, compute the inner product <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| ] * ( ħ/(2 sqrt(2)) ) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> ]

Multiply the terms:

= (1/(2)) [ exp(i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp(i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| exp(i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> ) ] * ħ/2

Simplify each term:

First term: exp( i gamma B t/2 - i gamma B t/2 ) <y+|y−> = (1)(0) = 0.

Second term: exp( i gamma B t/2 + i gamma B t/2 ) <y+|y+> = exp( i gamma B t ) (1) = exp( i gamma B t )

Third term: exp( -i gamma B t/2 -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−|y−> = exp( -i gamma B t ) (1) = exp( -i gamma B t )

Fourth term: exp( -i gamma B t/2 + i gamma B t/2 ) <y−|y+> = 1 * 0 = 0.

So the four terms reduce to the second and third:

= (1/2) [ exp( i gamma B t ) + exp( -i gamma B t ) ] * ( ħ/2 )

The sum of the exponentials is 2 cos(gamma B t).

So,

= (1/2) * 2 cos(gamma B t) * ( ħ/2 )

= ( cos(gamma B t) ) * ( ħ/2 )

Wait, but the expectation value of S_z is in terms of ħ/2. Because S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the maximum value is ħ/2 and the minimum is -ħ/2. So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, the average mu_z is gamma * <S_z> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but let me think: The argument of the cosine is omega t, so omega is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. When the magnetic field was along Z, the resonance frequency is gamma B. But when the field is along Y, does the frequency change?

Hmm, the frequency depends on the energy difference between the spin states. Here, the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = gamma B ħ/2. The difference is gamma B ħ, so the frequency is gamma B.

So yes, the oscillation frequency should be gamma B.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when dealing with spin precession, the frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. But in some cases, for example, when considering spin in a rotating frame, the frequency might be different. But I think in this case, the frequency is just gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option B: gamma*B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment \( \mu = \gamma S_z \), initially aligned with a magnetic field along the \( +Z \)-direction. The field is then suddenly switched to point along the \( +Y \)-direction, with the same magnitude \( B \). The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average \( z \)-component of the particle’s moment, \( \langle S_z \rangle \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the magnetic field is along \( +Z \), and the particle’s moment \( \mu \) is aligned with it. The Hamiltonian is \( H_{\text{initial}} = -\mu \cdot B \), which is proportional to \( S_z \). When the field switches to \( +Y \), the new Hamiltonian becomes \( H_{\text{final}} = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y \).

2. **Time Evolution and Precession**:  
   After the field switches, the state of the particle remains \( |+z\rangle \), but this state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian \( H_{\text{final}} \). The particle’s spin will precess around the \( Y \)-axis, causing the expectation value \( \langle S_z \rangle \) to oscillate over time.

3. **Energy Splitting and Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The eigenstates of \( H_{\text{final}} \) are \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |−y\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar \gamma B}{2} \). The energy difference between these states is \( \Delta E = \hbar \gamma B \). The angular frequency of oscillation is determined by \( \omega = \Delta E / \hbar = \gamma B \).

4. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:  
   The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) can be expressed as a superposition of \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |−y\rangle \):  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |−y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   Under time evolution, the state evolves as:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t/2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t/2} |−y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   The expectation value of \( S_z \) is then computed as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]  
   This shows that \( \langle S_z \rangle \) oscillates sinusoidally with angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma B \).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The oscillation frequency of the \( z \)-component of the particle’s moment is determined by the energy splitting caused by the magnetic field along \( +Y \), which is \( \gamma B \). This matches option **B**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic fields. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment after the magnetic field changes direction. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment mu is aligned with it. So, mu is along +Z. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S_z. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I remember that from my studies.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So, the particle's magnetic moment was initially along Z, and then the field switches to Y. I guess the moment itself doesn't change instantly, but the field does. Wait, no, the moment is a property of the particle, so when the field changes, the dynamics of the system will change.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. So, I need to find the frequency at which <S_z> oscillates.

Wait, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The original Hamiltonian was H_initial = - mu · B. Since B was along Z, H_initial was proportional to S_z. After the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian H_final would be proportional to S_y.

But wait, because the spin is 1/2, changing the direction of the magnetic field will change the energy eigenstates. So the system will now precess around the new field direction.

But how does this affect the expectation value of S_z? I think the spin will start precessing around the Y-axis, so its components in other directions, like Z, will oscillate over time.

In quantum mechanics, when a spin is subjected to a magnetic field in a particular direction, its precession frequency is related to the energy difference between its states, which depends on the magnetic field strength and the spin quantum number.

Wait, for a spin 1/2 particle, the energy levels are E = ±(gamma B / 2) * ħ, but wait, wait, let me get the units right. Actually, the energy is given by E = - mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, then E = -gamma S · B. So for a field along Z, E = -gamma B S_z. Since S_z can be ± ħ/2 for spin 1/2, the energies are ± gamma B ħ / 2.

But when the field is along Y, the energy becomes E = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 as well, the energy levels are ± gamma B ħ / 2. But wait, the eigenvalues of S_y are the same as S_z in magnitude. So the energy difference between the two states would be gamma B ħ.

Wait, no. The energy levels are E = (-gamma B) * (S_y). But for spin 1/2, S_y can be ± ħ/2. So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = + gamma B (ħ/2). So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = -gamma B ħ. Wait, but the actual splitting is 2 * (gamma B ħ/2) = gamma B ħ. Because the energy difference between the two states is the absolute difference: |E_+ - E_-| = gamma B ħ.

Wait, actually, E_+ = - (gamma B) (ħ/2), E_- = + (gamma B) (ħ/2). So the difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. So the energy difference is gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency omega is given by delta E divided by ħ. So omega = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. But wait, that's the Larmor frequency when the field is along Y. But wait, I thought when the field is along a different axis, the frequency would change. But no, gamma is a property of the particle, and B is the same. So the frequency should be the same as when the field was along Z. But wait, in this case, the field was along Z initially, then turned off and Y is turned on. So the system's oscillation frequency is based on the new Hamiltonian, which is along Y.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the spin. So maybe I shouldn't directly think about energy transitions but about the expectation values.

In the initial state, the spin is aligned with the Z field. So the state is |+z>, which is spin-up in the Z direction.

When the field is suddenly switched to Y, the state of the spin doesn't change immediately. But the Hamiltonian now is proportional to S_y. So the state |+z> is not an eigenstate of S_y. Therefore, the system will evolve under the new Hamiltonian, causing the expectation value of S_z to oscillate over time.

What's the time evolution of the expectation value of S_z?

Let me model this. The Hamiltonian after the switch is H = - gamma B S_y. Wait, because mu = gamma S, and B is along Y. So H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y.

The time evolution of the state is given by the Schrödinger equation. The initial state is |ψ(0)> = |+z>.

We can write the time evolution operator as U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). Then, |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>.

But to find <S_z>, I can compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Alternatively, think about the expectation value of S_z as a function of time. 

Another approach: the time evolution under H will cause the spin to precess around the Y-axis. So the expectation values of S_x, S_y, S_z will vary sinusoidally with some frequency.

The frequency of oscillation of S_z is determined by the energy splitting. Since the energy difference is gamma B ħ, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, when the field is along Y, the Larmor frequency is gamma B, same as when it's along Z. So the oscillation frequency of S_z should be gamma B.

But looking at the options, option B is gamma*B, but option D is gamma*B/sqrt(2). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some factors. Let me think again.

Wait, the oscillation frequency in expectation values could be twice the energy splitting over hbar, but no, the energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ, so delta E / ħ = gamma B. So the angular frequency is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value is omega = gamma B.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the matrix elements. Let me think about the state |+z> in terms of the new eigenbasis of H.

The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |−y>, with energies E_+ = gamma B ħ / 2 and E_- = - gamma B ħ / 2. Wait, wait, let me make sure. H is proportional to S_y. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y = (- gamma B) (ħ/2) |+y><+y| + (gamma B) (ħ/2) |−y><−y|.

Wait, no, wait: since H = - gamma B S_y, and S_y |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y>, so H |+y> = (- gamma B) (ħ/2) |+y>. Similarly, H |−y> = (- gamma B) (- ħ/2) |−y> = (gamma B ħ/2) |−y>.

So the energies are E_+ = (- gamma B) (ħ/2), and E_- = (gamma B) (ħ/2). So the energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

So the angular frequency is omega = (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the energy levels split by gamma B ħ. The time evolution will cause transitions between these states, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Now, the initial state is |+z>. Let's express this state in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

The |+z> state can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |−y>.

I recall that |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2). Let me verify this.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |−y>, where |+y> is (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) and |−y> is (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2).

But perhaps it's easier to write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>.

The states |+y> and |−y> can be written in terms of |+z> and |−z> as:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that's the other way around. Let me think. The rotation from z to y would involve a rotation about the x-axis by 90 degrees. So the transformation is:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/sqrt(2)

So, solving for |+z>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2)
|−z> = (|+y> - |−y>)/sqrt(2)

So yes, |+z> is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

So the initial state is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2).

Then, under the time evolution, each component will pick up a phase factor.

The time-dependent state is |ψ(t)> = [exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t/ħ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+ = - (gamma B ħ) / 2, and E_- = (gamma B ħ)/2.

So, the state becomes [ exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2) t / ħ ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B ħ / 2) t / ħ ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Simplify the exponents: (gamma B /2) t and -(gamma B /2) t.

So, |ψ(t)> = [ exp(i (gamma B t /2 )) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B t /2 )) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, let's compute the expectation value of S_z, which is <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>, S_z can be written as:

S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y>, because S_z swaps |+y> and |−y> with a phase.

Wait, let me think again. The action of S_z on |+y> and |−y>:

Since |+y> and |−y> are eigenstates of S_y, and S_z is another component, their matrix representation in the S_y basis might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> in the |+z> and |−z> basis, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> using expectation values.

Since |+y> and |−y> are orthogonal, let's compute the terms.

The expectation value <S_z> = [ <y+| + <y−| ] (1/sqrt(2)) S_z (|y+> + |y−> ) / sqrt(2).

So, <S_z> = (1/2) [ <y+| S_z |y+> + <y+| S_z |y−> + <y−| S_z |y+> + <y−| S_z |y−> ]

Now, S_z |y+> = (ħ/2) |y−>, because S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y> ?

Wait, no. Let me think about commutators. S_y and S_z don't commute, so S_z acting on |+y> gives a combination of |+y> and |−y> ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to write S_z in the S_y basis. The S_z matrix in the S_y basis (states |+y>, |−y>) is:

S_z = (ħ/2) [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

Because S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y> and S_z |−y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

So, <y+| S_z |y+> = 0, because S_z |y+> = (ħ/2) |y−>, and <y+|y−> = 0.

Similarly, <y+| S_z |y−> = (ħ/2) <y+|y+> = ħ/2.

Same for <y−| S_z |y+> = ħ/2.

And <y−| S_z |y−> = 0.

So putting it together:

<S_z> = (1/2) [ 0 + (ħ/2) + (ħ/2) + 0 ] = (1/2)( ħ ) = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the state is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, which are symmetric around y, but S_z is along z, so their expectation value should oscillate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix representation. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: Let me compute the time evolution and find <S_z> as a function of time.

Express the state |ψ(t)> as:

( [e^{i (gamma B/2) t } |+y> + e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t } |−y> ] ) / sqrt(2).

The expectation value of S_z is <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

As S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) |−y>, and S_z |−y> = (ħ/2) |+y>,

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> = [ (e^{i (gamma B/2) t } )* <y+| + e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t }* <y−| ) / sqrt(2) ] * S_z [ (e^{i (gamma B/2) t } |y+> + e^{ -i (gamma B/2) t } |y−> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Multiplying everything out:

(1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } e^{i gamma B t/2 } <y+| S_z |y+> + e^{i gamma B t/2 } e^{-i gamma B t/2 } <y+| S_z |y−> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } e^{i gamma B t/2 } <y−| S_z |y+> + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } e^{-i gamma B t/2 } <y−| S_z |y−> ]

Simplify the exponents:

First term exponent: 2i gamma B t/2 = i gamma B t.

But <y+| S_z |y+> is zero.

Second term exponent: 0. <y+| S_z |y−> is (ħ/2).

Third term exponent: 0. <y−| S_z |y+> is (ħ/2).

Fourth term exponent: -2i gamma B t/2 = -i gamma B t. <y−| S_z |y−> is zero.

So,

<S_z> = (1/2) [ 0 + (ħ/2) + (ħ/2) + 0 ] = (1/2)( ħ ) = ħ/2.

Wait, that's the same result as before. But that can't be right because it's a constant. But the question says the average oscillates.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in how I applied the time evolution. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the system is in a state that is a superposition of |+y> and |−y> and evolves with phases.

Wait, maybe I should proceed by expanding S_z in terms of the |+y> and |−y> basis. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time evolution in the |+z> and |−z> basis.

Wait, the initial state is |+z>, which can be written as:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)> = exp( -i H t / ħ ) |+z>.

H is -gamma B S_y, so H = -gamma B ( S_y ).

The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2, so H has eigenvalues E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So, the time evolution of |+z> is:

|ψ(t)> = exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) (|+y> component) + exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) (|−y> component) all divided by sqrt(2).

Which is what I did earlier.

So, |ψ(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to find <S_z>, let's compute the expectation value.

In the |+y> and |−y> basis, the matrix for S_z is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], as I thought earlier.

So, <S_z> = (1/2) [ (exp( i gamma B t/2 ) )*( exp( -i gamma B t/2 )) ) * (0) + ... ]

Wait, perhaps I should write <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)> as (1/2) [ ( a* b ) + ... terms ].

Wait, maybe I should write this out more explicitly.

<ψ(t)| = (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| ]

S_z |ψ(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) S_z |y+> + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) S_z |y−> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) ( ħ/2 |y−> ) + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) ( ħ/2 |y+> ) ]

So, S_z |ψ(t)> is ( ħ/(2 sqrt(2)) ) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> ]

Now, compute the inner product <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| ] * ( ħ/(2 sqrt(2)) ) [ exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> ]

Multiply the terms:

= (1/(2)) [ exp(i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp(i gamma B t/2 ) <y+| exp(i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) |y−> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−| exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |y+> ) ] * ħ/2

Simplify each term:

First term: exp( i gamma B t/2 - i gamma B t/2 ) <y+|y−> = (1)(0) = 0.

Second term: exp( i gamma B t/2 + i gamma B t/2 ) <y+|y+> = exp( i gamma B t ) (1) = exp( i gamma B t )

Third term: exp( -i gamma B t/2 -i gamma B t/2 ) <y−|y−> = exp( -i gamma B t ) (1) = exp( -i gamma B t )

Fourth term: exp( -i gamma B t/2 + i gamma B t/2 ) <y−|y+> = 1 * 0 = 0.

So the four terms reduce to the second and third:

= (1/2) [ exp( i gamma B t ) + exp( -i gamma B t ) ] * ( ħ/2 )

The sum of the exponentials is 2 cos(gamma B t).

So,

= (1/2) * 2 cos(gamma B t) * ( ħ/2 )

= ( cos(gamma B t) ) * ( ħ/2 )

Wait, but the expectation value of S_z is in terms of ħ/2. Because S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the maximum value is ħ/2 and the minimum is -ħ/2. So <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, the average mu_z is gamma * <S_z> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but let me think: The argument of the cosine is omega t, so omega is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. When the magnetic field was along Z, the resonance frequency is gamma B. But when the field is along Y, does the frequency change?

Hmm, the frequency depends on the energy difference between the spin states. Here, the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = gamma B ħ/2. The difference is gamma B ħ, so the frequency is gamma B.

So yes, the oscillation frequency should be gamma B.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when dealing with spin precession, the frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. But in some cases, for example, when considering spin in a rotating frame, the frequency might be different. But I think in this case, the frequency is just gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option B: gamma*B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment \( \mu = \gamma S_z \), initially aligned with a magnetic field along the \( +Z \)-direction. The field is then suddenly switched to point along the \( +Y \)-direction, with the same magnitude \( B \). The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average \( z \)-component of the particle’s moment, \( \langle S_z \rangle \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the magnetic field is along \( +Z \), and the particle’s moment \( \mu \) is aligned with it. The Hamiltonian is \( H_{\text{initial}} = -\mu \cdot B \), which is proportional to \( S_z \). When the field switches to \( +Y \), the new Hamiltonian becomes \( H_{\text{final}} = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y \).

2. **Time Evolution and Precession**:  
   After the field switches, the state of the particle remains \( |+z\rangle \), but this state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian \( H_{\text{final}} \). The particle’s spin will precess around the \( Y \)-axis, causing the expectation value \( \langle S_z \rangle \) to oscillate over time.

3. **Energy Splitting and Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The eigenstates of \( H_{\text{final}} \) are \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |−y\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar \gamma B}{2} \). The energy difference between these states is \( \Delta E = \hbar \gamma B \). The angular frequency of oscillation is determined by \( \omega = \Delta E / \hbar = \gamma B \).

4. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:  
   The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) can be expressed as a superposition of \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |−y\rangle \):  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |−y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   Under time evolution, the state evolves as:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t/2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t/2} |−y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   The expectation value of \( S_z \) is then computed as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]  
   This shows that \( \langle S_z \rangle \) oscillates sinusoidally with angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma B \).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The oscillation frequency of the \( z \)-component of the particle’s moment is determined by the energy splitting caused by the magnetic field along \( +Y \), which is \( \gamma B \). This matches option **B**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
