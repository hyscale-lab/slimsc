Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture shaped like a polygon. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The aperture is a N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. We're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and the angles are small, so we can approximate tan(theta) as theta.

Wait, so when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So the problem is essentially about a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) with several dark rings around it. The positions of these dark rings (minima) are important here.

The formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by something like a sin(theta) = m * λ, where m is an integer, but wait, no, that's for single-slit diffraction. Oh wait, no, for single-slit it's a sin(theta)= mλ, but for circular apertures (like in a camera lens or a telescope), the dark rings are given by different conditions. I think for the minima in a circular aperture, the condition is based on the Bessel function zeros. The first dark ring occurs when the argument of the Bessel function J1 is equal to its first zero.

Right, the condition is that the Bessel function J1(k r) has its first zero. The first minimum (the first dark ring) happens at the first zero of J1, which is approximately at k r = 3.8317, but wait no, wait. Wait, the minima in the circular aperture occur where the derivative of the Bessel function equals zero, right? Oh wait, no, I think the zeros of J_m are where the intensity nodes are. For the first dark ring, it's the first zero of J_1, which is approximately 3.8317. But wait, that's for the first minimum beyond the central maximum.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is called the Airy pattern. The central maximum is surrounded by dark rings. The first dark ring occurs when the argument of J_1 is equal to its first zero. The first zero of J_1 is at around 3.8317, but wait, no, the first zero of J_1 is 3.8317? Or is it J_1's first minimum?

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for the minima in circular apertures. The condition for the m-th minimum is that the argument is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J_1. So for the first minimum, m=1, so the argument is x = 3.8317. But wait, wait. Let me get the exact formula.

The condition for the m-th dark ring is given by: (π a sinθ)/λ = x_{m}, where x_{m} is the m-th zero of the derivative of the Bessel function J_1. Alternatively, another source says that the dark rings occur when the phase change is (m + 1/2)π for some condition. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between different types of diffraction.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a circular aperture, the intensity pattern is given by the square of the Bessel function J_1. The positions of the minima are where J_1 reaches zero. The first zero of J_1 is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the condition for the first minimum is J_1(x) = 0, so x = 3.8317.

Wait, but another thought. Alternatively, maybe the formula I should be using is a sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer, but that's for a single slit. So for single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = m λ. But for a circular aperture, it's different. So for the circular case, the first minimum is at a sinθ ≈ 3.8317 λ/(2a), but wait, no, wait.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The intensity in the far field for a circular aperture is I(θ) proportional to (J_1(k a sinθ)/ (k a sinθ))^2, where k is 2π/λ. So the intensity is maximum when J_1 is maximum, which is around sinθ ~ 1.22 λ/(π a) for the first minimum. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the condition for minima occurs when the argument of the Bessel function J_1 is equal to its zeros. The first zero of J_1 is at x = 3.8317. So the condition is (k a sinθ) = x, so k a sinθ = 3.8317, where k = 2π/λ.

So solving for sinθ: sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). Since the angles are small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I've also heard that the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/(a), which is approximately 1.22 times the wavelength over the aperture radius.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: The first minimum in the Airy pattern occurs at θ where a sinθ = 1.22 λ, right? Because a is the radius. Wait, wait. Wait, the formula is a sinθ = 1.22 λ. So θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a, but that's when a is the radius. But wait, in our problem, 'a' is the apothem.

Ah! Wait, so in the problem, 'a' is the apothem of the polygon. But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a regular polygon with a very large N, approaching a circle. But what is the apothem in the case of a circle? The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius. Wait, but wait: For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. As N approaches infinity, the regular polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' becomes equal to the radius of the circle. So in the limit as N becomes infinitely large, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.

So in that case, the formula for the first minimum in the Airy diffraction pattern is a sinθ = 1.22 λ. Since the problem states that angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (1.22 λ)/a. But wait, that's the angular position of the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the first minimum is the first dark spot beyond the central maximum. The next minima would be the next zeros. So the first minimum is at m=1, second at m=2, etc. So in terms of the formula, for the m-th minimum, a sinθ = x_m * λ/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J_1. Wait no, perhaps I should rederive it.

The intensity distribution for a circular aperture is given by:

I(θ) ∝ [J_1(k a sinθ) / (k a sinθ)]^2,

where k = 2π/λ.

The minima occur where J_1(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J_1 are at x = 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc.

So the first minimum is at k a sinθ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a).

But wait, no: Wait, J_1(x) has its first zero at x ≈ 3.8317. So when k a sinθ = 3.8317, that's the first minimum. So θ₁ ≈ sin⁻¹(3.8317 λ/(2π a)).

Similarly, the next minimum is when x=7.0156, so θ₂ ≈ sin⁻¹(7.0156 λ/(2π a)).

The angular distance between the first two minima would be θ₂ - θ₁.

But since the angles are small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (x λ)/(2π a).

So θ₂ - θ₁ = [7.0156 λ/(2π a)] - [3.8317 λ/(2π a)] = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) λ/(2π a).

Wait, 3.1839 divided by 2π is approximately 3.1839/(6.2832) ≈ 0.506.

So angular distance is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

The zeros of J_1: first is 3.8317, second is 7.0156. The difference between the first two zeros is approximately 7.0156 -3.8317 ≈ 3.1839.

So the difference in x is 3.1839. Then, (x2 - x1) * λ/(2π a) = (3.1839 * λ)/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839)/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

So that's option D.

Wait, but another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the minima is a sinθ = (m + 0.5) π λ/(something). Wait, but that might not be right.

Wait, another way: For the first minimum, the condition is a sinθ = 1.22 λ, as I thought earlier. So θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/(a). The second minimum would be at a higher angle. Wait, but wait, no, because the zeros are at 3.8317, 7.0156 etc., so the next minima are further apart in terms of the x variable, but perhaps not in θ.

Wait, but more accurately, the first minima in the Airy pattern occurs at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/a. The next minima are at θ2 ≈ (2.23 λ)/a, but wait, that's not matching with the previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the zeros of J_1 and the minima in the Airy pattern.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The formula I should use is that the minima occur when (π a sinθ)/λ = x, where x is the m-th zero of J_1 (since the intensity is proportional to |J_1(π a sinθ/λ)|²). So the first minima occurs at x=3.8317, second at x=7.0156, etc. So for the first minima, (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a).

So θ1 ≈ 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.220 λ/a. So θ1 is about 1.22 λ/a.

Similarly, the second minima occurs at x=7.0156, so sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(3.1416) λ/a ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

Wait, but wait, 7.0156 / 3.1416 is approximately 2.234. So that would be θ2 ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

So the angular distance between the first two minima is θ2 - θ1 = (2.234 - 1.220) λ/a ≈ 1.014 λ/a. But that's not matching any of the options. Wait, but none of the options have 1.014. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The correct condition is that the argument of the Bessel function is x = π a sinθ / λ. So for the first minima, x=3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a). So θ1 is about 3.8317/(π a λ) → wait, no, sinθ is (3.8317 λ)/(π a), so θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a) → 3.8317 / 3.1416 ≈ 1.22, so θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Similarly, the second minima is at x=7.0156, so sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) → θ2 ≈ 7.0156/(3.1416) ≈ 2.234 λ/a. So the difference is about (2.234 - 1.22) ≈ 1.014, which would be about 1.014 λ/a. But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are 0.61, 0.5, 1.22, 0.506. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the first two minima are at x=3.8317 and x=7.0156. Because perhaps the first minima after the central maximum is at x=3.8317, but maybe the 'first minima' refers to the first dark spot on either side, so perhaps the minima in the pattern are symmetric around θ=0. So perhaps the first minima on either side are at ±θ1, and the next minima are at ±θ2.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which I think refers to the angle between the two adjacent minima on one side of the central maximum. Wait, no, perhaps it's the angle between the first and second minima on the same side. So θ2 - θ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the position of the first minima, which is at 1.22 λ/a, and the second minima at 2.44 λ/a, making the angular distance between them 1.22 λ/a, but that doesn't match any of the options except option C, which is 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me check a reference. So according to the Airy diffraction pattern, the first dark ring occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/a, and the next at θ = 2.23 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima is 2.23 -1.22 ≈ 1.01 λ/a, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem statement again. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinite. So perhaps the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a is the radius of the circle. So when N is very large, the apothem a is the radius.

But I'm getting confused because in the problem statement, the apothems of the polygon are all of length a. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' is the same as the radius of the circle. So the question is considering a circular aperture with radius a.

In that case, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is at θ = 1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ ≈ 2.23 λ/a, as I thought earlier. So the angular distance between them is approximately 1.01 λ/a, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the angular distance between the first and second minima, but rather the angular distance between the first minimum and the next minimum on the same side, i.e., the first and second minima on one side of the central maximum.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. Option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is the position of the first minimum. So that can't be the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture, but using a different approach to find the minima.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not using the Bessel function approach but instead using the single-slit formula. Because for a single slit of width a, the minima occur at a sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer. The first minimum is at θ = λ/(a), the second at 2λ/(a), so the distance between first and second minima is (2λ/a - λ/a) = λ/a. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, but wait, the options don't include λ/a, but option B is 0.5, which is λ/(2a). Hmm, perhaps the polygon is not a circle, but when N is infinite, perhaps it's treated differently.

Wait, but the problem states that all apothems are the same length a, which for a polygon with a large N, is the radius of the circle. So perhaps the problem is analogous to a single slit with width 2a, leading to minima at a sinθ = m λ/2. Because for a single slit of width 'd', the minima are at d sinθ = m λ. But if the slit were of width 2a, then minima would be at 2a sinθ = m λ → a sinθ = (m λ)/2. So for m=1, a sinθ = λ/2 → θ ≈ λ/(2a). For m=2, a sinθ = λ → θ ≈ λ/a. The distance between them would be λ/(2a).

But that would give an angular distance of (λ/a - λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a. Which is option B.

Hmm, but this approach would imply that the polygon is being treated as a single slit with width 2a, which doesn't make sense because a polygon with a finite number of sides would have a more complex diffraction pattern, but for N approaching infinity, perhaps the pattern approximates that of a single slit.

Wait, but no, a circular aperture's diffraction pattern is different from a single slit. So perhaps this line of thinking is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that when the polygon becomes a circle (N→infinite), what is the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the circular case, which leads to the first minima at 1.22 λ/a, and the second at approximately 2.23 λ/a, leading to a difference of about 1.01 λ/a, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to think of the circular aperture and the first minima angular positions, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is referring to the minima in the diffraction pattern as the first and second zeros of the Bessel function, but considering the first two minima after the central maximum. So the first minima is m=1, the second is m=2. So the positions are at θ1= (3.8317 λ)/(π a) and θ2= (7.0156 λ)/(π a). So the difference is (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(π a) ≈ 3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈ 3.1839/(3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a.

But again, none of the options match 1.013. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case correctly. Let me think again: the polygon's apothem is 'a', which for a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the regular polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'. So the radius R = a. So in the case of a circular aperture with radius R = a, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(R) → 1.22 λ/a.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first two minima on one side of the central maximum are the first and second minima on that side. So the first minima at θ1 = 1.22 λ/a, and the second at θ2 = 2.44 λ/a. So the angular distance would be 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, that would make the angular distance between them 1.22 λ/a, which is option C. But earlier I thought the second minima was at around 2.23 λ/a. So perhaps this is where I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to look up the exact positions of the minima in the Airy pattern. The positions of the dark rings in the Airy pattern correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J_1. The first zero is at x≈3.8317, the second at x≈7.0156, the third at x≈10.1735, etc.

So the angular positions are θ_m = (x_m λ) / (π a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J_1.

So θ1 = 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.220 λ/a.

θ2 =7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ (7.0156/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

So the distance between θ2 and θ1 is 2.234 -1.220=1.014 λ/a. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, but wait the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering the distance between the first minima on either side, but that wouldn't make sense because they are symmetric around zero. So perhaps the question is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima on one side.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a square or another shape, but when N is infinite, it's a circle.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the polygon is being considered as a collection of rectangular slits, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: considering the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture, the minima are at θ_m = x_m λ/(π a), where x_m is the zero of J_1.

So the first minimum is at x1=3.8317 → θ1=3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

The second minimum is at x2=7.0156 → θ2=7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

The angular distance between them is θ2-θ1 ≈ (2.234 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.014 λ/a, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 7.0156 -3.8317. Let me do that precisely.

7.0156 -3.8317 = (7 -3) + (0.0156 -0.8317) → 3 - 0.8161 = 2.1839? No, wait that's not correct. Wait, 7.0156 -3.8317 = 3.1839. So 3.1839/(π) ≈ 1.013, as before.

Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. That's about half of 1.013. So maybe I'm missing a factor of two somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, the condition is (π a sinθ)/λ = x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of J_1. So solving for sinθ, sinθ = x_m λ/(π a).

But, perhaps the correct formula is (π a sinθ)/λ = x_m, so for the first minimum, x_1=3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a).

And for the second minimum, x_2=7.0156 → sinθ = (7.0156 λ)/(π a).

So the angular positions are θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.220 λ/a.

θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ (7.0156/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

The difference is about 2.234 -1.220 = 1.014 λ/a, which is approximately 1.014 λ/a. But none of the options match this.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first and second minima on either side of the central maximum, but that would not make sense because the first minima on either side are at the same angle as θ and -θ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture. For example, if the polygon is a square, perhaps the diffraction pattern is more complicated, but when N is large, it's treated as a circle.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture with some dimensions, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a many-sided polygon, but in the limit of N approaching infinity, it becomes a circle, but the calculation is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not using the first and second minima beyond the central maximum, but perhaps the first minima in the diffraction pattern is considered as the central dark spot, but that doesn't make sense because the central spot is the brightest.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem again. The polygon has N sides, but when N is infinite, it's a circle. The apothem is 'a', which as the radius of the circle.

In the Fraunhofer diffraction of a circular aperture, the angular positions of the minima are given by a sinθ = x_m λ/(π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J_1.

So for m=1, a sinθ = 3.8317 λ/(π) → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) → θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a) = (3.8317/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.220 λ/a.

Similarly, for m=2, a sinθ =7.0156 λ/(π) → sinθ ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(π a) → θ ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

The angular separation between these two minima would be (2.234 -1.220) λ/a ≈ 1.014 λ/a. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps the correct approach is to find the first two minima on the same side of the central maximum, which would be m=1 and m=2, and the distance between them would be (2.234 -1.220) λ/a ≈ 1.014 λ/a, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first minimum on each side (so two minima at ±1.22 λ/a), but the angular distance between them would be 2*(1.22 λ/a), which is 2.44 λ/a, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a

D) 0.506 λ/a

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the condition for the first minimum as a sinθ = λ, which would give θ= λ/a, and the second minimum at a sinθ=2λ, giving θ=2 λ/a. The angular distance between them would be λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the polygon as a collection of point sources, leading to a diffraction pattern based on the number of sides.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the problem says the polygon has all apothems of length a. For a regular N-gon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem a.

In that case, the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

As I've calculated earlier, the positions of the minima are at θ_m = x_m λ/(π a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J_1.

So the first two minima are at x=3.8317 and x=7.0156.

So θ1 = 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.220 λ/a,

θ2 =7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

The difference is θ2 - θ1 ≈ 1.014 λ/a.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. That's approximately half of 1.014. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the first minimum is at m=1 and the second at m=2, but the angular distance is (x2 - x1) λ/(π a) = (7.0156 -3.8317) λ/(π a) = 3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈ 3.1839/(3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a.

Hmm, but that's not an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the condition for the minima is (a sinθ) = (x_m) λ/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J_1.

So for m=1, a sinθ =3.8317 λ/(2π) → θ1 =3.8317 λ/(2π a).

Similarly, for m=2, a sinθ=7.0156 λ/(2π) → θ2=7.0156 λ/(2π a).

The difference is (7.0156 -3.8317) λ/(2π a) =3.1839 λ/(2π a).

3.1839/(2*3.1416) = 3.1839/(6.2832) ≈ 0.506.

So the angular distance would be 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Ah! So perhaps I was using the wrong formula earlier. The condition for the minima should be (a sinθ) = x_m λ/(2π), not π a sinθ =x_m λ.

Wait, let me re-derive the condition correctly.

The intensity pattern for a circular aperture is given by I(θ) proportional to [J_1(k a sinθ) / (k a sinθ)]^2,

where k=2π/λ.

The minima occur where J_1(k a sinθ) =0.

The zeros of J_1 are at x_m =3.8317, 7.0156, etc.

So, k a sinθ = x_m → a sinθ = x_m λ/(2π).

So, sinθ = x_m λ/(2π a).

So, θ_m = x_m λ/(2π a).

So for m=1, θ1 =3.8317 λ/(2π a) → approximately (3.8317)/(6.2832) → 0.610 λ/a.

For m=2, θ2 =7.0156 λ/(2π a) → 7.0156/(6.2832) ≈1.116 λ/a.

The angular distance between the first and second minima is (1.116 -0.610) λ/a ≈0.506 λ/a, which matches option D.

Ah! So I think I see where I went wrong earlier. The correct condition is a sinθ = x_m λ/(2π), not π a sinθ =x_m λ. I had the wrong denominator earlier. So the correct calculation is (x2 -x1) * λ/(2π a) = (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ/(2π a) =3.1839 λ/(2π a) ≈0.506 λ/a.

So the correct answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a.

To solve the problem, we analyze the diffraction pattern created by a monochromatic light beam passing through an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. When \( N \to \infty \), the polygon becomes a circle, and the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Diffraction Pattern of a Circular Aperture**:  
   The intensity distribution for a circular aperture is given by:
   \[
   I(\theta) \propto \left(\frac{J_1(k a \sin\theta)}{k a \sin\theta}\right)^2,
   \]
   where \( J_1 \) is the Bessel function of the first kind, \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \), and \( a \) is the radius of the aperture (equal to the apothem for \( N \to \infty \)).

   The minima occur where \( J_1(k a \sin\theta) = 0 \). The zeros of \( J_1 \) are approximately \( x_1 = 3.8317 \), \( x_2 = 7.0156 \), \( x_3 = 10.1735 \), etc.

2. **Condition for Minima**:  
   The angular positions of the minima are determined by the condition:
   \[
   k a \sin\theta = x_m \quad \implies \quad \sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2\pi a}.
   \]
   For small angles, \( \sin\theta \approx \theta \), so:
   \[
   \theta_m \approx \frac{x_m \lambda}{2\pi a}.
   \]

3. **Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**:  
   - For \( m = 1 \) (first minimum):
     \[
     \theta_1 \approx \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
     \]
   - For \( m = 2 \) (second minimum):
     \[
     \theta_2 \approx \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
     \]

4. **Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**:  
   The angular distance between the first two minima is:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{2\pi a} \lambda.
   \]
   Substituting \( x_2 - x_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839 \):
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
   \]
   Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
   \[
   \Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern is approximately \( 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
