Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the chemist observes when running their product mixture on HPLC columns. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the question.

The problem involves two reactions with different starting alkenes: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then their products are combined and analyzed.

I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene might affect the product.

Wait, but what happens after the epoxidation? Oh right, sometimes epoxides can undergo ring-opening reactions. The question says they treat with aqueous acid after the mCPBA. So acid catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide.

In the ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions, the mechanism typically proceeds via a carbocation intermediate. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, which then forms a carbocation upon ring opening. The nucleophile (water in this case, since it's aqueous acid) attacks the more substituted carbocation because it's more stable.

Wait, but the starting material was an alkene. The geometry of the starting E and Z alkenes will influence the configuration of the epoxide, which in turn affects the ring-opening products.

Let me think about Reaction 1 first: (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. The E geometry means that the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. So when mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. For (E) alkenes, the epoxide might form two new stereocenters adjacent to each other. For example, in trans addition, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, mCPBA is a peracid that adds to the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to an epoxide where the oxygen has a specific stereochemistry. So for an E-alkene, the two new oxygen atoms (from mCPBA) add in a trans fashion, leading to a trans epoxide.

Wait, I might be getting that wrong. Let me think again. The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene typically forms an epoxide where the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to a cis epoxide? Or is it trans? Hmm, no, wait. The addition of the peracid across the double bond is a concerted process, so the oxygen adds with a specific stereochemistry, leading to the formation of a trans epoxide when the starting alkene is trans (E).

Wait, perhaps another approach. For the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene, the adding O atoms from mCPBA will be on opposite faces because the starting double bond is E. So the resulting epoxide would have the two new O groups on opposite sides, making the epoxide ring trans.

Wait, let me visualize. The E-alkene has the higher priority groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it adds across the double bond in such a way that the oxygen adds from the same face, I think. Or maybe opposite? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the structure of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For example, if the alkene is E, the epoxide will have a certain configuration, and if it's Z (same side), the epoxide will have another.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the diastereomers formed. When an epoxide is formed from an E-alkene, the two new stereocenters will be on opposite sides (trans), leading to a trans-dihydroxy epoxide.

Wait, no, epoxidation forms an epoxide, not dihydroxy. Oh right, the epoxide is an oxygen bridge between the two carbons. So in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form a trans configuration, and for (Z), a cis configuration.

So for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide with trans configuration. Then, under acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens.

In the ring-opening under acid, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation formed there is more stable. So in oct-4-ene's epoxide, both ends are secondary carbons. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no, octene is C8H16. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps better to write it as:

Structure of oct-4-ene: CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, more accurately, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, no, that's not right. Let me think: Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

But regardless, the key point is that upon epoxidation, each reaction gives a specific epoxide stereochemistry. Then, in acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens, leading to diols.

Wait, for each reaction, the epoxide is formed, and then when treated with acid and water, the epoxide opens to form a diol.

Wait a minute, the question says that the products are combined. So let's think about what each reaction gives.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, which is then treated with aqueous acid. So the epoxide ring opens to form a diol.

But how many stereoisomers are possible for each diol?

Wait, the diol is formed by the ring opening of an epoxide. The ring opening under acidic conditions involves the formation of a carbocation, then nucleophilic attack.

In the case of a symmetric epoxide, like what would form from (E)-oct-4-ene, perhaps the diol has certain stereochemistry.

Wait, let me think about the structure. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be a trans-diepoxide. So upon ring-opening, the diol would have a certain configuration.

Wait, but let's take a step back.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form between C4 and C5. The epoxide's oxygen is added across the double bond. Since the starting alkene is E, the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are on opposite sides, so when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides of the ring.

Wait, but for the ring-opening: when the epoxide is treated with acid, it protonates, and then the ring opens with nucleophilic attack. The attack occurs at the more substituted carbon, as that forms a more stable carbocation.

But in the case of oct-4-ene, both ends of the epoxide are secondary carbons. So the attack can occur at either end, but the carbocation would be the same in each case, leading to a racemic mixture or a single product?

Wait, but the epoxide is symmetric. No, because the substituents on either end are the same. Oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond, so the epoxide would be symmetric as well. So when the epoxide opens, the diol would have two possible configurations, but due to the symmetry, perhaps they are the same.

Wait, no. Let me think: if the epoxide is symmetric, then when it opens, would the diol have two stereocenters or just one?

Wait, no, the diol would have two stereocenters, but because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack on either side leads to the same diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of what each diastereomer would look like.

Let me consider (E)-oct-4-ene: structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5. The E geometry implies that the higher priority groups (probably the CH2CH2CH3) are opposite each other.

Upon epoxidation, the O adds across the double bond, leading to an epoxide. The diastereomer of the epoxide would determine how the ring opens.

But when the epoxide is treated with acid and water, the ring opens to form a diol. The diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration and the attack direction.

Wait, let's model it. Suppose the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, so the two oxygens are on opposite sides. When the ring opens, the attack can happen from either side, but the resulting diol would have two stereocenters.

Wait, let's say the epoxide is trans. The ring opening under acidic conditions would lead to the formation of a carbocation, and the nucleophile (water) attacks from either side.

Wait, but in this case, since both ends are symmetric, the diol formed would be a single compound. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, the attack can be from either face, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, in a symmetric epoxide, like the one from (E)-oct-4-ene, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would yield a single diastereomer, but possibly with two stereocenters. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single diastereomer because of the symmetry.

Alternatively, considering that the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have two identical stereocenters, leading to a meso compound. So the diol from the (E)-epoxide would be a single compound, a meso diol, meaning it has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, for example, if the diol is (2R,3S)- and (2S,3R)-, but due to the molecule's symmetry, these are the same, making it a meso compound. So the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene would be a single, achiral product.

Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide, which upon ring-opening under acidic conditions would form a different diol. Let me think about that.

In the (Z)-epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on the same side. So when the ring opens, the attack can occur from either side, leading to different configurations.

Wait, but wait—if the epoxide is from (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis, so the two oxygens are on the same face. When acid is added, the protonation occurs on one oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens, leading to a carbocation.

In this case, the attack by water can occur from either the same face or opposite, but perhaps in a way that leads to different stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps this setup leads to two different diastereomers. Let me think: if the epoxide is cis, then the attack could happen on the same face, leading to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on the same side.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to draw it out mentally. For the (Z)-epoxide, the two oxygens are on the same face. Upon ring-opening, the nucleophile (water) can attack either the same face or the opposite. But wait, in acid conditions, the attack is typically from the opposite face because the leaving group departs, opening the ring, and the nucleophile comes from the opposite side (SN2-like mechanism). Or is it more like SN1, where the nucleophile can attack from either side leading to possible racemization?

Wait, the ring-opening of epoxides under acidic conditions is typically an SN2 mechanism. So the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group (the protonated oxygen).

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like the (E)-epoxide, the attack on either end leads to the same product because of symmetry. So the diol would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral.

In the case of the (Z)-epoxide, which is also symmetric? Wait, no: (Z)-oct-4-ene's epoxide is also symmetric, right? Because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same as in the E case. So when you form the epoxide, it's also symmetric. So when the ring opens, the diol formed from the (Z) epoxide would have two stereocenters but would be a meso compound as well.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the diastereomers would depend on the starting epoxide's configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's think again: (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans epoxide, which upon ring-opening gives a diol that is a meso compound, so it's a single product.

(Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis epoxide. Upon ring-opening under acidic conditions, the attack occurs from the opposite side, leading to a diol with each hydroxyl group on the same side relative to the molecule. Wait, but because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack on either end would lead to the same product.

Wait, no, perhaps the diol from the cis epoxide is also a meso compound. So both reactions produce a single diol each, but the diols are different from each other.

Wait, that can't be right because (E) and (Z) would lead to different diastereomers. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but considering the starting material is either E or Z, maybe the products are different.

Wait, perhaps each epoxidation leads to two possible diastereomers, depending on the attack direction. But because of the reaction conditions, maybe each reaction only forms a single product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me approach this differently.

Each reaction produces a diol. The question is, how many stereoisomers are formed in each reaction, and what happens when they're combined.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → diol upon acid treatment.

Assuming the diol from Reaction 1 has two stereogenic centers. But because the starting epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral. So Reaction 1 gives one product.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → diol upon acid treatment.

Similarly, the diol from Reaction 2 would have two stereogenic centers. But due to the symmetry of the starting epoxide, the diol would also be a meso compound, so Reaction 2 gives another single product.

Wait, but if both reactions give a meso diol, that would mean the same product, which can't be right because the starting materials are different.

Wait, no. Let me think: (E) and (Z) alkenes are different. The diol from each would have different configurations, but both could be meso.

Wait, perhaps both diols are meso compounds but are different from each other. For example, (E) gives a certain meso diol, and (Z) gives a different meso diol, which would be enantiomeric or diastereomeric.

Wait, no. If both starting materials are symmetric, perhaps the diols are the same. But that doesn't make sense because the starting alkenes are E and Z.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), but in each case, the epoxide formed is symmetric. So when the diol forms, it's a meso compound in each case, but the two diols are enantiomers because the starting epoxide configurations are different.

Wait, no, because the (E) and (Z) epoxides would lead to different diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction yields two diastereomers, but due to the reaction conditions, each reaction produces a single diastereomer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the diols.

The diol from Reaction 1 (E epoxide) and Reaction 2 (Z epoxide) are different compounds. For example, the diol from the E epoxide may have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans) in the diol, while the diol from the Z epoxide may have them on the same side (cis), but considering the ring opening, perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, no. Let me think about the ring-opening. Suppose the epoxide is trans (from E), and when ring-opening occurs, the attack is from the same face, leading to a diol where both hydroxyls are on the same side. Wait, but no, the attack is from the opposite side in an SN2 mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the trans epoxide has the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, making it a meso compound, while the diol from the cis epoxide could be a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the diols from each reaction are diastereomers, each being a meso compound on their own. So in total, when combined, the products would have two distinct diastereomers, each of which is a meso compound.

Wait, but that would mean each diol is a single compound, so when combined, we have two products.

Wait, but the options suggest that the HPLC analysis shows more peaks. So perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, or each produces two stereoisomers, leading to a total of four products.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to two diastereomers, but they are mirror images, so when run on a chiral HPLC, they would be separated, but on an achiral column, they would appear as one peak.

Wait, no, because if the diastereomers are present, the standard HPLC would show separate peaks. But let's think again.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide upon ring-opening produces two diastereomers, but due to the reaction conditions, each reaction goes 100% to a single product. Wait, but the question says both reactions go to 100% completion, so each gives a single product.

So combining the two products gives two compounds. Then, when run on standard HPLC, which is achiral, if the two compounds are diastereomers, they would have different retention times, leading to two peaks. However, if they are enantiomers, they would have the same retention time on achiral columns but separate on chiral columns. So how many diastereomers are formed?

If Reaction 1 gives a meso diol (single compound), and Reaction 2 gives another meso diol (but different from the first), then each is a single compound. So combining them would give two different diastereomers. Thus, on standard HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each of these would be separated into their enantiomers. But wait, if each is a meso compound, they are achiral, so they would not have enantiomers. So on a chiral column, each meso compound would still be a single peak. Therefore, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well.

But wait, each meso diol is a single compound, so if you combine them, you have two different compounds, each of which is a meso form. Thus, on standard HPLC (achiral), each would be one peak, leading to two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each would still be a single peak because they are achiral, so two peaks again.

But that doesn't fit any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC
C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC
D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC

Wait, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each reaction leads to two diastereomers, but due to the reaction's 100% completion, each produces a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps in each reaction, the epoxide ring-opening leads to two possible diastereomers, but because of the reaction conditions (like acid), each reaction only forms one of them. But the problem states that both reactions go to 100% completion, so perhaps each reaction only produces one product.

Wait, but that would mean each reaction gives a single diastereomer, so combining them gives two compounds. Hence, standard HPLC would have two peaks, and chiral HPLC would have two peaks as well—so option C.

But another possibility is that each diol is a pair of enantiomers, but I don't think so. Because each diol is a meso compound, which is achiral, so no enantiomers.

Wait, but perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, each of which is a pair of enantiomers, but then the analysis gets more complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction gives two diastereomers, but due to the reaction conditions, each produces only one. Or maybe each reaction produces two diastereomers, so combining them would have four products.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

Each epoxide, upon acid treatment, would form a diol. For each epoxide, the diol could have two stereogenic centers. But if the diol is a meso compound, it would have two stereogenic centers but be achiral.

So, for each reaction, the product is a single meso diol.

If the two starting alkenes (E and Z) lead to different meso diols, then when you combine them, you have two different diols, each being a meso compound. So when running on a standard (achiral) HPLC, each would have a separate peak, leading to two peaks.

On a chiral column, each meso compound would still be a single peak because they're achiral. Hence, two peaks again.

But that would match option C: 2 peaks in both HPLC.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both, so that would be the case.

But wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, so combining them would give four products. If each diastereomer is present in the product mixture, then on standard HPLC, four peaks would appear, but on chiral HPLC, perhaps some are enantiomers and would merge.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to a total of four products when combined. Thus, in the product mixture, four diastereomers are present. But that would require that each epoxide ring opening leads to two diastereomers.

But wait, in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like the ones formed from (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene, the ring opening would produce a single diastereomer, a meso compound. So each reaction gives one product.

Then, when you combine the two reactions' products, you have two meso diols. These are two different compounds, so in standard HPLC (achiral), each would appear as a distinct peak, giving two peaks. On a chiral column, they would also appear as two peaks, since each is a single compound and not enantiomers.

Wait, but that would make both HPLC's show two peaks, so option C is the correct answer.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each reaction actually produces two diastereomers, which are then present in the mixture. So for each reaction, you have two products, leading to four in total. So standard HPLC would show four peaks, and chiral HPLC would show four as well. But that would match option A, but the options don't have that unless I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but due to the reaction conditions, only one forms. Wait, no, the problem says each reaction goes to 100% completion. So perhaps each reaction produces a single diastereomer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The same for (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, leading to diol formation.

In the case of (E)-epoxide:

The epoxide is trans. Upon acid treatment, the ring opens to form a diol. Because the epoxide is trans, the diol formed will have the two OH groups on opposite sides of the ring, leading to a meso compound. So Reaction 1 gives a single product, a meso diol.

Similarly, for (Z)-epoxide:

The epoxide is cis. Upon acid treatment, the diol formed will have the two OH groups on the same side, leading to another meso compound. Wait, no, because if the epoxide is cis, the attack would lead to a diol with both OHs on the same side, but whether that's a meso form depends on the structure.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so the diol from (E) is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z) is also a meso compound but a different one. So each reaction gives a single meso diol, which is a different compound from the other.

Thus, when combined, the mixture has two different meso diols.

On a standard HPLC (achiral), these two would appear as two separate peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, each meso diol would still be a single peak because they are achiral. So the chiral column would also show two peaks.

So the correct answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Looking back at the options, option C is "2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC." So the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene influences the configuration of the epoxide. Under acidic conditions, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**  
   - The (E)-oct-4-ene has opposite substituents on either side of the double bond. Reaction with mCPBA forms a **trans epoxide**.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the trans epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. Due to the symmetry of the starting material and the reaction conditions, the diol formed is a **meso compound** (a single achiral product).

2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**  
   - The (Z)-oct-4-ene has identical substituents on either side of the double bond. Reaction with mCPBA forms a **cis epoxide**.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the cis epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. Similarly, due to the symmetry of the starting material and the reaction conditions, the diol formed is also a **meso compound** (a single achiral product).  
   - The diol formed from the (Z)-epoxide is structurally different from the diol formed from the (E)-epoxide, making them two distinct meso compounds.

### Combining the Products:
- When the products of both reactions are combined, the mixture contains **two distinct meso diols**. These diols are diastereomers of each other but are achiral.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**:  
   - On an achiral column, diastereomers are separated into distinct peaks. Since there are two distinct meso diols, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - On a chiral column, enantiomers are separated into distinct peaks, but meso compounds (which are achiral and not enantiomeric to themselves) will appear as single peaks. Since there are two distinct meso diols, the chiral HPLC will also show **2 peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The chemist observes **2 peaks in both the standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms**.
