Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is periodic and depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

So, the data given is that planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's Doppler shift relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = (v) which depends on (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) multiplied by (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the formula might be K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / (c * (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * c)) ) ] * (something). Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital period P. Because K depends on the speed of the star's orbit, which relates to the planet's orbital speed. Since the period is the time it takes to orbit, a longer period would mean the star's speed is lower, leading to a smaller K (smaller Doppler shift). So if planet #2's shift is larger, that suggests a smaller period? Or the other way around.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / [ c * (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p (planet mass) is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / (c * M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Which can be rearranged as K ∝ M_p / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but what's varying here? Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. The stars are the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is the same. So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). 

So if K is larger, P must be smaller. Because K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So for planet #1, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet #2, K2 is 7. So K2 > K1 implies that P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3), so P2 < P1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is smaller, then the factor would be less than 1. But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, D is ~0.85, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should express the ratio of the periods. Let me think about K1 and K2.

Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, solving for (P2/P1):

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

But wait, let me double-check that.

If K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then K = A / P^(1/3), where A is a constant. So K1 = A / P1^(1/3), K2 = A / P2^(1/3).

Dividing K1 by K2: K1/K2 = (A/P1^(1/3)) / (A/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So yes, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We need (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, because if I rearrange:

(K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) => cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, wait no, let me be precise.

Let me write it again.

K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) => K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So for each planet:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Divide K1 by K2:

K1 / K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, but wait. I think I might have it backwards because if K is larger, the star's velocity is higher, which would mean faster orbital speed. Which would imply a shorter period since you go around faster.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Then, according to the formula, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → (P1/P2) = (K2/K1)^3 → So P1 = P2 * (K2/K1)^3

Which would mean that P2 is smaller than P1.

But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is smaller, then the factor is less than 1.

But the question is P2 / P1. So from the formula, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

So substituting K1=5, K2=7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter by a factor of ~0.36.

The question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the ratio is 0.36, meaning it's 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1; in other words, P2 is shorter. So the answer is that P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up K1 and K2. The question says planet #1 has a shift of 5, planet #2 has a shift of 7. So K1=5, K2=7.

So yes, K1/K2 = 5/7.

So, (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364, which is approximately 0.36. So the answer is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), as given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This relationship implies that if \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the semi-amplitudes for planet #1 and planet #2, respectively, then:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, and the answer is approximately 0.36.
