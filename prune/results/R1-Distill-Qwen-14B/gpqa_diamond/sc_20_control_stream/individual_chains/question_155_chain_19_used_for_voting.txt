Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The state is given as a column vector, and the operators P_x, P_y, P_z are provided in matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I remember are usually |+z> and |-z> states.

First, I think I need to recall how to compute the uncertainty in an observable. The formula for the uncertainty ΔA is the square root of the expectation value of A² minus the square of the expectation value of A. So ΔA = sqrt( <A²> - <A>² ). 

The operator in question here is P_z. So I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²>, then plug them into the formula.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, but wait—how many components does this vector have? Let me count: three components. So it's a 3x1 column vector. That suggests we're dealing with a three-level system, perhaps something like spin-1 or similar.

Wait, but for spin systems, the spin matrices usually have dimensions related to 2s+1. So for spin-1, s=1, so 3x3 matrices. That makes sense.

So, the operators P_x, P_y, P_z are 3x3 matrices. The given state is a 3-component vector.

The state is the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit form is given as the column vector. So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

But to compute the uncertainty in P_z, I need to work with the P_z operator and this state.

First, let me write down the matrix for P_z:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. The eigenvectors would be along the z-axis.

Now, the state |ψ> is given. But wait, is |ψ> an eigenstate of P_z? Probably not, because it's an eigenstate of P_x. So when we measure P_z, the state will collapse into one of the eigenstates of P_z, and the possible outcomes are ħ, 0, -ħ.

But for the uncertainty, I don't need to worry about the collapse; I just calculate the expectation values.

So, first, compute <P_z> = <ψ| P_z |ψ>.

Let me compute that. The state |ψ> is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

So, to compute <P_z>, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, P_z is diagonal, so maybe that's easier. Because when you multiply a vector with a diagonal matrix, you just scale each component.

So, P_z ψ would be:

First component: ħ * (-1/2)
Second component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2

So, P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. Since all the components are real here, the conjugate doesn't change anything. So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

Now, the inner product ψ† (P_z ψ) is the sum of each component multiplied:

( -1/2 ) * (-ħ/2 ) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + ( -1/2 ) * ( ħ/2 )

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) = ħ/4
Second term: 1/sqrt(2)*0 = 0
Third term: (-1/2)*( ħ/2 ) = -ħ/4

Adding them together: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

So <P_z> is zero. That's interesting.

Next, compute <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each element squared.

So, P_z² matrix:

Row 1: (ħ)^2, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0,0, (-ħ)^2 → ħ²

So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So, to compute <P_z²>:

Again, it's ψ† P_z² ψ.

So, let's compute P_z² ψ:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2
Second component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2 

So, P_z² ψ = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

So, inner product:

( -1/2 ) * ( -ħ²/2 ) + (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + ( -1/2 ) * (-ħ²/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4

Adding them: ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So <P_z²> is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is zero, uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the inner product $\langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$:

\[
\langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix form of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the inner product $\langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$:

\[
\langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$.

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
