Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are.

Hmm, wait, wait. First, let me make sure I understand the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, wait a second. Benzene rings are usually numbered in a way that substituents have the lowest possible numbers. So 1-bromo-2-d something... Wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene-2-dimethyl something. Wait, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 2-bromo-1-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, the way it's written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, maybe the 'd' stands for deuterium? Wait, maybe the compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Oh right, because in some cases, especially when dealing with deuterium, it's written as the suffix -d. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at the ortho position relative to the bromine. So the structure would be benzene with a Br at position 1 and a D (deuterium) at position 2.

Wait, so the structure is Br attached to carbon 1, and D attached to carbon 2. So the positions are adjacent: positions 1 and 2 are next to each other on the benzene ring.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, especially when dealing with deuterium, it can lead to elimination or substitution reactions. 

Wait, but in this case, the compound has Br and D on adjacent carbons. So when NaNH2 is added, perhaps it abstracts a proton. Wait, but in the ortho position, there's a deuterium. But wait, the starting molecule has a Br and a D on adjacent carbons. So I'm thinking about the possibility of elimination, like forming a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-d (deutero) benzene. So the structure is Br at position 1, D at position 2. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a good solvent for such reactions. So NaNH2 is a strong base, and can deprotonate things. But in this molecule, the H's adjacent to Br would be the ortho and para positions. Wait, but wait, maybe that's not the case here.

Wait a second, if the Br is at position 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. At position 2, there's a D, so the H's at position 6 would be available. So the base could abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe elimination occurs between Br and D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But in benzene, the ring is already conjugated, so forming a double bond adjacent to each other might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, resulting in a dehydrohalogenation reaction.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution reactions, the presence of strong bases like NaNH2 can lead to elimination. For example, when a benzene ring has a leaving group (like Br) and a hydrogen in a position that can lead to the formation of a double bond (like ortho or para), the base can abstract that hydrogen, and the leaving group (Br-) departs, forming a double bond. This would result in the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to where the Br was.

Wait, but wait. Let me try to think of this. If I have 1-bromo-2-d (deutero) benzene, and I treat it with NaNH2, which is a strong base. The base will abstract a proton that's beta to the Br, which would be the ortho and para positions. But in this case, the ortho position (position 2) has a deuterium, not a hydrogen. So the available hydrogens are only at the para position relative to the Br. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Br is at position 1. So the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, so the available hydrogens would be at position 6, perhaps. Or maybe at position 4? Wait, no. Let me draw the benzene ring.

Positions:
1 - Br
2 - D
3 - H
4 - H
5 - H
6 - H

Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So position 6 is adjacent to position 1 as well. So positions 6 and 2 are the ortho positions relative to Br (at position 1). So position 6 has a H. So the base, NaNH2, can abstract a proton from position 6. Then, the Br would leave, and a double bond would form between C1 and C6, right? So that would form a double bond between C1 and C6, making the ring have two adjacent double bonds? Or wait, no, because benzene is already a conjugated ring. Wait, maybe elimination would form a diene structure. Hmm, but benzene already has a conjugated system, so I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination would lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the Br. Let me think: when Br is at position 1, and the H is removed from position 2 (but position 2 has D, so maybe that's not possible). Wait, but in this case, position 2 has D, so the H is only available at position 6.

Wait, but in the case where the H is abstracted from position 6 (ortho to Br), then the Br would leave, and a double bond would form between C1 and C6, which is adjacent to position 2 (which has D). But wait, position 2 is D, so the double bond would be between C1 and C6, and C2 has D. Hmm, that's an interesting structure.

Wait, but wait. If the H is abstracted from position 6, then the base would form a carbanion at position 6, and Br would leave. So the mechanism would likely form a double bond between positions 1 and 6, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 6. But then, what about the D at position 2? That's adjacent to position 1, and the double bond is between 1 and 6. So this might form a meta director, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes a di-substituted benzene with a double bond.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d (deutero) benzene. After elimination, would the product be benzene with a double bond between 1 and 2? Or between 1 and 6? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let's think again. If the H is removed from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1, then the Br would leave, and a double bond would form between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzene ring where positions 1 and 6 are double-bonded, and position 2 has a D.

Wait, but position 2 is adjacent to position 1. So the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 6, and position 2 has a D. So that's one possible product. But wait, what if the H is abstracted from another position? No, because the only available protons are at position 6 and perhaps position 4? No, wait, position 4 is meta to Br at 1, so the H there would be para to Br. But the base would prefer to abstract a proton that's ortho to Br because that's where the hydrogen is beta to the leaving group, allowing for E2 elimination.

Wait, but in this case, the ortho position (position 2) has a D, so the base can't abstract a proton there. So the next available position is position 6, which is ortho to Br (position 1). So the base would abstract a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.

So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, the ring is already conjugated, so adding another double bond would change the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring would just become a substituted benzene with a double bond, but I'm not sure how that's possible.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the reaction again. The reaction is between 1-bromo-2-d benzene and NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base, and it's used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. So the base abstracts a proton that is adjacent to the leaving group (Br), leading to the formation of a double bond as the Br leaves.

In this case, the only available proton adjacent to Br is at position 6. So the base would abstract that H, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 6, and a D at position 2. So that's one product.

Wait, but wait. Could there be more than one product? Because sometimes elimination can occur in different positions, leading to different structures. But in this case, the starting material only has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the only possible elimination is between C1 and C6, because position 2 is taken by D, so no H there. So that would produce a single product.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a proton from a different position, leading to a different elimination. For instance, could the base abstract a proton from position 3, which is meta to Br? But that's not adjacent, so the elimination wouldn't form a double bond. So, probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, which is para to Br. But in that case, the H is not beta to Br, so elimination wouldn't occur. So no, that's unlikely.

So in this case, there's only one possible elimination product, which is the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. Therefore, the product is benzene with a double bond between 1 and 6 and a D at position 2.

Wait, but wait. The starting material has Br at 1 and D at 2. When elimination occurs, we lose Br and form a double bond between 1 and 6. So the product would be a di-substituted benzene with a double bond between 1 and 6 and a D at 2. So that's one product.

But wait, another possibility: Could the deuterium affect the reaction in any way? Like, maybe the presence of D could influence the acidity of the neighboring hydrogen. For example, maybe the presence of D at position 2 makes the H at position 6 more acidic, thereby making it easier for the base to abstract it. But I'm not sure if that affects the number of products.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, then the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 6, and a D at position 2. So that's one product.

Alternatively, is there another site of elimination? Let me think again. The Br is at position 1. The H's available are only at position 6 (ortho), and maybe the para position, which is position 4. But the para position's H would not be beta to Br, so elimination wouldn't occur there. So I think only one product is possible.

Wait, but wait. What if the reaction doesn't just eliminate Br but also undergoes some kind of substitution, but that seems unlikely under these conditions. NaNH2 is more about elimination than substitution. Substitution would require a good leaving group and perhaps a nucleophile, but here, the solvent is ammonia, which is a base, not a nucleophile in this case.

Alternatively, could the reaction form a benzene ring with a triple bond? No, that's probably not the case. It's more likely to form a double bond.

So, I think there's only one product formed from this reaction. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1.

Wait, but let me double-check. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When NaNH2 abstracts a proton from position 6, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. So the product is benzene with a double bond between 1 and 6 and a D at position 2. That's one product.

Are there any other possible eliminations? Like, maybe if the base abstracts a proton from a different position, but as I thought earlier, the only possible H to abstract is at position 6. So, I think only one product forms.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that facilitates dehydrohalogenation by abstracting a proton β to the leaving group (Br), leading to the formation of a double bond.

In this case, the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. The available hydrogens for elimination are at position 6 (ortho to Br) and position 4 (para to Br). However, elimination typically occurs at the ortho position (position 6) because it is β to the leaving group (Br). The base abstracts the hydrogen at position 6, resulting in the elimination of Br and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. 

The product is a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 and a deuterium at position 2. No other elimination positions are feasible because the hydrogens at position 4 are not β to Br, and the hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by deuterium. Therefore, only one product is formed in this reaction.

Answer: B
