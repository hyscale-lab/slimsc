Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let's think about what that structure looks like. Ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right? So the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (C=O) at position 1. Then, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Oh wait, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me visualize it: the ketone is on the benzene ring at position 1. Then, at position 3, there's a bromine, and at position 5, a nitro group. So the ring has substituents at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone at position 1.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering: if the ketone is on position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent, and positions 3 and 5 are opposite to position 1. So substituents at 3 and 5—so meta to each other relative to the ketone?

So the synthesis starts with benzene. We need to figure out the sequence of reactions to get to this compound.

Looking at the options, each option gives a series of reactions. Let's think about the possible reactions and their order.

First, what's the target? It has a ketone (from acetophenone), a bromine, and a nitro group. So the substituents are a ketone (electron-withdrawing), nitro (also strong electron-withdrawing), and bromine (which is a leaving group and also EWG).

So, benzene is the starting material. Let's consider the order of substitution. Nitration and bromination are typical electrophilic substitutions. Acetophenone is made via Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Benzene is not activated, so the ring must have activating groups before Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, the acylation could come early if the other substituents are already in place.

Wait, but the target has two nitro groups? No, wait, let me check. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl ring has three substituents: at position 1: the ketone (from ethan-1-one, which is R-CO- attached to benzene). Then, positions 3 and 5 have Br and NO2.

Wait, but in benzene, if the ketone is at position 1, then the other substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Let me think of the structure. So the ring has three substituents: ketone (position 1), Br (position 3), nitro (position 5). So that would make the substituents in a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. So, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So when you have multiple substituents, the directing effects can be complex. So the order in which substituents are added matters because each step directs the next substitution.

So let's think about the steps:

1. Benzene → introduce a nitro group. Nitration of benzene is done with HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene is nitrated to produce nitrobenzene.

2. Then, perhaps introduce a bromine. Bromination of nitrobenzene would require a catalyst like FeBr3. But wait, nitro is a meta director. So if the first substituent is nitro at position 1, then bromine would enter at position 3 or 5 (since nitro directs meta). But wait, after nitration, the next substitution would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring becomes deactivating (since nitro is EWG), so the next substitution would be more difficult. But if we do nitration first, then bromination, then perhaps introducing the ketone.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group. If the ring is deactivated (has nitro groups), Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, if nitration is done early, maybe we can't proceed to acylation unless there's an activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done before nitration. Let's think: if we first acylate benzene to make acetophenone. Then, nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would occur where?

Wait, acetophenone (phenyl ketone) has the ketone group, which is a meta director. So after acylation, the next substituent (nitro?) would enter at the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would be another substitution, directed by the nitro group, perhaps.

But wait, the target has both nitro and bromine substituents. So perhaps the order is: acylation, nitration, bromination.

But I need to account for the positions.

Wait, let's think about the substituent positions. The target has the ketone at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So the substituents are at 1,3,5. So in a benzene ring, 1,3,5 are all adjacent in a triangle. Wait, benzene ring is a hexagon, so 1,3,5 are every other carbon, which would actually form a kind of 'trigonal' arrangement.

So, let's say we have the ketone at position 1. Then, nitro at position 3, and bromine at position 5.

Wait, but how do these substituents get into their positions? Let's consider the possible reaction sequences.

Another approach: think about the possible positions when substituents are added in different orders.

If we first acylate benzene to make acetophenone (position 1), then nitrate. The nitration would occur meta to the ketone group, which is position 3 or 5. Since the ring is para to the ketone is position 4, but meta is positions 3 and 5. But in mono-substituted benzene, the meta would be two possible positions. But for a symmetrical ring, it's the same.

So after nitration, the nitro group would be at position 3 or 5. Let's say it's at position 3. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2). Then, bromination would occur where? The next substituent would be directed by the existing groups.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director. So when two meta directors are present, where would the next substituent go?

Hmm, perhaps the substituents will direct the next group into a position that is meta to both. Let me think: if we have substituents at 1 and 3, where would the next group go?

Wait, the positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2). The next substituent would be added in a position that is favored by both. Let's see: the nitro group is at 3, so it directs to position 6 (meta to 3) or position 5 (ortho to 3). Wait, no, meta to 3 would be position 6, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group at 3 and the ketone at 1 create a di-substituted ring. The next substituent (bromine) would be directed by the strongest director. Since nitro is a stronger deactivating group than the ketone, perhaps it would dominate.

So, nitro is at 3. The next substituent would be directed meta to nitro, which would be position 6. But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 5. Hmm, but the target has bromine at position 5.

Wait, maybe I should consider another approach. Let me think about the possible reaction sequences in the options.

Looking at option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, but if we acylate first, making acetophenone, then nitrate. Nitro would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, so positions 3 or 5. Then, bromination would have to go into another position, perhaps position 5 or 3, but since the nitro is there, the bromine would be directed by the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine comes before nitration. Wait, but that would require activating the ring for bromination. Benzene is not very reactive without a catalyst. So bromination of benzene needs FeBr3. But if you have a substituent that's activating, then perhaps.

Wait, if we brominate benzene first with FeBr3, that gives bromobenzene. Then, nitration would occur at the meta position relative to bromine, which is a meta director. So nitro would go at position 5 if bromine is at position 3 (assuming starting numbering so that bromine is at 3, then nitro at 5). Then, acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would require the ring to be activated. Wait, but nitro is deactivating. So after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed.

Ah, that could be a problem. Because after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so you can't do Friedel-Crafts. So that might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done before nitration. So:

Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone. Then, nitration, which would add nitro group meta to the ketone. Then, bromination would be added where?

Wait, in acetophenone, the ketone is a meta director. So after nitration, nitro is at 3 or 5. Let's say 3. Then bromine would be added where? Since the ring is now substituted with ketone (1) and nitro (3), the next substituent would be directed by the nitro group (stronger EWG) to a meta position, which would be position 6. But the target has bromine at 5.

Hmm, that doesn't line up.

Alternatively, maybe the nitration happens after the bromine.

Wait, but let's think again. If we have acetophenone, then brominate. But wait, benzene is deactivated after acylation? No, acetophenone is an activating group (the ketone is ortho/para directing but deactivating because it's an EWG). Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts introduces an acyl group which is a meta director and deactivating. So after acylation, the ring is less reactive but still can undergo substitution, albeit more slowly.

So, after acylation, benzene becomes acetophenone. Then bromination: where would Br add? Since the ketone is a meta director, bromine would be added at position 3 or 5. Suppose we add Br at position 3. Now the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Then, nitration would happen where? The Br is a meta director, so nitration would add at position 5 (if Br is at 3, meta would be position 6 but that's adjacent to position 1; wait, perhaps I got the positions wrong.

Wait, acetophenone: the ketone is at position 1. So the substituents positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but how can that happen? Let me think about the possible directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then acetylation, then bromination. But that would require the ring to be activated for acylation, which might not be possible if nitro is present.

Wait, nitro groups deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult. So if we nitrate first, then we can't acylate because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, that brings me back to considering that the acylation must happen before nitration. Because after acylation, the ring is still reactive enough to undergo nitration, though perhaps less reactive than benzene.

So, step 1: acylation → acetophenone.

Step 2: nitration → nitro group at meta position relative to ketone (so position 3 or 5).

Then, step 3: bromination. Where? Now, the ring has ketone (1) and nitro (3 or 5). The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the next substituent (Br) would be added meta to nitro.

If nitro is at 3, then meta would be position 6. But in the target, Br is at position 3. Hmm, but that's where the nitro is. No, wait, target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, maybe I got the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced after the Br.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the target molecule again.

The substituents are at positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, in a benzene ring, the substituents are at 1,3,5. So, they're all meta to each other.

Wait, so if we have three substituents, each meta to the others. So maybe the order of substitution is important to get all three in the right positions.

Let me think of a possible sequence:

1. Introduce the ketone (acylation) → acetophenone (position 1).
2. Introduce Br → since the ketone is meta-directing, Br could go to position 3 or 5.
3. Then, introduce NO2 group, which would be directed by the Br (which is a meta director) to position 5 or something.

Wait, but the nitration step comes after bromination. So, after Br is at position 3, nitration would occur where?

Wait, the substituents are at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br). The nitro group would be directed by the Br group. Br is a meta director, so nitration would occur at position 5 or position 6. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to think of the positions. Benzene ring, position 1 has COCH3, position 3 has Br. The nitration would then add at position 5, which is meta to Br (position 3). So that would give the substituents at 1,3,5: COCH3, Br, and NO2. Which matches the target.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (position 1).
2. Brominate → Br at position 3 (meta to ketone).
3. Nitrate → NO2 at position 5 (meta to Br).

But wait, can we get Br at position 3 after acetylation? Let's see. Acetophenone is a meta director, so when we perform bromination, Br would enter at the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3 or 5. So let's say position 3. Then, the next step is nitration, which is directed by the Br group, which is a meta director. So nitration would go to position 6? Wait, no. Wait, if Br is at 3, then meta would be position 6 (since 3 + 3 = 6? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 3's meta positions are positions 6 and... wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, each position has two meta positions. For position 1, meta are 3 and 5. For position 3, meta would be 5 and 1? Wait, no. Let me think of the ring as positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 arranged in a circle.

The meta positions for each are two away. So for position 1, meta is 3 and 5. For position 3, meta is 5 and 1. Wait, but position 1 is already occupied by the ketone, so nitration would go to position 5.

So, after Br is at 3, nitration would add at 5. That gives us the substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), which is exactly the target.

So this seems correct. Now, the question is whether the reaction steps allow this.

So the steps would be: acylation → bromination → nitration.

Looking at the options, which option follows this order?

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination, but that would be before acylation. That's not the order we want.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration first), which would be problematic because after nitration, acylation won't proceed.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate first. No.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation) → yes. Then ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So that's the order: acylation → bromination → nitration.

So in option A, the steps are:

i) acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) bromination → Br added at position 3 (meta to ketone).

iii) nitration → NO2 added at position 5 (meta to Br).

That would give the correct substituents.

Wait, but let's check the entire option A. Let's see what all the steps are.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation of benzene → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → Br at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → NO2 at position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → what's this? Fe/HCl is probably for a later step, but in our target, after nitration, do we need any more steps? Let me think.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is acetophenone with substituents at 3 and 5. So after nitration, we're done. So why are there more steps?

Looking at option A, after step iii), there are more steps: iv) Fe/HCl, which is likely for a reduction. v) HNO3/H2SO4 again. vi) NaNO2/HCl. vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target. Let me reread the target: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

Ethan-1-one implies that the ketone is at the end of a two-carbon chain, so the structure is (phenyl-3-bromo-5-nitro) attached to a ketone (COCH3, perhaps? Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)C=O-Ph.

Wait, no. Ethyl group is two carbons. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-Ph. So the ketone is directly attached to the benzene ring: Ph-C(=O)-CH3.

So, after the initial acylation, we have Ph-C(=O)-CH3.

So the substituents on the ring are Br at 3 and NO2 at 5.

In option A, after steps i, ii, iii, the ring would have these substituents. But then the steps iv to vii are additional.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the nitration in step iii is done correctly. Let me think: after acylation and bromination, when we nitrate, where does it go?

Wait, in step iii, after having Br at 3, nitration would occur meta to Br, which is position 6. But the target needs nitro at position 5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the ring:

Positions:

1 → COCH3 (from acylation)

3 → Br (from bromination)

Nitration needs to go to position 5. So, when the ring has substituents at 1 and 3 (both EWG), the next substitution is directed by which group? The substituents are both meta directors. So, the strongest director is nitro, but nitro isn't present yet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach is to think about the possible reaction sequences in the options and see which leads to the correct substituents.

Let me think about each option.

Option A:

i) AcCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3 → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? I don't know. Then v) HNO3 again → another nitration? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii) are for a different purpose. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iii) isn't working, and another nitration is done.

But in the target, there's only one nitro group. So steps v) in option A also nitrate again, which would add another nitro group. That's not desired.

So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro group meta to Br → position 5.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But the ring has Br (deactivating) and nitro (deactivating), making it difficult to acylate. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, so if the ring is deactivated, this step might not work. So perhaps option B is invalid.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that's unlikely because Fe/HCl is not a typical reducing agent for nitro groups. Alternatively, perhaps to make a benzyl chloride? Not sure.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But the ring is deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts might not proceed. So this option is probably wrong.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine?

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps for some reaction, maybe a Sandmeyer reaction? But I'm not sure how that fits. Then steps v) Br2 → bromination.

vi) AcCl → acylation.

vii) HNO3 again.

This seems to involve multiple steps, but the initial steps would likely deactivate the ring, making acylation difficult.

So perhaps I should focus back on option A.

Wait, what if the order is acylation, nitration, bromination? Let's think.

After acylation at 1, nitration would add nitro at 3 (meta to ketone). Then, bromination would add Br at a position directed by nitro and the ketone.

Wait, but in which position would Br go? Nitro at 3 is meta, so Br would go to position 6 or 5? Hmm.

Wait, when ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2), the next substituent (Br) would be directed preferably by the stronger director. Nitro is a stronger deactivating group than the ketone, so it would direct incoming groups to its meta positions. Position 6 is adjacent to position 1, which has the ketone. Maybe not the best position.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br would go to position 5, which is meta to nitro (position 3).

Wait, the nitro is at 3, so meta would be 6 and 5? Wait, position 3's meta positions are 1 and 5. But position 1 is already occupied. So perhaps the Br would go to position 5.

So the substituents would be:

1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), 5 (Br). But the target has Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the order should be: nitration first, then acylation, then bromination.

But, as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so acylation might not work.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the synthesis involving nitration, then acylation, then bromide.

But again, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making acylation difficult. So perhaps Friedel-Crafts isn't feasible. Unless the nitration is done in such a way that the acylation can still proceed.

Alternatively, maybe nitration is done after acylation and bromination.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acylation → bromination → nitration, as in option A.

So, after acylation, bromination puts Br at 3. Then nitration puts NO2 at 5 (meta to Br). That seems correct.

So, in that case, the steps in option A would be:

i) acylation → acetophenone.

ii) bromination → Br at 3.

iii) nitration → NO2 at 5.

But option A has more steps after iii. Let me look again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → FeCl or something else? Maybe a reduction.

Wait, but after nitration, do we need to do anything else? The target is already achieved after steps i, ii, iii.

So why are there more steps? Perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the nitration isn't the last step.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So after the nitration step, the substituents are in place. So why would there be further steps like iv, v, etc.?

Hmm, perhaps some of the steps are for protection or other functional group transformations. Alternatively, maybe the order isn't correctly represented in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration isn't done at the ring but on a side chain. But that doesn't seem to apply here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitration step in option A is performed in a way that adds another nitro group. But the target only has one nitro group. So that would be a problem.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is done after some reduction steps. Let me think about step iv in option A: Fe/HCl. Fe and HCl could be for reducing nitro groups to amines, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back. The correct synthesis steps should be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → NO2 at 5.

Which is exactly what option A does in steps i, ii, iii. The rest of the steps (iv to vii) are extra and may not be part of the correct sequence. So perhaps the correct option is A.

But why are the other steps present? Maybe the options include all steps, but only the first three are needed. Or perhaps the other steps are for some other purpose, but they don't affect the substituent positions.

Wait, maybe the question is about the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps some steps are involved in activating or deactivating the ring for the next substitution.

Wait, another thought: after acylation, the ring is less reactive, so nitration may not proceed unless the ring is activated. But wait, nitration is a strong reaction and can occur even with a less activated ring. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration needs to be done in a specific position.

Alternatively, maybe option B is correct.

Wait, in option B, the steps are: bromination first, then nitration, then acylation. But as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making acylation difficult.

So, perhaps option B isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the nitration step is done after the bromide is introduced, but in a way that the nitro group is added in the correct position relative to both substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Brominate → Br at 5 (meta to nitro).

But then the substituents would be at 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), 5 (Br). Which is the same as the target.

So, let's see which option does that.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at meta → position 5.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But the ring is now substituted with Br (3) and nitro (5), both EWG, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So this option is invalid.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But nitro is gone, replaced by amine. Benzene now has an NH2 group, which is activating. So acylation can proceed. Then bromination, etc.

But in that case, the substituents would be in different positions.

Wait, let me think. In option C:

i) nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → I think Fe/HCl is for the Rosenmund reduction (to reduce esters to aldehydes), but in this context, perhaps it's for something else. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is not a strong enough reducing agent for nitro groups. Nitro groups are typically reduced with H2/Pd or Sn/HCl. So perhaps this step is for something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The correct sequence is acylation → bromination → nitration, which is steps i, ii, iii in option A. That would give the substituents in the correct positions. So option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (ketone, bromine, and nitro group) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has a ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5, forming a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Acetylation of benzene using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ produces acetophenone (ketone at position 1).  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds a nitro group at position 5 (meta to bromine).  
   This sequence correctly places all substituents in the desired positions. The additional steps (iv–vii) in this option are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and do not affect the outcome.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination of benzene with Br₂/FeBr₃ produces bromobenzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds a nitro group at position 5 (meta to bromine).  
   - **Step iii**: Acetylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ attempts to introduce the ketone. However, the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation unlikely to proceed.  
   This sequence is invalid due to the inability to acetylate the deactivated ring.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration of benzene with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ produces nitrobenzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is likely intended for reduction, but it is not strong enough to reduce a nitro group.  
   - **Step iii**: Acetylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.  
   This sequence is invalid due to the inability to acetylate the deactivated ring.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration of benzene with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ produces nitrobenzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is likely intended for reduction, but it is not strong enough to reduce a nitro group.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl and subsequent steps are unnecessary and do not align with the target molecule.  
   This sequence is invalid as it does not lead to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is provided in **Option A**, where acetylation, bromination, and nitration are performed in the correct order to yield the target molecule. The additional steps in Option A are extraneous but do not interfere with the synthesis.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, let's think about what that structure looks like. Ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right? So the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (C=O) at position 1. Then, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Oh wait, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me visualize it: the ketone is on the benzene ring at position 1. Then, at position 3, there's a bromine, and at position 5, a nitro group. So the ring has substituents at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone at position 1.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering: if the ketone is on position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent, and positions 3 and 5 are opposite to position 1. So substituents at 3 and 5—so meta to each other relative to the ketone?

So the synthesis starts with benzene. We need to figure out the sequence of reactions to get to this compound.

Looking at the options, each option gives a series of reactions. Let's think about the possible reactions and their order.

First, what's the target? It has a ketone (from acetophenone), a bromine, and a nitro group. So the substituents are a ketone (electron-withdrawing), nitro (also strong electron-withdrawing), and bromine (which is a leaving group and also EWG).

So, benzene is the starting material. Let's consider the order of substitution. Nitration and bromination are typical electrophilic substitutions. Acetophenone is made via Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Benzene is not activated, so the ring must have activating groups before Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, the acylation could come early if the other substituents are already in place.

Wait, but the target has two nitro groups? No, wait, let me check. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl ring has three substituents: at position 1: the ketone (from ethan-1-one, which is R-CO- attached to benzene). Then, positions 3 and 5 have Br and NO2.

Wait, but in benzene, if the ketone is at position 1, then the other substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Let me think of the structure. So the ring has three substituents: ketone (position 1), Br (position 3), nitro (position 5). So that would make the substituents in a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring. So, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So when you have multiple substituents, the directing effects can be complex. So the order in which substituents are added matters because each step directs the next substitution.

So let's think about the steps:

1. Benzene → introduce a nitro group. Nitration of benzene is done with HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene is nitrated to produce nitrobenzene.

2. Then, perhaps introduce a bromine. Bromination of nitrobenzene would require a catalyst like FeBr3. But wait, nitro is a meta director. So if the first substituent is nitro at position 1, then bromine would enter at position 3 or 5 (since nitro directs meta). But wait, after nitration, the next substitution would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring becomes deactivating (since nitro is EWG), so the next substitution would be more difficult. But if we do nitration first, then bromination, then perhaps introducing the ketone.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group. If the ring is deactivated (has nitro groups), Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, if nitration is done early, maybe we can't proceed to acylation unless there's an activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done before nitration. Let's think: if we first acylate benzene to make acetophenone. Then, nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would occur where?

Wait, acetophenone (phenyl ketone) has the ketone group, which is a meta director. So after acylation, the next substituent (nitro?) would enter at the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, bromination would be another substitution, directed by the nitro group, perhaps.

But wait, the target has both nitro and bromine substituents. So perhaps the order is: acylation, nitration, bromination.

But I need to account for the positions.

Wait, let's think about the substituent positions. The target has the ketone at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So the substituents are at 1,3,5. So in a benzene ring, 1,3,5 are all adjacent in a triangle. Wait, benzene ring is a hexagon, so 1,3,5 are every other carbon, which would actually form a kind of 'trigonal' arrangement.

So, let's say we have the ketone at position 1. Then, nitro at position 3, and bromine at position 5.

Wait, but how do these substituents get into their positions? Let's consider the possible reaction sequences.

Another approach: think about the possible positions when substituents are added in different orders.

If we first acylate benzene to make acetophenone (position 1), then nitrate. The nitration would occur meta to the ketone group, which is position 3 or 5. Since the ring is para to the ketone is position 4, but meta is positions 3 and 5. But in mono-substituted benzene, the meta would be two possible positions. But for a symmetrical ring, it's the same.

So after nitration, the nitro group would be at position 3 or 5. Let's say it's at position 3. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2). Then, bromination would occur where? The next substituent would be directed by the existing groups.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director. So when two meta directors are present, where would the next substituent go?

Hmm, perhaps the substituents will direct the next group into a position that is meta to both. Let me think: if we have substituents at 1 and 3, where would the next group go?

Wait, the positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2). The next substituent would be added in a position that is favored by both. Let's see: the nitro group is at 3, so it directs to position 6 (meta to 3) or position 5 (ortho to 3). Wait, no, meta to 3 would be position 6, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group at 3 and the ketone at 1 create a di-substituted ring. The next substituent (bromine) would be directed by the strongest director. Since nitro is a stronger deactivating group than the ketone, perhaps it would dominate.

So, nitro is at 3. The next substituent would be directed meta to nitro, which would be position 6. But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 5. Hmm, but the target has bromine at position 5.

Wait, maybe I should consider another approach. Let me think about the possible reaction sequences in the options.

Looking at option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is: acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, but if we acylate first, making acetophenone, then nitrate. Nitro would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, so positions 3 or 5. Then, bromination would have to go into another position, perhaps position 5 or 3, but since the nitro is there, the bromine would be directed by the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine comes before nitration. Wait, but that would require activating the ring for bromination. Benzene is not very reactive without a catalyst. So bromination of benzene needs FeBr3. But if you have a substituent that's activating, then perhaps.

Wait, if we brominate benzene first with FeBr3, that gives bromobenzene. Then, nitration would occur at the meta position relative to bromine, which is a meta director. So nitro would go at position 5 if bromine is at position 3 (assuming starting numbering so that bromine is at 3, then nitro at 5). Then, acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would require the ring to be activated. Wait, but nitro is deactivating. So after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed.

Ah, that could be a problem. Because after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so you can't do Friedel-Crafts. So that might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done before nitration. So:

Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone. Then, nitration, which would add nitro group meta to the ketone. Then, bromination would be added where?

Wait, in acetophenone, the ketone is a meta director. So after nitration, nitro is at 3 or 5. Let's say 3. Then bromine would be added where? Since the ring is now substituted with ketone (1) and nitro (3), the next substituent would be directed by the nitro group (stronger EWG) to a meta position, which would be position 6. But the target has bromine at 5.

Hmm, that doesn't line up.

Alternatively, maybe the nitration happens after the bromine.

Wait, but let's think again. If we have acetophenone, then brominate. But wait, benzene is deactivated after acylation? No, acetophenone is an activating group (the ketone is ortho/para directing but deactivating because it's an EWG). Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts introduces an acyl group which is a meta director and deactivating. So after acylation, the ring is less reactive but still can undergo substitution, albeit more slowly.

So, after acylation, benzene becomes acetophenone. Then bromination: where would Br add? Since the ketone is a meta director, bromine would be added at position 3 or 5. Suppose we add Br at position 3. Now the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Then, nitration would happen where? The Br is a meta director, so nitration would add at position 5 (if Br is at 3, meta would be position 6 but that's adjacent to position 1; wait, perhaps I got the positions wrong.

Wait, acetophenone: the ketone is at position 1. So the substituents positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but how can that happen? Let me think about the possible directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then acetylation, then bromination. But that would require the ring to be activated for acylation, which might not be possible if nitro is present.

Wait, nitro groups deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult. So if we nitrate first, then we can't acylate because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, that brings me back to considering that the acylation must happen before nitration. Because after acylation, the ring is still reactive enough to undergo nitration, though perhaps less reactive than benzene.

So, step 1: acylation → acetophenone.

Step 2: nitration → nitro group at meta position relative to ketone (so position 3 or 5).

Then, step 3: bromination. Where? Now, the ring has ketone (1) and nitro (3 or 5). The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the next substituent (Br) would be added meta to nitro.

If nitro is at 3, then meta would be position 6. But in the target, Br is at position 3. Hmm, but that's where the nitro is. No, wait, target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, maybe I got the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced after the Br.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the target molecule again.

The substituents are at positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, in a benzene ring, the substituents are at 1,3,5. So, they're all meta to each other.

Wait, so if we have three substituents, each meta to the others. So maybe the order of substitution is important to get all three in the right positions.

Let me think of a possible sequence:

1. Introduce the ketone (acylation) → acetophenone (position 1).
2. Introduce Br → since the ketone is meta-directing, Br could go to position 3 or 5.
3. Then, introduce NO2 group, which would be directed by the Br (which is a meta director) to position 5 or something.

Wait, but the nitration step comes after bromination. So, after Br is at position 3, nitration would occur where?

Wait, the substituents are at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br). The nitro group would be directed by the Br group. Br is a meta director, so nitration would occur at position 5 or position 6. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to think of the positions. Benzene ring, position 1 has COCH3, position 3 has Br. The nitration would then add at position 5, which is meta to Br (position 3). So that would give the substituents at 1,3,5: COCH3, Br, and NO2. Which matches the target.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (position 1).
2. Brominate → Br at position 3 (meta to ketone).
3. Nitrate → NO2 at position 5 (meta to Br).

But wait, can we get Br at position 3 after acetylation? Let's see. Acetophenone is a meta director, so when we perform bromination, Br would enter at the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3 or 5. So let's say position 3. Then, the next step is nitration, which is directed by the Br group, which is a meta director. So nitration would go to position 6? Wait, no. Wait, if Br is at 3, then meta would be position 6 (since 3 + 3 = 6? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 3's meta positions are positions 6 and... wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, each position has two meta positions. For position 1, meta are 3 and 5. For position 3, meta would be 5 and 1? Wait, no. Let me think of the ring as positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 arranged in a circle.

The meta positions for each are two away. So for position 1, meta is 3 and 5. For position 3, meta is 5 and 1. Wait, but position 1 is already occupied by the ketone, so nitration would go to position 5.

So, after Br is at 3, nitration would add at 5. That gives us the substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), which is exactly the target.

So this seems correct. Now, the question is whether the reaction steps allow this.

So the steps would be: acylation → bromination → nitration.

Looking at the options, which option follows this order?

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination, but that would be before acylation. That's not the order we want.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration first), which would be problematic because after nitration, acylation won't proceed.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate first. No.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation) → yes. Then ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So that's the order: acylation → bromination → nitration.

So in option A, the steps are:

i) acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) bromination → Br added at position 3 (meta to ketone).

iii) nitration → NO2 added at position 5 (meta to Br).

That would give the correct substituents.

Wait, but let's check the entire option A. Let's see what all the steps are.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation of benzene → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination → Br at position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → NO2 at position 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → what's this? Fe/HCl is probably for a later step, but in our target, after nitration, do we need any more steps? Let me think.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is acetophenone with substituents at 3 and 5. So after nitration, we're done. So why are there more steps?

Looking at option A, after step iii), there are more steps: iv) Fe/HCl, which is likely for a reduction. v) HNO3/H2SO4 again. vi) NaNO2/HCl. vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target. Let me reread the target: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

Ethan-1-one implies that the ketone is at the end of a two-carbon chain, so the structure is (phenyl-3-bromo-5-nitro) attached to a ketone (COCH3, perhaps? Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)C=O-Ph.

Wait, no. Ethyl group is two carbons. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-Ph. So the ketone is directly attached to the benzene ring: Ph-C(=O)-CH3.

So, after the initial acylation, we have Ph-C(=O)-CH3.

So the substituents on the ring are Br at 3 and NO2 at 5.

In option A, after steps i, ii, iii, the ring would have these substituents. But then the steps iv to vii are additional.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the nitration in step iii is done correctly. Let me think: after acylation and bromination, when we nitrate, where does it go?

Wait, in step iii, after having Br at 3, nitration would occur meta to Br, which is position 6. But the target needs nitro at position 5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the ring:

Positions:

1 → COCH3 (from acylation)

3 → Br (from bromination)

Nitration needs to go to position 5. So, when the ring has substituents at 1 and 3 (both EWG), the next substitution is directed by which group? The substituents are both meta directors. So, the strongest director is nitro, but nitro isn't present yet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach is to think about the possible reaction sequences in the options and see which leads to the correct substituents.

Let me think about each option.

Option A:

i) AcCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3 → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? I don't know. Then v) HNO3 again → another nitration? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii) are for a different purpose. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iii) isn't working, and another nitration is done.

But in the target, there's only one nitro group. So steps v) in option A also nitrate again, which would add another nitro group. That's not desired.

So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro group meta to Br → position 5.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But the ring has Br (deactivating) and nitro (deactivating), making it difficult to acylate. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, so if the ring is deactivated, this step might not work. So perhaps option B is invalid.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that's unlikely because Fe/HCl is not a typical reducing agent for nitro groups. Alternatively, perhaps to make a benzyl chloride? Not sure.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But the ring is deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts might not proceed. So this option is probably wrong.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine?

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps for some reaction, maybe a Sandmeyer reaction? But I'm not sure how that fits. Then steps v) Br2 → bromination.

vi) AcCl → acylation.

vii) HNO3 again.

This seems to involve multiple steps, but the initial steps would likely deactivate the ring, making acylation difficult.

So perhaps I should focus back on option A.

Wait, what if the order is acylation, nitration, bromination? Let's think.

After acylation at 1, nitration would add nitro at 3 (meta to ketone). Then, bromination would add Br at a position directed by nitro and the ketone.

Wait, but in which position would Br go? Nitro at 3 is meta, so Br would go to position 6 or 5? Hmm.

Wait, when ring has substituents at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (NO2), the next substituent (Br) would be directed preferably by the stronger director. Nitro is a stronger deactivating group than the ketone, so it would direct incoming groups to its meta positions. Position 6 is adjacent to position 1, which has the ketone. Maybe not the best position.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br would go to position 5, which is meta to nitro (position 3).

Wait, the nitro is at 3, so meta would be 6 and 5? Wait, position 3's meta positions are 1 and 5. But position 1 is already occupied. So perhaps the Br would go to position 5.

So the substituents would be:

1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), 5 (Br). But the target has Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the order should be: nitration first, then acylation, then bromination.

But, as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so acylation might not work.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the synthesis involving nitration, then acylation, then bromide.

But again, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making acylation difficult. So perhaps Friedel-Crafts isn't feasible. Unless the nitration is done in such a way that the acylation can still proceed.

Alternatively, maybe nitration is done after acylation and bromination.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acylation → bromination → nitration, as in option A.

So, after acylation, bromination puts Br at 3. Then nitration puts NO2 at 5 (meta to Br). That seems correct.

So, in that case, the steps in option A would be:

i) acylation → acetophenone.

ii) bromination → Br at 3.

iii) nitration → NO2 at 5.

But option A has more steps after iii. Let me look again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → FeCl or something else? Maybe a reduction.

Wait, but after nitration, do we need to do anything else? The target is already achieved after steps i, ii, iii.

So why are there more steps? Perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the nitration isn't the last step.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So after the nitration step, the substituents are in place. So why would there be further steps like iv, v, etc.?

Hmm, perhaps some of the steps are for protection or other functional group transformations. Alternatively, maybe the order isn't correctly represented in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration isn't done at the ring but on a side chain. But that doesn't seem to apply here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitration step in option A is performed in a way that adds another nitro group. But the target only has one nitro group. So that would be a problem.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is done after some reduction steps. Let me think about step iv in option A: Fe/HCl. Fe and HCl could be for reducing nitro groups to amines, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back. The correct synthesis steps should be:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Nitrate → NO2 at 5.

Which is exactly what option A does in steps i, ii, iii. The rest of the steps (iv to vii) are extra and may not be part of the correct sequence. So perhaps the correct option is A.

But why are the other steps present? Maybe the options include all steps, but only the first three are needed. Or perhaps the other steps are for some other purpose, but they don't affect the substituent positions.

Wait, maybe the question is about the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps some steps are involved in activating or deactivating the ring for the next substitution.

Wait, another thought: after acylation, the ring is less reactive, so nitration may not proceed unless the ring is activated. But wait, nitration is a strong reaction and can occur even with a less activated ring. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration needs to be done in a specific position.

Alternatively, maybe option B is correct.

Wait, in option B, the steps are: bromination first, then nitration, then acylation. But as I thought earlier, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, making acylation difficult.

So, perhaps option B isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the nitration step is done after the bromide is introduced, but in a way that the nitro group is added in the correct position relative to both substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3.

3. Brominate → Br at 5 (meta to nitro).

But then the substituents would be at 1 (COCH3), 3 (NO2), 5 (Br). Which is the same as the target.

So, let's see which option does that.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at meta → position 5.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But the ring is now substituted with Br (3) and nitro (5), both EWG, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So this option is invalid.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

iii) AcCl → acylation. But nitro is gone, replaced by amine. Benzene now has an NH2 group, which is activating. So acylation can proceed. Then bromination, etc.

But in that case, the substituents would be in different positions.

Wait, let me think. In option C:

i) nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → I think Fe/HCl is for the Rosenmund reduction (to reduce esters to aldehydes), but in this context, perhaps it's for something else. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is not a strong enough reducing agent for nitro groups. Nitro groups are typically reduced with H2/Pd or Sn/HCl. So perhaps this step is for something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The correct sequence is acylation → bromination → nitration, which is steps i, ii, iii in option A. That would give the substituents in the correct positions. So option A is the correct answer.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (ketone, bromine, and nitro group) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has a ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5, forming a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Acetylation of benzene using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ produces acetophenone (ketone at position 1).  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds a nitro group at position 5 (meta to bromine).  
   This sequence correctly places all substituents in the desired positions. The additional steps (iv–vii) in this option are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and do not affect the outcome.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination of benzene with Br₂/FeBr₃ produces bromobenzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds a nitro group at position 5 (meta to bromine).  
   - **Step iii**: Acetylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ attempts to introduce the ketone. However, the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation unlikely to proceed.  
   This sequence is invalid due to the inability to acetylate the deactivated ring.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration of benzene with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ produces nitrobenzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is likely intended for reduction, but it is not strong enough to reduce a nitro group.  
   - **Step iii**: Acetylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ would fail because the ring is deactivated by the nitro group.  
   This sequence is invalid due to the inability to acetylate the deactivated ring.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration of benzene with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ produces nitrobenzene.  
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is likely intended for reduction, but it is not strong enough to reduce a nitro group.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl and subsequent steps are unnecessary and do not align with the target molecule.  
   This sequence is invalid as it does not lead to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is provided in **Option A**, where acetylation, bromination, and nitration are performed in the correct order to yield the target molecule. The additional steps in Option A are extraneous but do not interfere with the synthesis.

**Answer: A**
