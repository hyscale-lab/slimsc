Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through the question and the options carefully. 

The question says that a chemist found an unnamed white solid and is trying to identify it using spectral data. The data given includes mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and 1H NMR. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D.

First, let's start by analyzing each piece of data one by one. 

Mass Spec: The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the highest mass peak. The 158 peak is a fragment, possibly due to some kind of adduct or isotopic peak? Wait, but molecular weight is 156. Let's calculate possible molecular formulas. If the molecular weight is 156, what's a possible formula? Let me think, 156 divided by 12 is about 13 carbons, but wait, that's a lot. Maybe something else. Let's think about the possible structures in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Then substituting with Cl (35.5) and another OH (-17, but wait, that's not correct. Let me compute each component. 

Benzaldehyde is C7H7O (wait, no, benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, which is C7H6O. So if we have 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, because the benzaldehyde has a CHO (which is O), and the hydroxy is another O, and Cl. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: 

C:7 *12=84; H:5*1=5; Cl:35.5; O:2*16=32. Sum: 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Oh, so the molecular weight is approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156 (m/z). So maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, which would have a molecular weight of 156.5, but the mass spec shows 156. So perhaps it's the M+ peak (like M+2 or something else). Wait, but the molecular ion is the highest, and the next peak is 158, which is 2 units higher. Hmm, maybe that's because of the presence of chlorine? Chlorine has an average atomic weight of about 35.5, so the M+2 peak for Cl-containing compounds is common. So, the molecular ion at 156 could be M+ (Cl is 35, but exact masses vary). Alternatively, sometimes the molecular ion could be the M+ (Cl as 35.5, but the exact mass might round to 156.5, but the mass spec detected it as 156. Maybe the exact mass isn't critical here. The presence of Cl would mean that the M+ and M+2 peaks are visible. But in this case, the 158 is at 32% intensity, which is a typical isotopic abundance for Cl. So the molecular formula likely includes Cl. 

So, moving on to IR data: A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, either from alcohols or carboxylic acids. The sharp peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1, but can be a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or an aldehyde. Wait, but an aldehyde's carbonyl is higher, around 2700-2800 (stretch) and the C=O around 1720. But the IR here has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which could be an O-H stretch. 

Wait, but wait, the broad peak from 3500-2700? That's a wide range. Hmm, perhaps it's not just a simple O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's a stretch for something else. Or perhaps the broad peak is due to an -OH group, maybe in a carboxylic acid. Because the -OH in a carboxylic acid is usually broad and around 2500-3300. Wait, but the region given is 3500-2700, which is a bit lower than the usual for O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde's O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, wait, maybe it's an alcohol. Because the O-H in an alcohol is usually a broad peak around 3300-3500. Or perhaps it's a phenolic O-H, which is also broad, but maybe around 3000-4000. Hmm. So, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but sometimes a bit higher. An ester's carbonyl is around 1730-1760. Alternatively, a ketone is around 1700. Wait, but 1720 is a bit higher than a ketone. So maybe it's an ester or a carboxylic acid. 

Looking at the NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). 

The 11 ppm singlet suggests an aldehyde proton, because aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR here, it's a singlet, so maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but another possibility is a phenolic OH, but in that case, the integration is 1H, but phenolic OHs are usually broad, not sharp. So in this case, the 11 ppm is a sharp singlet, which may not fit a phenolic OH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group with an adjacent proton, but I'm not sure. Let's think more about the NMR. 

The downfield region: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets, each integrating for two protons, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other, so the protons are next to substituents, and would be split into doublets. So the coupling would be between adjacent protons, leading to a doublet. So for example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, maybe with groups in the para positions. 

So, putting this together: The molecule has a benzene ring, with substituents in the para position. Let's think about the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to benzene at position 4, and a carboxylic acid group also at position 4 (since benzoic acid is at position 1, so 4-chloro would be on the opposite side). Wait, no, benzoic acid is at position 1, and 4-chloro would be at position 4, which is the para position. So the structure would have Cl and COOH in para positions. 

In the NMR of benzoic acid derivatives, the proton adjacent to the COOH group would be deshielded. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring protons would be two doublets, each integrating for two H. The protons next to the COOH group would be at higher ppm. Let me think about substituents on the benzene ring. For benzoic acid, the protons ortho to COOH are usually around 8.0-8.5 ppm, and the para proton (if any) would be around 7.5-8.0. But in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are Cl and COOH in para positions. So the ring would have two sets of protons: the two ortho to Cl, which might be downfield, and the two meta, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of coupling.

Alternatively, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite, so the protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each ortho to a substituent would be a doublet. 

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are Cl and COOH in the same ring. So the ring has three substituents: COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. Then the ring would have positions 2,3,5,6 with H. Wait, no, wait: if the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), then the ring would have H at positions 2,3,5,6. The H at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH (ortho), and H at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl (meta to COOH and para to Cl). 

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring substituents are Cl and COOH at para positions. So the ring would have two substituents, Cl and COOH, each in opposite positions. Let me imagine the structure: positions 1: COOH, position 4: Cl. So the ring positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. 

In such a structure, the H at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The H at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be less deshielded. So the NMR would have two doublets, one from the H ortho to COOH (probably higher ppm) and another from the H ortho to Cl (lower ppm). 

But looking at the NMR data: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So, the higher ppm (8.02) would correspond to the H ortho to COOH, and the lower (7.72) to H ortho to Cl. 

In the 1H NMR, we also have a peak at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a singlet. For a carboxylic acid, the OH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but here it's a singlet. That might not fit, because the OH in a carboxylic acid is usually broad due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. If it's an aldehyde, the proton would be around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But 11 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol. But phenols usually have broad peaks. 

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular weight would be C7H5ClO2, same as option A. So mass spec fits. 

IR: The broad peak from 3500-2700 suggests O-H (carboxylic acid, which has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300). The strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 would be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. 

In the NMR, the 11 ppm peak would be the -COOH proton, but why is it a singlet? Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad singlets, but this one is a sharp singlet. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. 

Alternatively, let's think about option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, no, chloroformate would be OCl-CO-Ph? Or is it O-CO-Cl attached to phenyl? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, the structure is OCOCl attached to the benzene ring. 

In that case, the NMR would have the aromatic protons, but what about the other signals? The chloroformate group has an ester-like structure. The carbonyl would be around 1720 cm^-1 (ester carbonyl), which matches the IR. The O-H stretch? Wait, phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an O-H group. So the IR would show the carbonyl, but where's the broad peak? Because the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which suggests O-H. So if option C is correct, that peak wouldn't make sense. So probably option C is not correct. 

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So in this case, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 2. The NMR would show different splitting. Let's think about the aromatic protons. If COOH is at position 1 and Cl at 2, then the ring would have H at positions 3,4,5,6. The H at position 3 would be adjacent to Cl (ortho), and H at position 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Wait, this might complicate the splitting. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. The H at position 3 would be adjacent to Cl, and H at position 6 would be adjacent to COOH. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about meta and para substituents. Alternatively, perhaps I should move to another option.

Option A:3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. The structure would have the aldehyde group at 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3. So the ring would have substituents at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). That leaves H at positions 4,5,6. The H at position 4 would be adjacent to Cl (position 3), and H at position 5 would be adjacent to OH (position 2). Hmm, the NMR would have multiple peaks, perhaps more than two doublets. But the NMR data given only shows two doublets, each integrating for two H. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are in a para pattern, which would suggest substituents in para positions, but in option A substituents are at 2 and 3, which are meta, so the ring protons would not form a para pattern. So the NMR for option A would not have two doublets integrating for two H each. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, let's go back to the NMR data. Two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So perhaps the substituents are para to each other. So for example, COOH and Cl in para positions, as in option B. 

But then, the 11 ppm peak in the NMR. If it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would be broad, but in the data, it's a singlet. So that's a problem. Alternatively, if the peak is not the OH, but something else. Let's think again about the NMR.

Another option: the 11 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. If the peak is a singlet, perhaps it's an aldehyde. Then, the structure would have an aldehyde group. Looking at the options, option A is a benzaldehyde derivative.

But in that case, the IR would show a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which could be the aldehyde's carbonyl. But aldehydes have a strong absorption around 2720 cm^-1 for the C-H stretch (the aldehyde's H). But in the IR data, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700, which could include the aldehyde's C-H stretch. Wait, but the aldehyde's C-H is typically a sharp peak around 2720 cm^-1, but it's possible that the IR data is combining multiple peaks. Hmm.

Alternatively, the 11 ppm peak could be the aldehyde. Then, the IR would also show the aldehyde's C=O at ~1720 cm^-1, which matches. But then, the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 would need to be explained. That's a wide range. Maybe it's the O-H from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, but if it's an aldehyde, there's no O-H. So that's a problem. 

Wait, but the IR data has a broad peak from 3500-2700. So that's a broad peak covering a large region. Could that be an O-H stretch? Like from a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's an aldehyde, there shouldn't be O-H. So perhaps that line of thought is incorrect. 

Maybe the 11 ppm peak is a carbonyl oxygen next to an electronegative group. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula C7H5ClO2. Mass spec: M+ at 156, and M+2 at 158 (32%), which fits Cl's isotopic pattern. IR: O-H from carboxylic acid (broad) and C=O (sharp at 1720). NMR: 

The aromatic protons would be two doublets as discussed. The 11 ppm peak would be the COOH proton. However, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, not a sharp singlet. But in the NMR data, it's a sharp singlet. Hmm, that's a problem. Could the NMR be recorded under conditions where the exchange is fast, making the peak sharp? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's not the COOH proton. 

Wait, another possibility: the 11 ppm peak is from an aldehyde. So let's say that the structure is a benzaldehyde with substituents. Looking at option A: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, the structure would have OH at position 2, CHO at position 1, and Cl at position 3. 

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Let me imagine the ring: positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the aromatic H would be at 4,5,6. So H4 is between Cl (3) and H5. H5 is between OH (2) and H4. H6 is between H5 and CHO (1). 

The NMR would show peaks from H4, H5, and H6. But looking at the data, the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So that suggests that the ring has two pairs of equivalent protons. So perhaps substituents are in para positions, such as COOH and Cl, as in option B. 

Alternatively, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would have COOH at 1, Cl at 2. The aromatic protons would be at 3,4,5,6. H3 is next to Cl, H4 is para to COOH, H5 is next to COOH, H6 is next to H5.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the NMR data again. 

The two doublets in the aromatic region suggest that the ring has two substituents in para positions, which each have two equivalent protons. So for example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 (meta) would not give two doublets integrating for two H each. So substituents must be in para positions. 

So considering all options, only options B and D have substituents in para positions. Let me see:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. These protons would be split into two sets of doublets. 

Protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be more deshielded, so higher ppm. Protons at 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be less deshielded, lower ppm. 

So in NMR, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) would be H2 and H6 (ortho to COOH), and 7.72 (d, 2H) would be H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl). 

So that fits the NMR data. 

What about the 11 ppm peak? If it's a COOH proton, but it's a sharp singlet, which is unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't a carboxylic acid but another compound with a carbonyl and an O-H. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring protons would be at 3,4,5,6. H3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2), H4 is para to COOH (position 1), H5 is adjacent to COOH (position 1), H6 is adjacent to H5. 

In that case, the aromatic protons would be split in a way that maybe gives more complex multiplets. For example, H3 would be next to Cl, so perhaps a triplet or doublet. But the NMR data shows two doublets of 2H each, which better fits para substitution. So option D might not fit as well. 

Wait, but let's think about the 1H NMR for 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The protons ortho to COOH (H3 and H5) would be more deshielded, appearing around 8.0 ppm, while the H4 and H6 (meta and para to substituents) would be around 7.5-7.8 ppm. But I'm not sure about the exact splitting. 

Another approach: looking at the molecular weight. The molecular ion is 156. Let's calculate for each option:

Option B: C7H5ClO2. 

C:7 *12=84; H:5=5; Cl=35.5; O:2*16=32. Total:84+5+35.5+32= 156.5. So M+ would be 156, M+2 (Cl) at 158.32% (since Cl has about 35% abundance for the M+2). The mass data fits.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same molecular formula as B, so mass spec would be the same. 

So both options B and D have same molecular formula. How to differentiate between them?

Looking at the NMR again. Let's think about the coupling constants in the aromatic region. 

In option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid), the H2 and H6 (ortho to COOH) would be adjacent to H3 and H5. Each of these would be doublets due to coupling with one adjacent proton. Similarly, H3 and H5 would couple with H2 and H6, leading to doublets. 

So in the NMR, two doublets, each integrating for two H. That matches the data. 

In option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), the substituents are at 1 and 2. The H3 and H5 would be ortho to Cl, so perhaps their shifts would be different. Also, the coupling between the protons might lead to more complex splitting. 

Alternatively, let's think about the chemical shifts. The H ortho to COOH (like H2 in option B) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. For benzoic acid derivatives, the H ortho to COOH are typically around 8.0-8.5 ppm. The data shows 8.02 and 7.72, which fits this pattern.

The 11 ppm peak in the NMR is a singlet. If it's a COOH proton, why is it a singlet? Alternatively, perhaps it's not COOH. Let me think again.

Wait, what about option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2 as well. So same as B and D.

IR: The carbonyl of an ester (1720 cm^-1) would fit. But where's the O-H? Phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an O-H. So the IR broad peak from 3500-2700 can't be explained. So option C is unlikely. 

So back to option B and D. 

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The aromatic protons would be two doublets. The COOH proton would be a broad peak around 12 ppm, but the NMR shows a sharp singlet at 11. Hmm.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. Let me imagine the NMR. COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 2.

The H3 is adjacent to Cl, and H5 is adjacent to COOH. H4 is para to COOH, and H6 is next to H5.

The H3 would be ortho to Cl, perhaps around 7.5 ppm, as a doublet. H5, ortho to COOH, around 8.0 ppm, as a doublet. H4 and H6 would be meta to substituents, maybe around 7.8 ppm. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, let's think about the coupling. For option D, the substituents are at 1 and 2. 

H3 is adjacent to Cl (position 2) and H4. So H3 would couple with H4, so it would be a doublet. H4 is adjacent to H3 and H5. So H4 would couple with both, leading to a triplet. H5 is adjacent to H4 and H6, and H6 is adjacent to H5 and H1 (which is COOH). So H5 could be a doublet or triplet. 

This would lead to more complex splitting than the two doublets observed. So perhaps option D is not correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in para positions, making the aromatic protons into two sets of doublets. That fits option B. 

So the NMR data fits option B. The only issue is the 11 ppm peak being a sharp singlet. But perhaps in some cases, the COOH proton can appear as a sharp singlet under certain conditions, maybe if it's exchange broadened but appears as a singlet due to fast exchange. Alternatively, maybe the 11 ppm peak is not the COOH proton. 

Wait, another thought: the 11 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton. If the molecule has both a COOH and an aldehyde group, but that's not the case in any of the options. Because looking at options, only option A has an aldehyde. 

Wait, option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Let me imagine the structure:

CHO (position 1), OH (2), Cl (3). The aromatic H would be 4,5,6.

H4 is adjacent to Cl (3), H5 is adjacent to OH (2), H6 is adjacent to CHO (1). 

The NMR would have signals for H4, H5, and H6. H4 and H6 would each be coupled to one proton (H5 and H4 respectively?), leading to doublets. H5 would be coupled to both H4 and H6, leading to a triplet. But the data shows two doublets, integrating for two H each. So option A's NMR wouldn't fit. 

So, back to option B. Maybe the 11 ppm peak is an impurity or some other group. But considering all the data, option B seems to fit better. 

So the IR has a broad O-H (carboxylic acid), a strong carbonyl at 1720. The NMR shows two doublets, which fit a para-substituted benzene, and a singlet at 11 ppm, which we're assuming is the COOH proton. 

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data: mass spectrometry (MS), IR spectroscopy, and 1H NMR. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and a fragment peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest a molecular formula of **C7H5ClO2** (molecular weight ~156.5), consistent with the presence of chlorine (Cl) and oxygen (O). The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data includes **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**, **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)**, and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring with two sets of equivalent protons.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains a benzaldehyde group, an OH group, and a Cl substituent. The aromatic protons would not form two doublets integrating for two protons each, as the substituents are not in para positions. Additionally, the 11 ppm peak in the NMR does not fit an aldehyde proton, which typically appears around 9-10 ppm. This option does not match the NMR data.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a Cl substituent in para positions on the benzene ring. The IR spectrum matches, as the broad peak corresponds to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data fits: the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the substituents, respectively. The singlet at 11 ppm likely corresponds to the deshielded COOH proton. This option aligns well with all the spectral data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-Ph). However, it lacks an O-H group, so the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ cannot be explained. Additionally, the 11 ppm peak in the NMR does not fit this structure. This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a Cl substituent in meta positions on the benzene ring. The NMR data shows two doublets, which are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. This option does not fit the observed NMR pattern, as the substituents are not in para positions. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR absorption, and 1H NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular formula matches the mass spectrometry data, the IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group, and the NMR data aligns with the para-substituted aromatic ring structure.

**Answer: B**
