Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the process γγ → e⁺e⁻. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, which is a billion electron volts. That's way higher energy than visible light or even X-rays.

Wait, so the gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons. I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon, like from the CMB, they can produce electron-positron pairs if there's enough energy. For that to happen, the center-of-mass energy must be at least twice the electron mass, since you're creating two particles.

The electrons have a rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV each, so two of them would need a combined energy of at least 1.022 MeV. So the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) for the two photons must be at least 1.022 MeV. 

But wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions because the CMB is isotropic. So I think for two photons with energies E1 and E2, the center-of-mass energy squared (s) is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. Let me think about the exact formula.

Oh right, for two photons moving in opposite directions, the energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 ) ) because the momenta are opposite. So that simplifies to sqrt(4 E1 E2). Because (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1-E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. So the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = 2 * sqrt(E1 E2).

Wait, let me check. Let me say photon 1 has energy E1 and photon 2 has E2. The momenta are in opposite directions, so their vectors are p1 = E1/(c) in one direction, p2 = E2/(c) in the opposite. So when you compute the invariant mass squared s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. E_total is E1 + E2. p_total is (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) if they're moving opposite. But wait, in the CMB rest frame, the average photon is moving isotropically, but for a single photon from the CMB, maybe it's moving towards the gamma-ray photon. Hmm, perhaps I should consider the scenario where the two photons are moving head-on.

Wait, but the CMB photons are isotropic, so on average, for any given gamma-ray photon, the CMB photon could be coming from any direction. But for the interaction γ + γ → e⁺e⁻, the process is most efficient when the photons are moving in opposite directions because that's when their combined energies are highest. So the cross-section peaks when the two photons are moving in opposite directions, so that's the dominant contribution.

So the maximum energy for the process to occur is when the two photons collide head-on. So for the minimum center-of-mass energy, which is the threshold, that's when sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c². So 2 m_e c² is about 1.022 MeV. So setting sqrt(s) equal to that, so 2 * sqrt(E1 E2) = 2 m_e c² → sqrt(E1 E2) = m_e c² → E1 E2 = (m_e c²)^2.

But wait, in this problem, E1 is the energy of the gamma-ray photon, and E2 is the energy of the CMB photon. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So E1 * E2 = (m_e c² )^2 → E1 = (m_e c² )^2 / E2.

Calculating that: m_e c² is 0.511 MeV. So (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2. E2 is 1e-3 eV. So E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) → let me compute that.

Wait, (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 = approx 0.261 * 1e12 (eV)^2. Then divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV. But wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. Because 1e9 eV = 1 GeV → 1e14 eV = 1e5 GeV.

Wait, let me check the math again: (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.511^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261 * 1e12 eV². So E1 = (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )= 0.261e15 eV. Which is 2.61e14 eV. Since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV. So E1 is approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6*1e5 GeV. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Is that correct? Because I'm using E1 * E2 = (m_e c^2)^2. So E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Yes, because when the two photons collide head-on, the condition for the process to happen is that their combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2 m_e c². So the minimal E1 is when the product E1 E2 is (m_e c^2)^2, so E1 is (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Wait, but wait. The problem states "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So the idea is that such high-energy gamma-rays would annihilate with CMB photons, reducing their number over time. The lifetime is determined by the probability of such annihilation. So the energy E is where this process becomes significant.

So the calculation leads us to E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) → 0.261e12 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV → 2.61e5 GeV.

So the answer is option C, 2.6e5 GeV.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Energy for Pair Production**: The center-of-mass energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the combined rest energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2 = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$.

2. **Center-of-Mass Energy Formula**: For two photons with energies $E_1$ (gamma-ray) and $E_2$ (CMB photon), moving head-on, the center-of-mass energy is given by:
   \[
   \sqrt{s} = 2\sqrt{E_1 E_2}.
   \]
   At the threshold, $\sqrt{s} = 2m_e c^2$, so:
   \[
   2\sqrt{E_1 E_2} = 2m_e c^2 \implies \sqrt{E_1 E_2} = m_e c^2 \implies E_1 E_2 = (m_e c^2)^2.
   \]

3. **Solving for $E_1$**: The energy of the CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $E_2$ and $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we solve for $E_1$:
   \[
   E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2} = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}}.
   \]
   - Compute $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2$.
   - Divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$: $E_1 = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}$.
   - Convert to GeV: $1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$, so $E_1 = 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.

4. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated energy $E_1 \approx 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ matches option C.

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ is **2.6 × 10⁵ GeV**.

So E1 * E2 = (m_e c² )^2 → E1 = (m_e c² )^2 / E2.

Calculating that: m_e c² is 0.511 MeV. So (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2. E2 is 1e-3 eV. So E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) → let me compute that.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV. But wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. Because 1e9 eV = 1 GeV → 1e14 eV = 1e5 GeV.

Wait, let me check the math again: (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.511^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261 * 1e12 eV². So E1 = (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )= 0.261e15 eV. Which is 2.61e14 eV. Since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV. So E1 is approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Energy for Pair Production**: The center-of-mass energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the combined rest energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2 = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$.

2. **Center-of-Mass Energy Formula**: For two photons with energies $E_1$ (gamma-ray) and $E_2$ (CMB photon), moving head-on, the center-of-mass energy is given by:
   \[
   \sqrt{s} = 2\sqrt{E_1 E_2}.
   \]
   At the threshold, $\sqrt{s} = 2m_e c^2$, so:
   \[
   2\sqrt{E_1 E_2} = 2m_e c^2 \implies \sqrt{E_1 E_2} = m_e c^2 \implies E_1 E_2 = (m_e c^2)^2.
   \]

3. **Solving for $E_1$**: The energy of the CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $E_2$ and $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we solve for $E_1$:
   \[
   E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2} = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}}.
   \]
   - Compute $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2$.
   - Divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$: $E_1 = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}$.
   - Convert to GeV: $1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$, so $E_1 = 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.

4. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated energy $E_1 \approx 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ matches option C.

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ is **2.6 × 10⁵ GeV**.
