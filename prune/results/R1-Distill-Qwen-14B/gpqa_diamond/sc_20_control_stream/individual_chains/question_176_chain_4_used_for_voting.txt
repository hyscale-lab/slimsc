Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, matrices usually have elements as scalars, but I think this is a vector in a three-dimensional space because the operators are 3x3 matrices. So the state vector has three components: -1, 2, 1. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length (the square root of the sum of squares of the components) is 1. Let me check that. So the sum is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Oh, wait, but that's not 1. Maybe the state isn't normalized, but I think when dealing with probabilities, we need to normalize it. Or perhaps the state is given as a vector, and we can proceed without normalization right away. Hmm, maybe I should come back to that.

The operators for P and Q are given. Let me note down the matrices for P and Q.

Operator P is a 3x3 matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q is another 3x3 matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring P and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the question says: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the sequence is first P, then Q. So we need the probability that when we measure P first, we get 0, and then when we measure Q, we get -1.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the first measurement of P will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, the measurement of Q is performed on this new state.

So the process is: measure P, get 0, which gives a new state (eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0). Then measure Q on this new state, and find the probability of getting -1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as the combined measurement, but I think the proper approach is to first find the eigenstates of P, project the initial state onto the eigenspace of P=0, and then from that state compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Let me break it down into steps.

Step 1: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

Because when we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P, and the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to that eigenvalue.

So first, find the eigenvalues of P.

The matrix for P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable. The eigenvalues should be real.

To find eigenvalues, we solve det(P - λI) =0.

So the matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]

[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

So determinant D = -λ * det(minor at (1,1)) - (1/sqrt(2)) * det(minor at (1,2)) + 0 * det(...).

Minor at (1,1) is the 2x2 matrix:

[-λ, 1/sqrt(2)]

[1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) )= λ² - (1/2).

Minor at (1,2) is the 2x2:

[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]

[0, -λ ]

Determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -λ / sqrt(2).

So D = (-λ) * [λ² - 1/2] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ -λ / sqrt(2) ) ] + 0.

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ)/2.

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ -λ / sqrt(2) ) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ / sqrt(2)) )= (λ)/(2).

So D = [ -λ³ + (λ)/2 ] + [ λ/2 ] = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

Set D =0: -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ (-λ² +1 )=0 → λ=0 or λ²=1 → λ= ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So when measuring P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the initial state is the vector (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute the norm. As I thought earlier, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2= 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6).

But in quantum mechanics, the state is a unit vector, but here the initial state is not normalized. So maybe we should normalize it first.

So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).

But when we calculate the probabilities, perhaps we can proceed without normalizing because the probabilities scale accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as a non-normalized vector, but the process of projection could involve normalization.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without worrying too much about the normalization, as we're dealing with projection probabilities, which are ratios.

But let's proceed.

The initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2,1). So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are eigenvalues 0,1,-1. The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the components of |ψ> projected onto each eigenvector.

Wait, no. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |ψ> with the corresponding eigenvector (normalized), right?

But wait, each eigenvector must be normalized. So for each eigenvalue, we need to find the corresponding eigenvectors, normalize them, then compute the projection.

So, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue of P.

Starting with λ=0.

Solving (P -0 I) |v> =0 → P|v>=0.

So the matrix P is:

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]

[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

We need to find vectors |v> = (x,y,z) such that P v =0.

So:

Equation 1: 0*x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0*z =0 → y=0.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2))x + 0*y + (1/sqrt(2)) z =0 → x + z =0 → x= -z.

Equation3: 0*x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0*z =0 → y=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 satisfy y=0, x = -z.

So |v> = (x, 0, x) where x can be any real number.

But we can choose x=1, then z=-1. So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the initial state is (-1,2,1). Let's compute the inner product with this eigenvector.

Inner product = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

But since probabilities are the square of the absolute value, the probability for P=0 is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = 2.

But wait, the initial state hasn't been normalized. Let me think. The initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1), with norm sqrt(6). So the inner product is [ (-1,2,1) ] . [ (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) ] = (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

The square of the magnitude is (sqrt(2))^2 =2. Since the initial state's norm squared is 6, the probability is 2/6 =1/3. Because when you compute the probability, you take the inner product squared divided by the norm squared of the state.

Wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the probability of obtaining a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and the normalized eigenvector. So if the state is not normalized, we need to compute it as | <eigenvector | ψ> |² / ||ψ>||².

Alternatively, perhaps we can normalize the initial state first.

Let me compute the normalized state.

The initial state vector is |ψ> = (-1, 2,1). The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is |ψ_n> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

The eigenvector for P=0 is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The inner product <v0 | ψ_n> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Calculating each term:

First term: (-1)/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1)/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = same as first term.

So total is (-1/(2 sqrt(3)) ) + (-1/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2=1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, that's the probability for P=0. Now, once P is measured to be 0, the state collapses into |v0>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, we need to measure Q on this new state.

So what are the eigenvalues of Q?

Looking at the matrix for Q:

[1 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 -1]

This is a diagonal matrix, so the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but when you have a diagonal matrix, the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, because each basis vector is an eigenvector with the corresponding diagonal element as the eigenvalue.

So:

Eigenvector for Q=1 is (1,0,0).

Eigenvector for Q=0 is any vector in the y-axis, but since the matrix is diagonal and the middle row is zero, all vectors with second component non-zero and others zero would be eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0. But for simplicity, let's say the eigenvector is (0,1,0), but wait, does that work?

Wait, the matrix Q is diagonal, so any vector along the y-axis (0, y, 0) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0 because Q acting on (0,y,0) would result in (0,0,0) = 0*(0,y,0).

So yes, the eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors.

So for Q=-1, eigenvector is (0,0,1).

Now, the state after measuring P=0 is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

We need to compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.

The eigenstates for Q are orthogonal and form a basis. So the state |v0> can be expressed in terms of these eigenstates.

Compute the components of |v0> in the Q eigenbasis.

Specifically, the probability of getting Q=-1 is | <q=-1 | v0 > |^2.

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is |q-1> = (0,0,1).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*0 + ( -1/sqrt(2)) *1 = -1/sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability is 1/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute that again.

The state |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is (0,0,1).

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 *0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) *1 = -1/sqrt(2). The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability is 1/2.

So now, the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is (probability of P=0) multiplied by (probability of Q=-1 given P=0).

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but let me check my steps again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the state after P=0, then compute the inner product with Q=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the combined process, but I think the approach is correct.

Wait, but the initial state is |ψ> = (-1,2,1), which is not a unit vector. So when we compute the probabilities, perhaps we should normalize it first.

Wait, the initial state's norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

The projection onto the P=0 eigenvector is <v0|ψ_n> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) - (1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so we have (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/3), so the probability for P=0 is 1/3.

After that, the state is |v0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, the state |v0> is a unit vector, since (1/sqrt(2))^2 +0 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2= 1/2 +1/2=1.

So when we measure Q, the probability of getting -1 is the square of the inner product of |v0> and |q-1>.

Which is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = (1/2).

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. So the answer would be option D) 1/6.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: perhaps we can compute the expectation value using the projectors, but I think my method is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the state after P=0 and find its components in the Q eigenbasis.

The state |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The Q eigenstates are |q1>=(1,0,0), |q0>=(0,1,0), |q-1>=(0,0,1).

The component of |v0> along |q-1> is the third component, which is -1/sqrt(2).

The square of the absolute value is 1/2.

So yes, the probability is 1/2 for Q=-1, given that P=0.

Thus, the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements: first measuring \( P \) and then \( Q \). The goal is to find the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in successive measurements.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is determined by solving \( P|v\rangle = 0 \). The eigenvector is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The initial state is given as \( |\psi\rangle = (-1, 2, 1) \), which is not normalized. Its norm is \( \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |\psi_n\rangle \) and \( |v_0\rangle \):

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_n \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \( Q = 1, 0, -1 \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

\[
|q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |v_0\rangle \) and \( |q_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
\langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Combined Probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

**Answer: D**
