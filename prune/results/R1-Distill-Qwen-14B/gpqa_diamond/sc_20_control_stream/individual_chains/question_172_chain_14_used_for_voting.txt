Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think about it step by step.

The problem says that iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Wait, so the excitation is higher in star 1. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's the energy difference ΔE between the two levels we're considering.

Since the photospheres are in LTE, I should use the Boltzmann distribution equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. But in this problem, since the question is about the ratio of excitation levels, I can probably assume that the statistical weights are the same or that their ratio is 1. Because the question states it's the same energy level being compared for both stars, right? Or wait, no, they're at the same energy level, but the excitation is different between the stars.

Wait, no, the problem says that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as in star 2. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, no: the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given, so perhaps each star's atoms have their own energy levels, but the same ΔE for both stars. Oh, but wait, no. The energy difference is given as the same for both stars because it's a specific energy level. So the ΔE is the same for both.

So for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is governed by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote n_i as the number in the excited state and n_j as the number in the lower state. So for star 1, n_i1 / n_j1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), assuming g_i = g_j. Because if they have the same statistical weight, then the ratio is just the exponential term.

Wait, but in this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms. So let me think: the number of excited atoms in star 1 (n_i1) is twice that in star 2 (n_i2). Wait, no, wait. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's the excitation per atom, but more likely it's the ratio of excited to ground state.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the excitation level is such that the population in the higher energy level is twice as much in star 1 compared to star 2. So perhaps n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). Or maybe it's n_i1 = 2 n_i2. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the excitation level refers to the ratio of excited to ground state. So for star 1, the ratio is twice that of star 2.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor gives the ratio between the number of atoms in two energy states. So for each star, the ratio is:

n_i / n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star 1, this ratio is [n_i1 / n_j1] = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2, [n_i2 / n_j2] = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, the excitation is twice as much in star 1 as in star 2. So maybe the ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2. So:

n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2)

Which would be:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Is that correct? Or perhaps, since the excitation is higher, the ratio is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy state. So if star 1 has higher excitation, the ratio n_i/n_j is higher for star 1 than for star 2.

So according to the problem statement, the ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1 ) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2 ) )

Hmm, okay. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1 ) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2 ) ) )

Simplify left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Which is: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me check that step. So:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

So [ΔE/(k)] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, that's because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation becomes:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but the question is about the equation for the effective temperatures T1 and T2. So we can write:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Hmm, but the options are in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE or k. That makes me think that perhaps the equation should not include the energy term, but the options have ln(2) equals some ratio. But the options don't have any terms with ΔE, so perhaps either I'm missing something, or perhaps the equation I'm deriving is part of a larger point.

Wait, but looking back, the question gives the ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. However, the options don’t involve ΔE, which makes me think that perhaps the equation I'm looking for is the one that relates ln(2) to the temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again. The problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So in star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j is twice as much as in star_2.

So star_1: ratio_1 = n_i1 / n_j1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

star_2: ratio_2 = n_i2 / n_j2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

According to the problem, ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2 )

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't include ΔE or k, so perhaps this is not the way. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the equation without the ΔE term. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can cancel ΔE. Let's see. Let me write it as:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] * [ ΔE/(k) ]

But again, the options don't have ΔE. So perhaps the equation I derived would lead to one of the options when ΔE/(k) is accounted for. But the problem gives us the value of ΔE, so perhaps the equation would involve that.

Wait, but the question is asking which equation for the effective temperatures is correct. The options A to D are expressions involving ln(2) and the temperatures. So perhaps the equation I derived is correct, but looking back, the options don't have any constants except ln(2).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. The question is about the excitation of iron atoms in a specific energy level. So the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower one is given by the Boltzmann equation.

So, for a two-level system, the ratio is:

n_2/n_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for star 1, the ratio is n1_2/n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2, the ratio is n2_2/n2_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that in star 1, the atoms are twice as excited, which I think means that (n1_2/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n2_1 )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

But the options don't involve ΔE, so perhaps the correct equation is expressed as ln(2) equals something involving the temperatures. So looking at the options, which one matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But our equation has [ΔE/(k)] multiplying that term. So unless [ΔE/(k)] is equal to 1, which I don't think it is, that's not the case. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the ratio of the excitation is (n_i1/n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2). So, for star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So the ratio is higher in star 1, meaning that T1 is lower than T2, because higher temperatures lead to more excitation. Wait, no, higher temperatures would lead to more excitation because the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms can overcome the energy barrier to be in the higher energy state.

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n_i/n_j increases. So higher T implies higher ratios. So if star 1 has a higher ratio (twice as much as star 2), then T1 must be higher than T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that star 1 has twice the excitation, so higher T. So in the equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which would imply that T1 is less than T2, because the exponential for T1 is smaller, meaning that -ΔE/(k T1) is smaller than -ΔE/(k T2), meaning T1 is larger than T2. Wait, no, because if T1 is larger, then ΔE/(k T1) is smaller, making the exponent more negative. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let's suppose T1 is larger than T2. Then:

ΔE/(k T1) is smaller than ΔE/(k T2) because T1 is bigger. So, -ΔE/(k T1) is less negative than -ΔE/(k T2). So exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller. So exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) would be larger than exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But in our case, exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), which would mean that T1 is lower than T2. Because if T1 is lower, ΔE/(k T1) is larger, so -ΔE/(k T1) is more negative, so the exponential is smaller. Wait, no, that's conflicting. Let me think.

Wait, let's take numbers. Suppose T1=5000 K, T2=4000 K.

ΔE/(k T1)= (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K *5000 K) ) = 1/(5000) ≈ 2e-4.

Similarly, ΔE/(k T2) = 1/(4000) ≈ 2.5e-4.

So, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ≈ exp(-2e-4) ≈ approximately 0.9998.

exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ≈ exp(-2.5e-4) ≈ approx 0.99975.

So, the ratio for T1 is 0.9998, for T2 it's 0.99975. So for T1=5000 K, the ratio is higher than T2=4000 K. So higher T leads to higher ratio. So in this case, if star_1 has higher excitation (higher ratio), then T1 would be higher than T2.

But in the equation, our setup is:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which would require that exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) is larger than exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), which would require that -ΔE/(k T1) > -ΔE/(k T2), which implies that (1/T1) > (1/T2), so T2 > T1. Wait, that can't be right because higher T leads to higher ratio.

Wait, no, wait. Let's take T1=3000 K, T2=4000 K.

ΔE/(k T1)= (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K *3000 K) )= 1/3000 ≈ 3.33e-4.

So, exp( -3.33e-4 ) ≈ ~0.999667.

For T2=4000 K, ΔE/(k T2)= 1/4000= 2.5e-4, so exp(-2.5e-4)≈ ~0.99975.

So, if T1 is 3000 K, the ratio would be ~0.999667, and for T2=4000 K, it's 0.99975. But that doesn't make sense, because higher T should give higher ratio (n_i/n_j). Wait, because when T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so -ΔE/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(-x) becomes larger. So higher T gives higher ratio.

So, in the equation, if exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), then that implies that exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) is larger than exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), which would imply that T1 < T2, because exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases when T decreases. So star_1 would have a higher ratio when T1 is lower than T2. But that contradicts the earlier expectation, so perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct setup is that the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, let's think of it as:

n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2 )

Which would mean:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So taking ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranged:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2 )

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

[ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

But in the options given, none of them have ΔE or k. So perhaps this indicates that I might have made a mistake in the initial setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the inverse, like the ratio of the populations is twice, but perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe the problem states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2. So, ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2.

But that's what I did earlier, leading to the equation above.

But the options don't involve any of the terms except ln(2) and T1, T2. So perhaps the correct equation is (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(ΔE).

But the options don't have any constants, so perhaps the correct option is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, looking at the equation I derived, the left side is ln(2), and the right side is [ΔE/(k)] * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So unless [ΔE/(k)] is 1, which it's not, option D can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation. Wait, the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute [ΔE/(k)].

k is the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So [ΔE/(k)] = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the same as k (1.38e-23 J/K). So [ΔE/(k)] = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels to the temperature. The ratio of excited to ground state populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star 1 and star 2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The problem provides \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \) into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
