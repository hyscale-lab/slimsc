Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. So from the perspective of the astronaut, time moves slower compared to someone back on Earth. But wait, the question is asking for the time from the astronaut's point of view, right?

The spacecraft is going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c. So I guess I need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t' is the proper time experienced by the astronaut, and t is the time measured in Earth's frame.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think. The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is the shortest time. So t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but t is the time as measured by someone on Earth. Wait, maybe I should calculate the time on Earth first and then find out how much the astronaut ages.

The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth is about 160,000 light-years, I think. Wait, wait, no, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So if the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time it takes from Earth's frame is distance divided by speed.

So let me compute that. Distance is 160,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So time t is (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 160,000 years. Because 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so dividing by that makes the time only a little longer than 160,000 years.

Wait, but that can’t be right. Wait, 160,000 light-years at nearly speed of light would take about 160,000 years, but from the astronaut's perspective, due to time dilation, they experience less time. So t' is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 is approximately (1 - 2*2.3e-7), but wait, let me calculate it more precisely. 0.99999987 squared is about 0.99999974. So 1 - 0.99999974 is 0.00000026. So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that. sqrt(2.6e-7) is about 5.1e-4. Because  (5.1e-4)^2 = approx 2.6e-7.

So the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 5.1e-4 ≈ 1960. So gamma is about 1960.

So the time experienced by the astronaut t' is t / gamma. Because t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The proper time t' is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the shortest. So in Earth's frame, the time is t, and the astronaut's time is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) which is the same as t divided by gamma.

So t (Earth time) is 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approx 160,000 years. Because 0.99999987 is about 1, so 160,000 divided by almost 1 is almost 160,000.

So t' would be 160,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.00051 ≈ let's compute that.

160,000 * 0.0005 is 80. 160,000 * 0.00001 is 1.6. So 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.00001, so 80 + 1.6 = 81.6 years.

Wait, so t' is approximately 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old. Adding 81.6 years would make them 103.6, but the aliens have a lifetime of 150 years. So they would live long enough, right? Because 22 + 81 is 103, which is way below 150.

But wait, the options don't include 81.6. Let's look at the options. Option D is 77, C is 81. So 81.6 is closest to 81, which is option C. But the question says "approximately" so maybe 81 is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years. But the problem says that the spacecraft is going to Earth, so maybe Earth is in the Large Magellanic Cloud? No, Earth is in the Milky Way. So the distance would be about 160,000 light-years as I thought.

Wait the question says "their destination is Earth", so the distance is 160,000 ly. So the calculation seems right.

So from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 81 years. So their age would be 22 + 81 = 103, which is well within their 150-year lifespan. So the answer would be 81 years, option C.

Wait, but another thing to consider is that from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So they would perceive the distance as shorter, which would reduce the time. Oh wait, right! So maybe I should compute it that way.

In the astronaut's frame, the distance is Lorentz-contracted. So the distance would be L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So L is 160,000 ly * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.000509 ≈ 81.44 light-years.

Then the time experienced by the astronaut is distance divided by speed: 81.44 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 81.44 / 1 ≈ 81.44 years. So about 81 years, which matches the previous calculation.

So the astronaut would be about 22 + 81 = 103 years old upon arrival. Since the average lifetime is 150, they would survive. So the correct answer would be 81 years, option C.

So looking at the options:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth. No, because 103 is less than 150.

B) 72 years: Doesn't match our calculation.

C) 81 years: Correct.

D)77 years: Close to our calculation but a bit off.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and Lorentz contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years.

### Step 1: Time dilation formula
The proper time (\( t' \)) experienced by the astronaut is related to the time (\( t \)) measured in Earth's frame by the formula:
\[
t' = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]
where \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.99999974} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}
\]

### Step 2: Time in Earth's frame
The time \( t \) for the journey in Earth's frame is:
\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Proper time experienced by the astronaut
Using the time dilation formula:
\[
t' = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Alternative approach using Lorentz contraction
From the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted:
\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.44 \, \text{light-years}
\]
The time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
t' = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{81.44 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 81.44 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since their lifespan is 150 years, they will survive the trip. Among the options, the closest approximation is **81 years**.

The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth is about 160,000 light-years, I think. Wait, wait, no, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So if the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time it takes from Earth's frame is distance divided by speed.

So let me compute that. Distance is 160,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So time t is (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 160,000 years. Because 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so dividing by that makes the time only a little longer than 160,000 years.

So v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 is approximately (1 - 2*2.3e-7), but wait, let me calculate it more precisely. 0.99999987 squared is about 0.99999974. So 1 - 0.99999974 is 0.00000026. So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that. sqrt(2.6e-7) is about 5.1e-4. Because  (5.1e-4)^2 = approx 2.6e-7.

So the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / 5.1e-4 ≈ 1960. So gamma is about 1960.

So the time experienced by the astronaut t' is t / gamma. Because t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The proper time t' is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the shortest. So in Earth's frame, the time is t, and the astronaut's time is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) which is the same as t divided by gamma.

So t (Earth time) is 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approx 160,000 years. Because 0.99999987 is about 1, so 160,000 divided by almost 1 is almost 160,000.

So t' would be 160,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.00051 ≈ let's compute that.

160,000 * 0.0005 is 80. 160,000 * 0.00001 is 1.6. So 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.00001, so 80 + 1.6 = 81.6 years.

Wait, so t' is approximately 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old. Adding 81.6 years would make them 103.6, but the aliens have a lifetime of 150 years. So they would live long enough, right? Because 22 + 81 is 103, which is way below 150.

But wait, the options don't include 81.6. Let's look at the options. Option D is 77, C is 81. So 81.6 is closest to 81, which is option C. But the question says "approximately" so maybe 81 is the correct answer.

Then the time experienced by the astronaut is distance divided by speed: 81.44 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 81.44 / 1 ≈ 81.44 years. So about 81 years, which matches the previous calculation.

So the astronaut would be about 22 + 81 = 103 years old upon arrival. Since the average lifetime is 150, they would survive. So the correct answer would be 81 years, option C.
