Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves reacting a specific epoxide with an organocuprate reagent, and then determining the product. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically open epoxides in a specific way.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let me visualize its structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it has two rings. The oxabicyclo part indicates that one of the bridgehead carbons is an oxygen (epoxide ring). So the structure probably has a three-membered ring (epoxide) attached to a bicyclic structure. I'm trying to draw this mentally. The numbering is 1,3,4,6, so the substituents are on those carbons.

The reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is an organocuprate. I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates (like in the ring-opening reactions), the nucleophile (which in this case is the methyl group from the cuprate) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Also, for disubstituted epoxides (like when both carbons are connected to other substituents), the attack occurs with inversion of configuration because of the SN2-like mechanism.

Wait, but wait. The question mentioned that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. So when the nucleophilic attack happens, the configuration (R/S) of that carbon flips.

Let me think about the structure. The molecule is a bicyclo compound with substituents at 1,3,4,6. Oh wait, the 7-oxabicyclo suggests that the oxygen is at position 7? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, in the bicyclo system, the oxabicyclo would mean that two of the bridge positions are connected via an oxygen. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating that part. Maybe the epoxide is part of the bicyclic structure, making it a three-membered ring with two adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, the epoxide is a three-membered ring where two carbons are connected by an oxygen. So in the bicyclo structure, the two carbons that are part of the epoxide are the bridgeheads. So, perhaps the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6? Or maybe 3 and 4? Or some other positions. Maybe I should sketch this out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the structure as a norbornane-like structure with an oxygen bridge. Norbornene has a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, but this is bicyclo[4.1.0], which would be different. Let me count the carbons. The full name is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, so it's a 7-membered bicyclic structure with an oxygen as a bridge. So the bicyclo is four, one, zero. That means the bridge structure has two bridges: one bridge with four carbons, another with one carbon, and another (the third bridge) that's zero? Or perhaps the rings are 4 and 1 in their bridge sizes. Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclo with two rings: one has 4 carbons and the other 1, connected by a bridge. So the structure is more like a bicyclo where one ring is a four-membered and the other is a one-membered, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would mean that the molecule has two rings: one with four members (including the bridgehead) and another with one member (a bridge), making the other bridge a single bridge. Hmmm. I might not need to get too bogged down in the exact structure, but perhaps focus on the fact that it's a disubstituted epoxide and the site where the cuprate will attack.

Wait, the main thing is that when the organocuprate attacks the epoxide, the methyl group (from Me2CuLi) will add to the less hindered carbon. Also, since the epoxide is disubstituted, the attack at the less substituted carbon (but wait, maybe it's more about the structure of the bicyclo system). Hmm.

But perhaps the key is to determine which carbon of the epoxide is more substituted. Since it's a bicyclo structure, each bridgehead is connected to other carbons. So, one carbon of the epoxide might be more substituted (more bulky groups around it) than the other. The reagent (Me2CuLi) will add the methyl group to the less hindered carbon.

Wait, but the question says that in disubstituted epoxides, the nucleophile adds to the less hindered carbon, and there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the Nu adds.

So, the original epoxide has two carbons connected by the oxygen. Let me imagine the bicyclo structure: perhaps the two bridgeheads are the epoxide carbons. One bridgehead is more substituted than the other. The more substituted bridgehead is probably the one that's more hindered, so the methyl group will add to the less substituted (less hindered) one.

But how do the configurations (R and S) come into play? The product will have a new stereocenter where the methyl adds, and inversion happens there, plus the existing stereocenters will influence the configuration.

Wait, the starting material is 1R,3R,4R,6S. Let me think about the positions. The epoxide is at 7-oxa, so perhaps the oxygen is between carbons 6 and 1? Or 3 and 4? Let me think: the molecule is 1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So, positions 1,3,4 have methyl groups. The 7-oxa indicates that the oxygen is at position 7, which would be part of the epoxide bridge. So the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 7? Or 7 and another position? Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the epoxide connects carbons 1 and 6 or 3 and 7?

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6. Because in bicyclo systems, the numbering starts at a bridgehead, then proceeds around the bridge. So, perhaps the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6, and the other substituents are at 3 and 4.

So the structure would be a bicyclo where the epoxide is between 1 and 6. So, the two carbons in the epoxide are 1 and 6. Let's imagine that.

So, the starting molecule has substituents at 1,3,4,6. So, the epoxide is between 1 and 6, both of which have methyl groups (since 1 and 6 are R and S in configuration, respectively, but wait, wait. The starting molecule is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo... So, 1 has a methyl, 3 has a methyl, 4 has a methyl, and 6 has a methyl. Wait, that's four methyl groups? But the product options have 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl or 1,2,4,5, etc. So perhaps the bicyclo structure leads to a ring-opening that forms a cyclohexanol derivative.

Wait, when the epoxide ring opens, the molecule becomes a diol. But wait, no—cuprates are organometallic nucleophiles. They don't just add water. They actually perform a conjugate addition. Wait, no, in epoxide ring opening, the cuprate would attack the less hindered carbon, breaking the epoxide ring and forming an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the epoxide by the organocuprate. The cuprate (Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon, the oxygen becomes an alkoxide, and then the workup (probably with an acid) gives the alcohol.

So, the product would have a new methyl group added to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, and the configuration at that carbon would invert.

But I need to consider the starting configuration and how the attack affects the structure.

First, I need to determine which carbon of the epoxide is less hindered. Since the molecule is bicyclo, each bridgehead (1 and 6) might be connected to other substituents. Let me think: in the starting structure, 1 is R, 6 is S, and 3 and 4 are both R. If the epoxide is between 1 and 6, then both those carbons have substituents: 1 has a methyl, and 6 has a methyl as well. So, the epoxide is between two bridgehead carbons, each carrying a methyl group. But perhaps one is more substituted than the other.

Wait, perhaps the bicyclo structure makes one bridgehead more substituted than the other. For example, bridgehead 1 might be part of a larger bridge, making it more substituted than 6. So, the less substituted would be 6. So, the methyl group would add to 6, the less hindered carbon.

But wait, 6 is S configuration. When the methyl adds to it, with inversion, what would the new configuration look like?

Alternatively, perhaps the other way around. Maybe the cuprate attacks the less substituted carbon. So, identifying which of the two epoxide carbons is more substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead 1 is more substituted, so the less substituted is 6. So the methyl group would add to 6.

But let's think about the product. The options are all cyclohexanols, so the ring-opening must have relaxed the ring into a cyclohexanol structure.

Wait, perhaps the bicyclo opens into a cyclohexane ring. So, the product is a cyclohexanol derivative with substituents.

So, when the epoxide is opened by the cuprate, the methyl adds to one of the former epoxide carbons, and the ring expands from bicyclo to cyclohexane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think step by step.

Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material.

The starting molecule is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

Looking up the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane structure, it's similar to norbornane but with a different bridge. Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two bridges: a four-membered bridge and a one-membered bridge, which doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, bicyclo[m.n.p] means the molecule has three bridges, with m, n, p being the number of carbons in each bridge. So, for bicyclo[4.1.0], it has three bridges: one with 4 carbons, another with 1, and another with 0? That can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers represent the number of rings? Or perhaps each number represents the bridge lengths. Wait, perhaps it's bicyclo with two bridge lengths: m and n, and the third bridge is implied by the sum of m and n being the total number of carbons minus 2. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think that each bridge is the number of atoms in that bridge. So, for bicyclo[4.1.0], it's a system where there are three bridges: one bridge with four atoms, one bridge with one atom, and another with zero? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a bicyclic structure with two rings, where one ring has four members and the other has one. Wait, no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a structure where the bridges are four carbons, one carbon, and the other bridge is the remaining. Wait, perhaps it's a norbornane-like structure but with different bridge lengths. Maybe it's a bridged bicyclic system where one bridge is four carbons and another is one, connected by a single bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as a bicyclo system where the two rings are a four-membered and a one-membered, which doesn't seem possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a molecule where two of the bridgeheads are connected via an oxygen in a three-membered epoxide ring. So, the structure would have a four-membered ring, a one-membered bridge (which is just a single carbon?), and the epoxide as the oxygen connecting two bridgeheads. Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen is part of a bridge, making it a three-membered epoxide ring.

Wait, maybe the epoxide is part of the bridge. So, the structure has two rings: one is a four-membered ring, another is a one-membered ring (which is just a bridge), and the third is a three-membered epoxide ring.

This is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I should think about the product instead. The product options are all cyclohexanols, so the reaction must open the bicyclo structure into a cyclohexane ring.

When an organocuprate opens an epoxide, the less hindered carbon is attacked. In a disubstituted epoxide, the nucleophile adds to the less substituted carbon with inversion of configuration.

So, let's say that in the starting material, the two carbons of the epoxide (let's call them A and B) have different substituents. Carbon A has more substituents (more hindered) and carbon B has fewer (less hindered). The cuprate's methyl group will attack carbon B.

But wait, in this case, both epoxide carbons are bridgeheads, so they might each have two or three substituents. Let's imagine that carbon A is more substituted than B. So, the methyl adds to B.

Now, the initial configuration at B is S (since in the starting material, 6 is S). When the nucleophile attacks B, which is an SN2-like process, the configuration inverts.

So, the attack would change the configuration from S to R (if B was S before).

But wait, the product is a cyclohexanol, so the oxygen becomes an alcohol group. So after opening, the structure becomes a cyclohexane with an OH group and a methyl group added.

Wait, but the starting material has three methyl groups: 1,3,4- trimethyl. The product options have four methyl groups because the cuprate adds another methyl. So, that makes sense.

So, the product will have four methyl groups: the three from the starting material plus the methyl from the cuprate.

So, the starting material has methyl groups on carbons 1,3,4,6. Wait, no, the starting material is 1R,3R,4R,6S. So, the methyl groups are on 1,3,4, and 6? No, wait, the name is 1,3,4-trimethyl. So, that's three methyl groups, on 1,3,4. The 6 has a substituent, which is the epoxide oxygen.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's try again.

The starting material is 1R,3R,4R,6S-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo... So the substituents are methyl groups on 1,3,4, and the 6 is a bridgehead with a substituent, which is the oxygen in the epoxide.

So, when the cuprate attacks, it adds a methyl group to one of the epoxide carbons (either 1 or 6, perhaps), inverting its configuration.

So, the product will have four substituents: the original three methyl groups (on 1,3,4) and the new methyl from the cuprate attack.

Wait, no. The starting material has 1,3,4-trimethyl, but the 6 is another bridgehead. So, the methyl groups are on 1,3,4, and another group on 6 (the epoxide oxygen). So, when the methyl adds to, say, position 6, which is S, the configuration there will invert to R.

Now, the product structure is a cyclohexanol. So, after ring-opening, the molecule becomes a cyclohexane ring with substituents.

Let me think about the configuration changes. The original substituents at 1,3,4 are R, R, R. The 6 is S.

After the attack, the methyl adds to 6 (if that's the less hindered), and the configuration inverts to R. So, in the product, 6 becomes R.

Wait, but in the product options, the substituents are on positions 1,2,4,5. So perhaps the numbering changes upon ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps after the ring opens, the numbering shifts, so the substituents that were in positions 1 and 6 now become adjacent positions in the cyclohexane ring.

This is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can approach it by considering the transition of the bicyclo structure to a cyclohexane structure upon attack.

The starting bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide (oxygen) would have the bridgehead carbons as 1 and 6. When the cuprate attacks, the epoxide opens, adding a methyl group to either 1 or 6, and the ring expands into a cyclohexane.

In the product, the substituents would be on the adjacent carbons. Let's say the methyl adds to carbon 6, which was the S configuration, so it becomes R. The other substituents (from 1,3,4) will be in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl adds to position 1, which is R, and after inversion becomes S.

Wait, but the question says that the methyl is always introduced at the less hindered. So, we need to figure out which of the two epoxide carbons is less hindered.

If bridgehead 1 is part of a larger bridge, it's more substituted, so the less hindered is bridgehead 6. So, the methyl adds to 6, which is S, inverting to R.

Now, during the ring-opening, the molecule would form a cyclohexane with substituents on adjacent positions.

But I'm not sure exactly how the substituents are arranged. Let me think about the product options.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the product has four methyl groups and an -OH group.

Wait, the starting material had three methyl groups and the 6S. After adding a methyl, the product has four. The -OH comes from the epoxide oxygen.

Wait, the starting material's 7-oxa is the epoxide. After opening, the oxygen becomes an -OH group attached to the cyclohexane.

So, the product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.

Now, which positions do these methyl groups occupy?

The starting material's 1,3,4 are methyl groups, and 6 would get another methyl from the cuprate attack.

But upon ring-opening, the positions might shift. So, perhaps 1 becomes position 1 in the cyclohexane, 3 and 4 become position 2 and 5, and 6 becomes position 6, but perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering shifts in the product. Let me think: in the bicyclo structure, the bridgehead 1 is connected to bridgehead 6 via the epoxide. When the cuprate adds to 6, the ring opens, and the substituents that were on 1,3,4, and 6 now appear in certain positions on the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps when the ring opens, the substituents that were on 1 and 6 (the epoxide carbons) become adjacent in the cyclohexane. So, the methyl added to 6 becomes adjacent to the original substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead 1 is connected to 6 via a three-membered epoxide. So, opening would connect those two carbons in the cyclohexane.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry.

The starting material has 6 as S. The methyl adds to 6, inverting its configuration to R.

So, in the product, the substituent that was at 6 (now with a methyl) is R configuration.

Now, looking at the product options, the positions of the substituents need to match.

Wait, the product options have substituents on positions 1,2,4,5. So, maybe the starting substituents 1,3,4,6 become positions 1,2,4,5 in the product.

If the starting substituents 1,3,4,6 are arranged in a way that when the ring opens, 3 becomes 2, 4 becomes 5, and 6 becomes something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to imagine the bicyclo structure as:

Imagine a norbornane-like structure, but with different bridge sizes. The epoxide is between bridgeheads 1 and 6. So, when the cuprate attacks, the ring opens, and the substituents arrange themselves in a cyclohexane.

If the methyl adds to 6 (the less hindered), then in the cyclohexane, the substituents (methyl from 6) would be adjacent to the substituent from 1.

In the product, the substituents would be on positions 1, 2, 4,5. So, perhaps the original 1 (R) becomes 1 in the product, 3 (R) becomes 2, 4 (R) becomes 5, and 6 (after adding methyl and inversion becomes R) becomes position 4?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to approach it differently.

The starting molecule is a bicyclo structure with methyl groups on 1,3,4, and an epoxide on 1 and 6. Upon reaction with Me2CuLi, the methyl adds to the less hindered epoxide carbon (let's say 6), inverting its configuration.

So, in the product, the substituents would be on 1,3,4, and 6 (with the added methyl), but when the ring opens, the numbering may change, leading the substituents to be on positions 1,2,4,5 in the product's cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps when the epoxide opens, the molecule becomes a cyclohexane with substituents on 1,2,4, and 5.

So, the new methyl is on 2, for example. Let's see the options.

Looking at option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. So, substituents on 1,2,4,5.

But that would mean the methyl groups are on 1,2,4,5. So, perhaps the original 1,3,4,6 become 1,2,5,4? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's 1 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2, and 4 becomes 5 in the product. So, the 6 would become 4? Or maybe 6 becomes 6.

Wait, maybe I should sketch this mentally. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide between 1 and 6. Upon ring-opening, the ring expands. So, the epoxide carbons (1 and 6) are now attached to each other in the cyclohexane.

So, the product would have a six-membered ring where 1 and 6 are adjacent. So, the substituents from 1,3,4,6 would be on 1,2,4,5 in the cyclohexane.

Wait, let's see: the starting molecule's substituents are on 1,3,4,6. After ring-opening, the substituents that were on 1 and 6 are now adjacent in the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the substituent that was on 6 (now with a methyl) is on position 2, and the substituent from 1 is on position 1. The substituent from 3 (R) would be on position 5, and 4 (R) on position 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent from 3 (R) becomes position 2, and 4 (R) becomes position 5, while 1 remains position 1, and 6 becomes position 6.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

This means that in the product, the cyclohexane has methyl groups on 1,2,4,5. The hydroxyl is on 1.

Wait, but the starting material's 1 is R, and after attack, perhaps it becomes R or S. Hmm.

Alternatively, after the methyl adds to 6, which is S, it becomes R. So, the substituents at 6 (now with methyl) would be R.

Looking at option B: substituents at 1,2,4,5 are all R. So, let's see:

The original 1 was R, 3 R, 4 R, 6 S.

After adding methyl to 6 (becomes R), in the product, the substituents would be:

1 R, 2 (from 3) R, 4 R, 5 (from 4) R, and the new methyl at 6 (now R). But in the product, 6 becomes a different position.

Wait, perhaps in the product, the substituents are arranged as:

- 1: R (from original 1)
- 2: R (from original 3)
- 4: R (from original 4)
- 5: R (from original 6 after methyl addition)
- and 2 has another methyl (from original 3? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.)

Alternatively, perhaps the product's substituents are as follows:

If the original 1,3,4,6 are now in positions 1, 2, 5, and 6 in the product cyclohexane, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's substituents are on 1,2,4,5. So, the starting substituents are at 1 (R), 3 (R), 4 (R), and 6 (S). Let's say the methyl adds to 6 (S) leading to R configuration. So in the product, 6 becomes position 2? That would make 2 as R.

So, substituents:

1: R,

2: R (from 6, now R),

4: R (from 4),

5: R (from 3).

But the product options don't all have four R's. Let me check.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

So, substituents at 1,2,4,5 are all R. Then, in the product, all four substituents have R configuration.

But wait, the starting 6 was S, but after inversion, it's R. So, the substituent from 6 is now R.

So, if in the product, the substituents are:

- 1: R,

- 2: R,

- 4: R,

- 5: R,

then the product would have four R's. Which matches option B.

But wait, option B has substituents at 1,2,4,5. Let me see:

If the original 1 is R and becomes 1 in the product, original 3 (R) becomes 2 in the product, original 4 (R) becomes 5, and original 6 (after adding methyl and inversion) becomes 4 in the product.

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product's substituents are at 1,2,4,5, each R.

Assuming that's the case, and the product is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the ring-opening mechanism. The organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon, leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which upon protonation gives the alcohol.

In this case, the attack at the less hindered carbon (6) results in inversion of configuration. So, the original S at 6 becomes R.

Looking at the options, option B has 1R,4R,5R, and 2R. So, the product would have four R's.

Wait, but the starting material's 6 was S. After attack, the configuration becomes R. So, the substituent at 6 (now in the product as position 2?) is R.

If the product has substituents 1R, 2R, 4R,5R, that's option C.

Wait, option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Wait, that's four substituents on positions 1,2,4,5, all R.

So, if the starting material's 6 becomes position 2, and its configuration inverts from S to R, then the substituent at position 2 is R. The original 1 is R, 3 is R,4 is R.

In the product, 3's substituent would be at position 5, perhaps. So, that's R as well.

So, all four substituents in the product are R.

Looking at the options, option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. Wait, that's substituents on 1,2,4,5, but with 2 having two methyl groups? Because 2,2,4,5 implies that position 2 has two methyl groups. But the starting material only adds one methyl from the cuprate.

Wait, no. The starting material had three methyl groups, and the product has four. So, the product should have four substituents, each with one methyl. So, options with 2,2,4,5 would imply that two methyl groups are on position 2, which doesn't make sense unless two substituents are added there.

Wait, perhaps the product has four substituents, each with one methyl, so 1,2,4,5.

Looking back, option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

That's four methyl groups on 1,2,4,5. That makes sense because the starting material had 1,3,4,6, and the cuprate adds to 6, making it 1,3,4,6, and the product’s positions 1,2,4,5. So, perhaps 3 becomes 2, 6 becomes 5, and 4 remains 4.

But I'm getting stuck again. Another approach: in the product, the configuration at the site of attack (original 6) is inverted. So, if the starting 6 is S, the product's substituent at that position is R.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl. So, two methyls at 2. That doesn't fit, because only one methyl is added by the cuprate.

Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl. So, each has one methyl. That fits.

The stereocenters would be 1,2,4,5. So, all R.

So, the starting 1 (R) becomes 1 (R), 3 (R) becomes 2 (R), 4 (R) becomes 4 (R), and 6 (S, becomes R) becomes 5 (R) ?

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps after ring-opening, the substituents in the product are 1,2,4,5, each R.

So, the correct option would be option C, which is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

But wait, option B has 2,2,4,5. So, four substituents, but two on position 2. That's only possible if two substituents were added there, but the cuprate adds only one. So, option B is likely incorrect.

So, between option B and C.

If in the product, all four substituents are R, then option C is the correct one.

Wait, but the product's substituents are 1,2,4,5, and all are R. So, that would be option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the configurations again.

Starting material:

1: R,

3: R,

4: R,

6: S.

After attack, 6 (S) becomes R.

In the product, the substituents are:

1: R,

2: R (from 3),

4: R,

5: R (from 6, now R after inversion).

Thus, all four substituents are R, making option C correct.

Wait, but option C is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Yes, that seems to fit. So the answer should be option B? No, wait, option C is the one with all R's.

Wait, option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethyl... which doesn't have R for position 2.

Wait, no. Option C has all four substituents as R.

So, the correct product should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me₂CuLi, an organocuprate reagent. Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles that attack the less hindered carbon of an epoxide ring, leading to inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. The reaction results in the opening of the epoxide ring, forming a cyclohexanol derivative.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The starting material is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system with an epoxide ring (7-oxa). The substituents are:
   - Methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4.  
   - A bridgehead at position 6 with an oxygen atom (epoxide).  
   The stereochemistry is specified as (1R,3R,4R,6S).

2. **Reaction with Me₂CuLi**:  
   - The organocuprate reagent adds a methyl group to the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.  
   - The two carbons of the epoxide are bridgeheads (positions 1 and 6). Position 6 is less hindered compared to position 1, so the methyl group adds to position 6.  
   - The attack proceeds via an SN2-like mechanism, leading to **inversion of configuration** at position 6. Thus, position 6 changes from S to R.

3. **Product Formation**:  
   - The epoxide ring opens, and the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane structure expands into a cyclohexane ring.  
   - The substituents from the starting material (1, 3, 4, and 6) are reorganized into the cyclohexane framework.  
   - The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5, and an -OH group at position 1.

4. **Stereochemistry of the Product**:  
   - The original substituents at positions 1, 3, and 4 retain their R configuration.  
   - Position 6, after inversion, becomes R.  
   - In the product, the substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all R, resulting in the stereochemistry (1R,2R,4R,5R).

5. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect, as it does not match the expected stereochemistry or substituent positions.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect, as it suggests two methyl groups at position 2, which is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism.  
   - **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the expected substituent positions (1, 2, 4, 5) and stereochemistry (1R,2R,4R,5R).  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as it suggests a mixture of R and S configurations at position 2, which is inconsistent with the inversion at position 6.

### Conclusion:
The product of the reaction is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, corresponding to **Option C**.
