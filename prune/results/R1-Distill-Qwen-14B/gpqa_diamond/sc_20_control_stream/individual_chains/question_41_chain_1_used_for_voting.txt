Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember something about how the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light in it?

Wait, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, is that when the light is moving through a medium? Or is that only in a vacuum? Because in a medium, the speed is less than c, right? Like in glass, it's c/n.

So maybe the motion of the glass affects the observed speed. But how? Because the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but then the medium itself is moving. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formulas apply when you have velocities in different frames. But wait, in this case, the light is moving through a medium that's moving. So perhaps the speed of the light in the lab frame is different?

Let me think. The speed of light in the glass is u = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame, what speed do we observe for the light?

Wait, but if the medium is moving, does that affect the velocity of the light? Hmm. Maybe I need to think using the frame of the glass first. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame. So I can use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed as observed in the lab.

The formula is: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c^2)) 

But wait, this is when the motion is along the same direction. Since u is the speed of light in the glass (which is c/n, but wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is u = c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the glass, the observed speed would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2)).

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards them. The light is moving through the glass at u = c/n in the glass's frame. So from the lab, the light's speed would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but what's the direction? The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So when the glass moves towards the observer, the light is moving towards the observer as well, but perhaps faster?

Wait, no. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, then their velocities add in a certain way.

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, so the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well, same direction.

But let me think again, the setup: the light beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer. So both the glass and the light are moving in the same direction, toward the observer.

So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light, inside the glass, is moving at speed u = c/n relative to the glass. So in the lab frame, what is the speed of the light?

Using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c^2)).

But u is c/n, which is less than c. Let's plug that in.

u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = (c + n v) / (n (1 + v/(n c)) )

Wait, no, let's compute numerator and denominator correctly.

Wait, numerator: (c/n + v) = (v + c/n) = (n v + c) / n.

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c².

Which is 1 + (v (c) )/(n c² ) ) = 1 + v/(n c).

So denominator is [n c + v ] / (n c) ?

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

Denominator: 1 + (u v)/(c²) = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v)/(n c).

So the denominator is (n c + v)/(n c) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute this more carefully.

Denominator: 1 + (u v)/(c²) = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c^2 = 1 + v/(n c).

So denominator is [n c + v ] / (n c) ?

Wait, 1 is equal to (n c)/(n c), so adding v/(n c) gives (n c + v) / (n c).

So denominator is (n c + v)/(n c).

Now, the entire expression is:

u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

This becomes [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify:

(c + n v) * n c / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels, leaving (c +n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Because in the numerator, (c + n v) multiplied by n c, and the denominator is n (n c + v). 

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-express all that.

So u' = [ (c/n + v) ) ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Which is [ (v + c/n) ] / [ 1 + (v/(n c)) ]

Let me factor out 1/n from the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (v + c/n ) = (n v + c ) / n.

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c ) = (n c + v ) / (n c )

So u' = [ (n v + c)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is [ (n v + c)/n ] * [ (n c)/(n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator of the first fraction cancels with the n in the numerator of the second fraction.

So we have (n v + c) * c / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (n v + c ) → Wait, no, the numerator is (n v + c ) multiplied by c, which is c(n v + c).

Denominator: (n c + v )

So u' = [ c (n v + c) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but that's the same as [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but I'm trying to see if this can be simplified further. Let's factor the denominator: n c + v = v + n c.

Wait, the numerator is c (c + n v ). So the expression is:

[c (c + n v)] / (n c + v )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out a v from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let's see. The denominator n c + v = v + n c. The numerator is c (c +n v ) = c (n v + c )

Wait, perhaps we can factor out c from the denominator: n c + v = c (n) ) + v. Hmm, that doesn't seem to help.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can factor out a v from the numerator. Let me think:

c (n v + c ) =c * [ v n + c ] = v n c + c².

Denominator: n c + v.

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification. Let's see what the options look like.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 1. That would imply the light speed is c, but that's only the case in a vacuum when the medium is stationary. Here, the medium is moving, and the light is in the medium, so speed should be less than c. So option B is unlikely.

Option A: (1 +n v )/(n +v )

Wait, but if I factor c from numerator and denominator:

u' = [c (n v + c ) ] / (n c + v )

Divide numerator and denominator by c:

= [c (n v + c ) ] / (n c + v ) = [ c (n v + c ) ] / (n c + v )

If I factor c in the denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v → Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, but if I divide numerator and denominator by c, I get:

[ (n v + c ) ] / ( (n c + v ) / c )

Which is [n v + c ] / (n + v/c )

Wait, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using Galilean addition, not relativistic? But that can't be right because when velocities are significant compared to c, Galilean doesn't apply.

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is 1, so c=1. Let me try that. So c=1.

Then, u is the speed of light in glass, which is 1/n.

The velocity addition formula becomes:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v )

Because when c=1, the denominator becomes 1 + u v.

So u = 1/n.

So u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate fractions:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v)

Which is option A.

Wait, so that's the speed of light in the lab frame.

Wait, but earlier when I used c=1, the same approach. So the correct answer would be option A?

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express it.

With c=1, u = 1/n. Glass moving at v.

u' = (u + v ) / (1 + u v )

So substituting u=1/n, that's ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is option A. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but earlier when I had c in the equations, I ended up with a different expression, but perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, when I set c=1, then c=1 in all terms. So the earlier substitution gives u' = (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which is exactly option A.

So the speed is (1 + n v )/(n + v )

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \( n \) is the refractive index of the medium. In this problem, the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

To simplify further, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

This is the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Now, let \( c = 1 \) (as stated in the problem), so the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:

- **Option B (\( 1 \))**: This would imply the speed of light is always \( c \), which is incorrect when light propagates through a medium.
- **Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \))**: This has the wrong sign in the denominator, which does not match the correct relativistic addition formula.
- **Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \))**: This incorrectly subtracts \( n v \) in the numerator, which is not consistent with the problem setup.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

But u is c/n, which is less than c. Let's plug that in.

u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = (c + n v) / (n (1 + v/(n c)) )

Wait, no, let's compute numerator and denominator correctly.

Wait, numerator: (c/n + v) = (v + c/n) = (n v + c) / n.

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c².

Which is 1 + (v (c) )/(n c² ) ) = 1 + v/(n c).

So denominator is [n c + v ] / (n c) ?

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

Denominator: 1 + (u v)/(c²) = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v)/(n c).

So the denominator is (n c + v)/(n c) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute this more carefully.

Denominator: 1 + (u v)/(c²) = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c^2 = 1 + v/(n c).

So denominator is [n c + v ] / (n c) ?

Wait, 1 is equal to (n c)/(n c), so adding v/(n c) gives (n c + v) / (n c).

So denominator is (n c + v)/(n c).

Now, the entire expression is:

u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

This becomes [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify:

(c + n v) * n c / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels, leaving (c +n v) * c / (n c + v )

So u' = [ (c/n + v) ) ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Which is [ (v + c/n) ] / [ 1 + (v/(n c)) ]

Let me factor out 1/n from the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (v + c/n ) = (n v + c ) / n.

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c ) = (n c + v ) / (n c )

So u' = [ (n v + c)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is [ (n v + c)/n ] * [ (n c)/(n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator of the first fraction cancels with the n in the numerator of the second fraction.

So we have (n v + c) * c / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (n v + c ) → Wait, no, the numerator is (n v + c ) multiplied by c, which is c(n v + c).

Denominator: (n c + v )

So u' = [ c (n v + c) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but that's the same as [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, perhaps we can factor out c from the denominator: n c + v = c (n) ) + v. Hmm, that doesn't seem to help.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can factor out a v from the numerator. Let me think:

c (n v + c ) =c * [ v n + c ] = v n c + c².

Wait, but if I factor c from numerator and denominator:

u' = [c (n v + c ) ] / (n c + v )

= [c (n v + c ) ] / (n c + v ) = [ c (n v + c ) ] / (n c + v )

If I factor c in the denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v → Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, but if I divide numerator and denominator by c, I get:

[ (n v + c ) ] / ( (n c + v ) / c )

Then, u is the speed of light in glass, which is 1/n.

The velocity addition formula becomes:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v )

Because when c=1, the denominator becomes 1 + u v.

So u = 1/n.

So u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate fractions:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v)

Which is option A.

Wait, so that's the speed of light in the lab frame.

Wait, but earlier when I used c=1, the same approach. So the correct answer would be option A?

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express it.

u' = (u + v ) / (1 + u v )

So substituting u=1/n, that's ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is option A. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, when I set c=1, then c=1 in all terms. So the earlier substitution gives u' = (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which is exactly option A.

So the speed is (1 + n v )/(n + v )

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \( n \) is the refractive index of the medium. In this problem, the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass itself, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

To simplify further, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

This is the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Now, let \( c = 1 \) (as stated in the problem), so the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:

- **Option B (\( 1 \))**: This would imply the speed of light is always \( c \), which is incorrect when light propagates through a medium.
- **Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \))**: This has the wrong sign in the denominator, which does not match the correct relativistic addition formula.
- **Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \))**: This incorrectly subtracts \( n v \) in the numerator, which is not consistent with the problem setup.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
