Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I need to use special relativity principles instead of classical mechanics.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, so I'll have to compute both values and match them.

First, let me tackle the relative speed. I think in special relativity, the relative speed isn't simply the difference between their velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity is more complicated. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, but which one is u and which is v here? Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 equals approximately 0.142857c. Rounding that, maybe 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that's a clue.

Now, for the total energy of the system. I think each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc squared. But wait, the masses are 2m and 3m, so I need to calculate each of their energies and add them together.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Energy of astronaut 1: E1 = gamma1 * mass1 * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Similarly, for astronaut 2 (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Energy of astronaut 2: E2 = gamma2 * mass2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c². Let me compute that: 1.1547 *3 is about 3.4641, so E2 ≈3.4641 mc².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D's E is 5 mc². So the total energy must be around 5.96, which points to option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation for E2. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(3/4) which is sqrt(4/3) ≈1.1547. So 1.1547 multiplied by 3 is 3.4641. So E2 is about 3.4641 mc². Oh, right, and E1 is 2.5 mc². So yeah, adding them together gives roughly 5.964 mc², which is 5.96 mc² when rounded. So option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the relative speed. So astronaut A is at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So the relative speed of A from B's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). That's (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c /0.7 ≈0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So yeah, that's correct.

So putting it all together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is the one that matches both.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A moves at \( u = 0.6c \) and astronaut B moves at \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 = 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), which matches options C and D.
- The total energy is \( 5.96mc^2 \), which matches option C.

Thus, the correct answer is:
