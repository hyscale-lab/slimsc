Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV, and the interaction Lagrangian is provided. I remember that in particle physics, the allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. The boson X couples to fermions with some coupling strength λ. So the decay products of X must be fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction is with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, when X decays, it will produce a pair of particles whose combined rest mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. For each fermion pair, the total mass (since they're produced as a pair) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

I need to list all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. Let's think about the possible fermions and their masses.

First, the fermions are quarks and leptons. The known fermions and their approximate masses (in GeV) are:

- Up quark (u): ~0.2 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.5 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV (so about 0.1 GeV)
Wait, wait, no: I think the strange quark is heavier. Let me think again. Wait, up and down are light, around 2-5 MeV. Strange is about 100 MeV. Then, charm (c) is about 1.5 GeV, bottom (b) is around 4.5 GeV, top (t) is about 173 GeV. But since X is 6 GeV, top is way too heavy—can't decay into t tbar because 2 * 173 GeV is way more than 6.

Leptons: electron (e) ~0.0005 GeV. Muon (μ) ~0.1 GeV, tau (τ) ~1.77 GeV. Neutrinos are almost massless, but they're not considered here since the problem doesn't mention them.

So for each fermion pair, the sum is 2*m_fermion. So I can calculate 2* each fermion's mass and see if it's less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's list the possible fermions and their masses:

- e: 0.0005 GeV, so 2e: 0.001 GeV → allowed.
- μ: ~0.1 GeV, 2μ: 0.2 → allowed.
- τ: ~1.77 GeV, 2τ: ~3.54 GeV → allowed.
- u: ~0.2 GeV, 2u: 0.4 → allowed.
- d: ~0.5 GeV, 2d: 1 → allowed.
- s: ~100 MeV → 0.1 GeV, 2s: 0.2 → allowed.
- c: ~1.5 GeV, 2c: 3 → allowed.
- b: ~4.5 GeV, 2b: 9 → which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar because 9 GeV >6 GeV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, X has mass 6 GeV. So for a fermion pair, the sum must be less than or equal to X's mass. So for each possible pair:

Check each possible pair:

e+ e-: 2 * 0.0005 ~0.001 → allowed.

mu+ mu-: 0.2 → allowed.

tau+ tau-: ~3.54 → allowed.

u ubar: 0.4 → allowed.

d dbar: 1 → allowed.

s sbar: 0.2 → allowed.

c cbar: 3 → allowed.

b bbar: 9 → not allowed.

t tbar: 346 GeV → way too big.

So the possible decay products are: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Wait, but what about charm? c is ~1.5 GeV. 2c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

But wait, what about bottom? X is 6 GeV. 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6, so no. So b is out.

So possible decays: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. Wait, but b is too heavy. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Hmm, that includes c cbar. So that's 3 GeV. Allowed, as 3 <6. So possible. So option B has all these except b and t.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau, mu, e. Wait, t tbar is 346 GeV. No, that's way too big. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is 9 GeV. So option D can't be right.

Wait, so the correct decay channels should include c cbar, but not b or t.

Looking at the options, option B includes c cbar, and excludes b and t. So option B includes c, which is allowed.

Wait, but the options may vary. Let me look again.

The options are:

A) Includes b, which is not allowed.

B) Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed except b and t.

C) Includes t, which is not allowed.

D) Includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct kinematically allowed decays are the ones in option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The interaction term is given. It's -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. That implies that X couples to fermions f. So what are the possible fermions f here?

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is ψ_f X ψ_f, which is a Yukawa coupling. So X couples to each fermion species f.

Therefore, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair for which the mass is allowed.

But the question is about the possible decay modes, regardless of whether the coupling exists. Wait, no, the coupling is given, so X can decay into any fermion species that it couples to and for which the mass is allowed.

Wait, but the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the boson X couples to all the fermions ψ_f, which would typically mean all the fermions in the Standard Model, unless specified otherwise.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as ψ_f, so f is a generic index. So X can decay into any fermion that is light enough.

So in that case, the possible decay products are all the fermion pairs where 2 m_f ≤6 GeV.

So let me recalculate.

Compute 2 m_f for each possible fermion:

e: 0.001 → allowed.

mu: 0.2 → allowed.

tau: 3.54 → allowed.

u: 0.4 → allowed.

d: 1 → allowed.

s: 0.2 → allowed.

c: 3 → allowed.

b:9 → not allowed.

t: 346 → no.

So the possible decay pairs are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the allowed decays are X → e+e-, mu+mu-, tau+tau-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Looking at the options again.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all allowed.

Option C includes t, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The boson \( X \) couples to fermions via a Yukawa interaction, and its decays are constrained by the requirement that the combined rest mass of the decay products must not exceed 6 GeV.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f\bar{f} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must be satisfied, where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \).

2. **Fermion Masses**: The approximate masses of Standard Model fermions are:
   - \( e \) (electron): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \sim 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \mu \) (muon): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \sim 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \tau \) (tau): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( u \) (up quark): \( \sim 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \sim 0.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( d \) (down quark): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \sim 1.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( s \) (strange quark): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \sim 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( c \) (charm quark): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \sim 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( b \) (bottom quark): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \sim 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - \( t \) (top quark): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

3. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the mass constraints, the allowed decay channels of \( X \) are:
   - \( X \rightarrow e^+e^- \),
   - \( X \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^- \),
   - \( X \rightarrow \tau^+\tau^- \),
   - \( X \rightarrow u\bar{u} \),
   - \( X \rightarrow d\bar{d} \),
   - \( X \rightarrow s\bar{s} \),
   - \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c} \).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels of \( X \) at the lowest order, excluding the forbidden \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \) decays.

**Answer: B**
