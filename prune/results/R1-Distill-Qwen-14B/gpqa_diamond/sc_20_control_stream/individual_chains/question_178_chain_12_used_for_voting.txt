Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about the Lagrangian given: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember are the gamma matrices in the Dirac equation context. The question is asking for the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, right. So I need to find the mass dimension of κ and then determine if the theory is renormalizable. Let me think about each part step by step.

First, mass dimension. I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the Lagrangian density has units of mass^4 (since it's integrated over four spacetime dimensions to give a dimensionless action). So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

So the term L_int is κ multiplied by some other terms. Let me write down the term: ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I need to find the mass dimension of each component here. 

I know that the Dirac field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the fields must have dimensions that make each term in the kinetic term of the Dirac equation (like i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ) have dimension 4. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension 3/2 because i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ would then be (3/2 + 1) = 5/2, wait wait, no, wait:

Wait, the kinetic term is like ∫ d^4x ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The term inside the integral must have dimension 4. So ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ should have dimension 4.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ) would also be 3/2. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So putting it together: 3/2 (ψ̄) + 1 (from ∂_μ) + 3/2 (ψ) = 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 4. So yes, that's correct.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since γ matrices are dimensionless (they are just matrices), the commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless.

What about F^{mu nu}? That's the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. So F^{mu nu} is ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu plus some terms with the gauge fields (but in Maxwell theory, it's just derivatives). Each derivative has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. Because in Maxwell theory, the term like F^2 in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. F is made from ∂A, so F has dimension 1 (because ∂ is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1). So F^{mu nu} has dimension 1.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term is like ∂_mu A_nu ∂^mu A^nu, which has to have dimension 4. Each derivative is 1, each A is 1. So each term ∂A would have dimension 1+1=2, but since it's (∂A)^2, that would be (2) * 2 = 4, which is correct. So F^{mu nu} is made from ∂A, so it has dimension 1.

So putting it all together in the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me compute the dimension of each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.
σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless.
ψ is 3/2.
F^{mu nu} is 1.

So multiplying them all: 3/2 (ψ̄) * (dimensionless) * 3/2 (ψ) * 1 (F) = (3/2 * 3/2) * 1 = 9/4.

Wait, but wait, these are four fields? No, the term is ψψF. So the product is ψ̄ ψ F, which is (3/2 + 3/2 + 1) = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 1 makes 4. Wait, no, that can't be right because each field has its own dimension. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

Each ψ term is a spinor, so ψ̄ ψ is a scalar, and thus has dimension (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. Then multiplied by F^{mu nu}, which has dimension 1, gives 3 +1=4. So the entire term without κ is dimension 4.

Wait, but that's the term without κ. So the term is κ multiplied by the rest. So the term in the Lagrangian is κ * (ψ̄ σ F ψ) [I think I have to consider the order here correctly. Oh wait, the term is ψ̄ σ F ψ? Or is it ψ̄ σ ψ F? Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Wait, but σ_{mu nu} is a tensor, and F^{mu nu} is another tensor. So the contraction over mu and nu would give a scalar. So the product ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu} would be a scalar, and its dimension is (ψ̄) (σ) (ψ) (F).

Since σ is dimensionless, and F is 1, and each ψ is 3/2, the product would be 3/2 +3/2 + 1 = 4. So the entire term, without κ, has dimension 4. So when we include κ, the term in the Lagrangian is κ times a dimension 4 quantity. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Therefore, κ must have dimension 0? Because 0 +4 =4. But wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no. Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is L = κ (ψ̄ σ F ψ), but the dimension of L must be 4. The term (ψ̄ σ F ψ) has dimension 4, as I computed. So κ must have dimension 0 (since 4 + [κ] =4 → [κ]=0). But wait, that can't be right because the options given don't have κ of dimension 0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dimensions. Let me try again.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each component's dimension step by step.

ψ̄: 3/2.

σ_{mu nu} is made from [gamma matrices], which are dimensionless (since they are matrices, not fields). So σ has dimension 0.

ψ: 3/2.

F^{mu nu}: dimension 1.

So the term ψ̄ σ ψ F is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 1 = 3/2 *2 =3 plus 1 is 4. So the term is dimension 4, and when multiplied by κ, the Lagrangian term has dimension [κ] +4 =4 → [κ] must be 0.

Wait, but none of the options have [κ]=0. The options are all -1 or 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the dimension of F.

Wait, F^{mu nu} is ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu. Each ∂ has dimension 1. So each term is ∂ (which is 1) times A (1), so F is dimension 2. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the Maxwell term (like F^2) have dimension 4, which is correct.

Wait, wait, Maxwell's Lagrangian is (F_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}) /4 which is dimension 4. So F itself must have dimension 1, because (F)^2 has dimension 4 → F is 2, since (F^2) would be 2*2=4. No, wait, no. Wait, in the term F_{mu nu} F^{mu nu}, each F has dimension 1, so the product is 2, but then the term is multiplied by some constants, but the overall term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of field dimensions.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for field dimensions. For a gauge field A_mu in 4D, the dimension is 1. Because the field strength F has dimension 2. Wait, because the term (F)^2 would have dimension 4, so F has dimension 2. Because F^2 (each F is 2) → 2 *2=4. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Maxwell Lagrangian is L = -1/4 F^{mu nu} F_{mu nu}. Each F is dimension 2 because when you compute F^2, you get dimension 4. So F has dimension 2. Therefore, F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

So going back to the term in the given Lagrangian: ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each part:

ψ̄ → 3/2.

σ_{mu nu} → 0.

ψ → 3/2.

F^{mu nu} → 2.

So the product is (3/2)(3/2)(2) = (9/4)*(2) = 9/2.

Wait, but wait, the term is ψ̄ σ F ψ, so that's 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = (3/2 *2) =3 +2=5. So the product is dimension 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term with κ must have dimension 4 → [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah, that makes sense now. So κ has mass dimension -1.

So the first part of the question, the mass dimension of κ is -1. So looking at the options, A and C have this.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. If the dimension is positive, then the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling would have to be multiplied by a term with higher dimension, leading to an infinite number of counterterms. Wait, no, the opposite: if the coupling has dimension positive, the interaction term is relevant, making the theory renormalizable. If the dimension is negative, the coupling is irrelevant, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. Remember that in 4 dimensions, a renormalizable interaction requires that the coupling constant have a mass dimension ≥0. Because when you have a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the dimension of g must be ≥0 for the interaction to be renormalizable. If the dimension is negative, the term is non-renormalizable because you can't absorb the divergences into a finite number of parameters.

Wait, in four dimensions, the dimension of the coupling in a theory with field φ (each φ has dimension (d-2)/2 where d is the spacetime dimension. So in 4d, φ has dimension (4-2)/2=1. So for a term g φ^k, the dimension of g is [g] = d - k * [φ]. So [g] =4 - k *1. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] ≥0 → 4 - k ≥0 →k ≤4.

In our case, the interaction term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let me see what operator this is. It looks like a four-fermion interaction, but wait, no: ψ̄ ψ is a scalar, and F is a field. Wait, but wait, the term F is the field strength tensor, which in 4d has dimension 2. So the term here is ψ̄ σ F ψ → which is a four-fermion interaction? Or is it a three-fermion and F? No, because F is a tensor, but in this term, it's being contracted with mu and nu indices from σ and F. So the interaction is between four fermions? Or is it a fermion-antifermion pair interacting with the field F (which is a gauge field)? Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ F ψ. So that's two fermions and a field F. Hmm, but F is a derivative of A, so perhaps this is a three-point vertex? No, wait, in the term ψ̄ σ F ψ, the F^{mu nu} is a field, so the term is ψ̄ σ F ψ → which is a four-fermion interaction? No, because ψ̄ is a spinor, ψ is a spinor, but F is a tensor. So it's a three-fermion interaction? No, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the overall dimension of the term to find out the dimension of the coupling. Because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term κ (ψ̄ σ F ψ) must have dimension 4. So we found that [κ] is -1.

Now, for renormalizability, we can use the power counting. In four dimensions, a term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension ≤4 to be renormalizable. Because if the term has dimension higher than 4, it would require an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The dimension of the term in the Lagrangian is 4 because that's the requirement. So the coupling must be such that when multiplied by the fields, it results in dimension 4.

In our case, the term is dimension 4 because [κ] is -1 and the product ψ̄ σ F ψ has dimension 4 +1 =5? Wait, no, earlier I thought the product without κ is dimension 5, so with κ being -1, the whole term is dimension 4. So the term is dimension 4.

Wait, but when considering renormalizability, each term in the Lagrangian must have a dimension ≤4. Because when you have loops and you renormalize, higher dimension terms would lead to more divergences.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Another way: in 4D, a term with dimension 4 is renormalizable, anything higher is not.

Wait, the term here is dimension 4, so the interaction is renormalizable. But wait, no—because the coupling has a negative dimension. How does that relate?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the scaling dimension. In a renormalizable theory, the coupling constant has a dimension that is non-negative. Because if the coupling has a negative dimension, then when you increase the energy scale, the coupling grows, which can lead to non-perturbative effects and makes the theory non-renormalizable.

So in our case, [κ] =-1, which is negative. Hence, the coupling is dimensionful with negative dimension. Therefore, the theory would not be renormalizable because the interaction term would be of higher dimension than 4, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, but wait. The term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So it's allowed in a renormalizable theory. But perhaps I'm missing something. No, wait, the coupling's dimension is negative. For a term like L = g Φ^4, where [g] =4 -4*(dimension of Φ). In our case, the term is L = κ (ψ̄ σ F ψ), and [κ]=-1, which would imply that the term is of higher dimension than 4? No, because when we calculated earlier, the product without κ was 5, and κ brings it down to 4.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the general formula. In 4D, each field has a certain dimension, and the dimension of the coupling is determined so that the term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4.

In a term like g ψ̄ ψ, the dimension would be [g] =4 - (3/2 +3/2) =4-3=1. So [g]=1, which is positive, hence the theory is renormalizable.

In a term like g ψ̄ ψ A, [A] is 1 (as in QED vertex), then [g] =4 - (3/2 +3/2 +1) )=4-4=0. So [g]=0, which is allowed for renormalizable.

In our problem, the term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. We found [κ]=-1. So the coupling has negative dimension. That would imply that the term is of higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but the term itself is dimension 4, which is allowed. So why is the coupling's dimension negative? Maybe because the interaction is higher order.

Wait, perhaps the number of fields in the term determines whether it's renormalizable. For example, a term with four fields (like four fermions) in 4D would require the coupling to have positive dimension to keep the term dimension 4.

Wait, but in our case, the term has two ψ fields, and an F which is two A fields (since F is made from ∂A). So perhaps this term is of higher order. Let me think: F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which is two derivatives acting on A, so F has two A fields and two derivatives.

But in the term, we have ψ̄ σ F ψ. So the term involves two ψ, and F, which involves two A's. So the term is ψ̄ σ F ψ → which is like ψ A^2 ψ. So it's a four-fermion interaction (since two ψ and two A's, but wait, A's are gauge fields, but in this term, the F is a field that's built from A, but this term is effectively a four-fermion interaction? Or is it a three-fermion interaction with an F?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Feynman diagrams. The vertex would involve two fermion lines (since ψ̄ and ψ) and the F would be a photon or gluon line. Wait, but F is a field, not a propagator. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the superficial degree of divergence for loops. The superficial degree of divergence in a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4L - (I *1), where L is the number of loops and I is the number of propagators. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in four dimensions, the renormalizability is determined by the dimension of the coupling. For a term in the Lagrangian, if the coupling has dimension [g] ≥0, the term is renormalizable. If [g] <0, the term is non-renormalizable.

In our case, [κ]=-1 <0 → the term is non-renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So now, putting it together. The mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable → no, because theory is not.

B) [κ]=1, ren → no.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren → yes.

D) [κ]=1, not ren → no.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In four spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore also have mass dimension 4. Breaking it down:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of $\gamma$-matrices and is dimensionless.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$, the field strength tensor, has mass dimension 1.

The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ thus has mass dimension:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 1 = 4.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must also have mass dimension 4, $\kappa$ must have mass dimension $-1$ to ensure the entire term remains dimensionless:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 4 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants in the Lagrangian have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the interaction terms do not require an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher order in the mass scale, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
