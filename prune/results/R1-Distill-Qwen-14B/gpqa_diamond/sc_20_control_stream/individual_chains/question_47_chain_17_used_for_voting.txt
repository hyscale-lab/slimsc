Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, I remember that the molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. Let me think about what functional groups are present here. The formula has 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. 

Looking at the IR data first. The strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches. Amide or amine groups usually show up in that region. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carbonyls in amides are typically around 1650-1750, so that could fit. Maybe it's an ester or an amide. Wait, but the presence of N-H in IR might point more towards an amide, but esters don't have N-H.

Now the NMR. Let's go through the peaks one by one. 

First peak: 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet with 3H suggests it's the end of a CH2CH3 group, so maybe connected to another CH2.

Next, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad could mean exchange, maybe an amide N-H, but wait, the integration is 2H. Alternatively, if it's an OCH2 group attached to something else. OCH2 might give a peak around 4 ppm, but why would it be broad? Maybe if it's adjacent to an electronegative group or if it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. Another thought: maybe it's the ethyl group's CH2 connected to another group, but that's more likely to be a triplet around 1.2.

Then, 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H – that's another CH2 group. The quartet suggests splitting from two neighboring groups, which usually happens when there are two neighboring protons. Wait, but if it's a quartet, maybe it's adjacent to a CH3. Like in an ethyl group, but earlier there was a triplet. Let me think: ethyl groups in esters or ethers. For example, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet and the CH3 as a triplet.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets each with 2H indicate two sets of protons, possibly in a para-substituted benzene, like two substituents opposite each other. For example, an OCH2CH3 group and another group on the benzene ring.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule is an ethyl ester of a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group, but wait, the NMR doesn't show a broad peak for NH2. The IR shows N-H, but if it's an amide, the NH would be around 3300-3500, which matches the IR given. But the NMR of benzamide would have more complex NH signals, but here the peak at 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe it's an N-alkyl group?

Wait, option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). The IR would have an amide N-H, which matches. The formamide group would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. In NMR, the ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm (since the CH3 would be triplet at 1.2). But wait, the NMR in the question has a quartet at 4.5 (2H) and a triplet at 1.2 (3H). So that could fit the ethoxy group. But where's the formamide's NH? The formamide has an NH, but it's a singlet as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit because formamide's NH would be around 8-9 ppm maybe. Wait, no. Wait, formamide's NH is typically around 8-9, but according to the NMR given, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0. So maybe that's not the case.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to NH-C6H4. Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH2-C6H4. Or wait, is it propionyl attached to the amino group? Maybe. Let me think. The propionate would be the ester group. Wait, but in this case, the amine might be a primary amine. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 (2H), maybe the ethyl group from propionic acid. Or perhaps it's the CH2 next to the ester oxygen. Hmm, but the quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2 suggests an ethyl group attached via oxygen, like an ethyl ester.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to a benzene ring with an amino group in the para position. So the benzene has -OEt and -NH2 groups in para positions. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the formula for D. Benzoate would be C7H5O2. Then the ethyl group is C2H5, so 7+2 =9 carbons. Hydrogens: benzoate is 5 H (from benzene), ethyl is 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 2, CH2CH3 has 3? Wait, OCH2CH3 is 2 H on O, and CH3 is 3 H. So for the ester OEt, that's 2+3=5 H. Benzoate (without the ester) is C7H5O2, which would have 5 H in the benzene. But when we make ethyl benzoate, it's C9H10O2. Wait, in D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you make the ester with ethyl, it becomes C9H10O2. But the 4-aminobenzoate would have an additional NH2 group, which adds another N and two H. So C9H11NO2. That matches. So option D fits the formula.

Looking back at the NMR for option D. The ethyl ester group would give a quartet at 4.5 ppm (the OCH2) and triplet at 1.2 (the CH3). Yes, that's what the NMR shows: 1.20 ppm (t,3H) and 4.5 ppm (q,2H). So that fits.

Then the 4.0 ppm (bs,2H). Wait, what's that? If it's ethyl ester, the OCH2 is at 4.5. Then why is there a peak at 4.0? Oh, wait, maybe the amino group. If the amino group is adjacent to something else. But in para-aminobenzoate, the amino group would be on the benzene ring. The NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Hmm, but NH2 would usually appear around 1-5 ppm, but more like 1.5-3 for amines. Or wait, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to the amino group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is the amino group as NH2, but that doesn't make sense for a singlet of 2H. Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. So the molecule is 4-aminobenzoate ester. The structure would be O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which has NH2 in the para position.

In the NMR, the ethyl group is accounted for in the 1.2 and 4.5 ppm peaks. Then, what about the NH2 group? The amine protons in aniline derivatives usually appear around 5-6 ppm as a broad peak, but that's for aniline. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe it's not NH2 but some other group.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Are there other functional groups? Let me check the IR again. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl, probably from the ester. So the 4.5 and 1.2 peaks are from the ester's ethyl group.

What about the 4.0 ppm peak? If it's a broad singlet for 2H, perhaps it's an N-linked group. Wait, in option D, the amine is NH2, which would be a broad peak, but for 2H. But amine protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-3 for NH2 in aniline. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, but the integration is 2H. Wait, but an NH2 would be two protons, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet of 2H. That might fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group, like in an amide.

Wait, but the IR shows N-H, which would be the amide (if it were an amide), but in option D it's an ester and an amine. Hmm, but wait, the amine would also show N-H in IR. So the IR has two N-H bands, which are medium to strong at 3420 and 3325. That's typical of an amide, which has two N-H stretches (primary amide). But in option D, it's an amine group, which would have a single N-H stretch, or maybe a broad one. Wait, but in the compound D, it's a primary amine, which would have a broad peak around 3300-3500, but it's usually a single peak, not two. So maybe the two peaks in IR are from an amide, which has two N-H groups.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. The IR would have an amide N-H, which fits. The NMR would have the ethoxy group as OCH2CH3, so the 1.2 triplet and 4.5 quartet. Then, the CONH2 would have NH2 signals. But in the given NMR, at 4.0 ppm, there's a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe the NH2 is not showing up in the NMR because it's a broad peak and perhaps overlapping or being exchanged. Alternatively, perhaps another group. But I'm not sure.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3-phenyl). The formamide has a NH, which would be a singlet around 8-9 ppm maybe, but in the given NMR, the aromatic is at 7 and 8. Wait, but the NH in formamide is usually around 8-9. The given NMR doesn't show such a peak, so maybe this isn't the case. Also, the ethoxy group would give the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The 4.0 ppm could be the CONH group, but that's a single proton, so integration would be 1H, not 2H. So perhaps option B is not a match.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. So it's a propionamide. The ester would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the amino group. The NMR would then have the ethyl group as triplet and quartet, which matches the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The amino group would be NH, which would show a broad peak. But the given NMR has 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). If it's NH, that would be a singlet for 1H, not 2H. Hmm, so this might not fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2 (para). So the ethyl ester gives the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The amino group is NH2, which would have two protons. The IR shows two N-H stretches, which could be from an amide (like in option A) but in this case, it's an amine. Wait, a primary amine's N-H would show a broad peak around 3300-3500. But in the IR, there are two bands, which might suggest an amide with two N-H groups. So maybe this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an amide. Let me check the options again. Option A is benzamide with an ethoxy group. So the structure would be OCH2CH2 attached to the benzene ring at position 3, and a CONH2 group. The IR shows two N-H bands, which amides usually have. The NMR would have the ethoxy group (1.2 and 4.5) and the CONH2 would have NH2 protons. But in the NMR given, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe that's the NH2 group? Wait, but NH2 protons are usually around 1-5 ppm and broad. But the integration is 2H. So if it's an amine, that would fit, but if it's an amide, the NH2 would be in a different region.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the 4.0 ppm peak. Maybe it's an OCH2 group attached to something else. Wait, looking back at the NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl's CH3
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, like O or N.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): ethyl's OCH2.

Hmm, maybe the 4.0 ppm is a CH2 connected to the amino group. Wait, in option D, the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene. That would mean the NMR wouldn't have any peaks for the NH2 except as a broad peak. But perhaps in the NMR, the NH2 is exchanging and not visible, or perhaps it's integrating to 2H, which would make sense if it's NH2.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If that's the NH2, then the amine is showing up in the NMR at 4 ppm. But in reality, amines can show up anywhere from 1-5 ppm, but for aniline derivatives, it's usually around 4-5 ppm. So maybe that's the case here.

Putting it all together, the NMR has the ethyl group (1.2 and 4.5), an aromatic ring with two doublets (para-substituted), and the 4.0 ppm (2H) could be the NH2 group as a broad singlet. That would fit option D.

Wait, but the IR has a strong band at 1720, which would be the ester carbonyl, which fits. The two N-H bands at 3420 and 3325 could be from the amine. Amine N-H stretches are usually around 3300-3500. So two bands might indicate two different N-H groups, but in a primary amine, there's usually only one. However, sometimes in certain environments, like if the amine is hydrogen bonded or in a different electronic environment, there could be two peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but option D is an ester and an amine.

So maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about option B again. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide would have a carbonyl at ~1720, which matches. The ethoxy group would give the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The formamide's NH would be around 8-9 ppm, but in the NMR, the aromatic is at 7 and 8. So perhaps the NH is at 8.0 ppm as a broad peak. But the given NMR at 8.0 is a doublet for 2H, which would be aromatic. So that's not matching. So option B is probably not correct.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 at position 3 and CONH2. The IR would have two N-H bands (amide), which matches. The NMR would have the ethoxy group (1.2 and 4.5), and the CONH2 would have NH2 protons. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2. But in the benzamide, the NH2 would be around 7-8 ppm as a broad peak, but the 4.0 is lower. Alternatively, perhaps in the NMR, the NH2 isn't showing up because it's exchanging quickly, and the 4.0 ppm is another group.

Wait, but the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. What else could that be? Maybe a CH2 group attached to something else. Oh, wait, maybe in another structure. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COONH-C6H4-4. So the propionamide would have a CONH group. The IR would have a carbonyl (1720) and N-H (amide). The NMR would have the ethyl group (1.2 and 4.5), the aromatic protons (d at 7 and 8), and the NH from the amide. But the given NMR has a 4.0 ppm peak for 2H, which could be the NH group if it's an amide. Wait, but amide NH is usually around 7-8 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 from the propionamide. So the structure is CH2CH2COO attached to NH-C6H4. Wait, but the CH2 near the amide would be split by the adjacent group. Not sure.

Back to option D. The structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. The NMR would have the ethyl group as 1.2 and 4.5, the aromatic as 7.0 and 8.0 (the two doublets), and the NH2 as a broad peak. If the NH2 is at 4.0 ppm, that's possible. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 protons. That makes sense because NH2 is a broad peak, and the integration is 2H. The IR shows two N-H bands, which could be from the amine's two protons, possibly showing two different stretches due to different hydrogen bonding or environments.

So putting it all together, the IR and NMR data match option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, I remember that the molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. Let me think about what functional groups are present here. The formula has 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. 

Looking at the IR data first. The strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches. Amide or amine groups usually show up in that region. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carbonyls in amides are typically around 1650-1750, so that could fit. Maybe it's an ester or an amide. Wait, but the presence of N-H in IR might point more towards an amide, but esters don't have N-H.

Now the NMR. Let's go through the peaks one by one. 

First peak: 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet with 3H suggests it's the end of a CH2CH3 group, so maybe connected to another CH2.

Next, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad could mean exchange, maybe an amide N-H, but wait, the integration is 2H. Alternatively, if it's an OCH2 group attached to something else. OCH2 might give a peak around 4 ppm, but why would it be broad? Maybe if it's adjacent to an electronegative group or if it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. Another thought: maybe it's the ethyl group's CH2 connected to another group, but that's more likely to be a triplet around 1.2.

Then, 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H – that's another CH2 group. The quartet suggests splitting from two neighboring groups, which usually happens when there are two neighboring protons. Wait, but if it's a quartet, maybe it's adjacent to a CH3. Like in an ethyl group, but earlier there was a triplet. Let me think: ethyl groups in esters or ethers. For example, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet and the CH3 as a triplet.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets each with 2H indicate two sets of protons, possibly in a para-substituted benzene, like two substituents opposite each other. For example, an OCH2CH3 group and another group on the benzene ring.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule is an ethyl ester of a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group, but wait, the NMR doesn't show a broad peak for NH2. The IR shows N-H, but if it's an amide, the NH would be around 3300-3500, which matches the IR given. But the NMR of benzamide would have more complex NH signals, but here the peak at 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe it's an N-alkyl group?

Wait, option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). The IR would have an amide N-H, which matches. The formamide group would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. In NMR, the ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm (since the CH3 would be triplet at 1.2). But wait, the NMR in the question has a quartet at 4.5 (2H) and a triplet at 1.2 (3H). So that could fit the ethoxy group. But where's the formamide's NH? The formamide has an NH, but it's a singlet as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit because formamide's NH would be around 8-9 ppm maybe. Wait, no. Wait, formamide's NH is typically around 8-9, but according to the NMR given, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0. So maybe that's not the case.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is O=C-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to NH-C6H4. Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH2-C6H4. Or wait, is it propionyl attached to the amino group? Maybe. Let me think. The propionate would be the ester group. Wait, but in this case, the amine might be a primary amine. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 (2H), maybe the ethyl group from propionic acid. Or perhaps it's the CH2 next to the ester oxygen. Hmm, but the quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2 suggests an ethyl group attached via oxygen, like an ethyl ester.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to a benzene ring with an amino group in the para position. So the benzene has -OEt and -NH2 groups in para positions. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the formula for D. Benzoate would be C7H5O2. Then the ethyl group is C2H5, so 7+2 =9 carbons. Hydrogens: benzoate is 5 H (from benzene), ethyl is 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 2, CH2CH3 has 3? Wait, OCH2CH3 is 2 H on O, and CH3 is 3 H. So for the ester OEt, that's 2+3=5 H. Benzoate (without the ester) is C7H5O2, which would have 5 H in the benzene. But when we make ethyl benzoate, it's C9H10O2. Wait, in D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you make the ester with ethyl, it becomes C9H10O2. But the 4-aminobenzoate would have an additional NH2 group, which adds another N and two H. So C9H11NO2. That matches. So option D fits the formula.

Looking back at the NMR for option D. The ethyl ester group would give a quartet at 4.5 ppm (the OCH2) and triplet at 1.2 (the CH3). Yes, that's what the NMR shows: 1.20 ppm (t,3H) and 4.5 ppm (q,2H). So that fits.

Then the 4.0 ppm (bs,2H). Wait, what's that? If it's ethyl ester, the OCH2 is at 4.5. Then why is there a peak at 4.0? Oh, wait, maybe the amino group. If the amino group is adjacent to something else. But in para-aminobenzoate, the amino group would be on the benzene ring. The NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Hmm, but NH2 would usually appear around 1-5 ppm, but more like 1.5-3 for amines. Or wait, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to the amino group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is the amino group as NH2, but that doesn't make sense for a singlet of 2H. Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. So the molecule is 4-aminobenzoate ester. The structure would be O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, which has NH2 in the para position.

In the NMR, the ethyl group is accounted for in the 1.2 and 4.5 ppm peaks. Then, what about the NH2 group? The amine protons in aniline derivatives usually appear around 5-6 ppm as a broad peak, but that's for aniline. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe it's not NH2 but some other group.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Are there other functional groups? Let me check the IR again. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl, probably from the ester. So the 4.5 and 1.2 peaks are from the ester's ethyl group.

What about the 4.0 ppm peak? If it's a broad singlet for 2H, perhaps it's an N-linked group. Wait, in option D, the amine is NH2, which would be a broad peak, but for 2H. But amine protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but more like 2-3 for NH2 in aniline. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, but the integration is 2H. Wait, but an NH2 would be two protons, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet of 2H. That might fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group, like in an amide.

Wait, but the IR shows N-H, which would be the amide (if it were an amide), but in option D it's an ester and an amine. Hmm, but wait, the amine would also show N-H in IR. So the IR has two N-H bands, which are medium to strong at 3420 and 3325. That's typical of an amide, which has two N-H stretches (primary amide). But in option D, it's an amine group, which would have a single N-H stretch, or maybe a broad one. Wait, but in the compound D, it's a primary amine, which would have a broad peak around 3300-3500, but it's usually a single peak, not two. So maybe the two peaks in IR are from an amide, which has two N-H groups.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure is benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3. The IR would have an amide N-H, which fits. The NMR would have the ethoxy group as OCH2CH3, so the 1.2 triplet and 4.5 quartet. Then, the CONH2 would have NH2 signals. But in the given NMR, at 4.0 ppm, there's a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe the NH2 is not showing up in the NMR because it's a broad peak and perhaps overlapping or being exchanged. Alternatively, perhaps another group. But I'm not sure.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON-(4-OCH2CH3-phenyl). The formamide has a NH, which would be a singlet around 8-9 ppm maybe, but in the given NMR, the aromatic is at 7 and 8. Wait, but the NH in formamide is usually around 8-9. The given NMR doesn't show such a peak, so maybe this isn't the case. Also, the ethoxy group would give the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The 4.0 ppm could be the CONH group, but that's a single proton, so integration would be 1H, not 2H. So perhaps option B is not a match.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. So it's a propionamide. The ester would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the amino group. The NMR would then have the ethyl group as triplet and quartet, which matches the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The amino group would be NH, which would show a broad peak. But the given NMR has 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). If it's NH, that would be a singlet for 1H, not 2H. Hmm, so this might not fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2 (para). So the ethyl ester gives the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The amino group is NH2, which would have two protons. The IR shows two N-H stretches, which could be from an amide (like in option A) but in this case, it's an amine. Wait, a primary amine's N-H would show a broad peak around 3300-3500. But in the IR, there are two bands, which might suggest an amide with two N-H groups. So maybe this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an amide. Let me check the options again. Option A is benzamide with an ethoxy group. So the structure would be OCH2CH2 attached to the benzene ring at position 3, and a CONH2 group. The IR shows two N-H bands, which amides usually have. The NMR would have the ethoxy group (1.2 and 4.5) and the CONH2 would have NH2 protons. But in the NMR given, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe that's the NH2 group? Wait, but NH2 protons are usually around 1-5 ppm and broad. But the integration is 2H. So if it's an amine, that would fit, but if it's an amide, the NH2 would be in a different region.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the 4.0 ppm peak. Maybe it's an OCH2 group attached to something else. Wait, looking back at the NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl's CH3
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, like O or N.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): ethyl's OCH2.

Hmm, maybe the 4.0 ppm is a CH2 connected to the amino group. Wait, in option D, the structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene. That would mean the NMR wouldn't have any peaks for the NH2 except as a broad peak. But perhaps in the NMR, the NH2 is exchanging and not visible, or perhaps it's integrating to 2H, which would make sense if it's NH2.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If that's the NH2, then the amine is showing up in the NMR at 4 ppm. But in reality, amines can show up anywhere from 1-5 ppm, but for aniline derivatives, it's usually around 4-5 ppm. So maybe that's the case here.

Putting it all together, the NMR has the ethyl group (1.2 and 4.5), an aromatic ring with two doublets (para-substituted), and the 4.0 ppm (2H) could be the NH2 group as a broad singlet. That would fit option D.

Wait, but the IR has a strong band at 1720, which would be the ester carbonyl, which fits. The two N-H bands at 3420 and 3325 could be from the amine. Amine N-H stretches are usually around 3300-3500. So two bands might indicate two different N-H groups, but in a primary amine, there's usually only one. However, sometimes in certain environments, like if the amine is hydrogen bonded or in a different electronic environment, there could be two peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but option D is an ester and an amine.

So maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about option B again. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCON attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide would have a carbonyl at ~1720, which matches. The ethoxy group would give the 1.2 and 4.5 peaks. The formamide's NH would be around 8-9 ppm, but in the NMR, the aromatic is at 7 and 8. So perhaps the NH is at 8.0 ppm as a broad peak. But the given NMR at 8.0 is a doublet for 2H, which would be aromatic. So that's not matching. So option B is probably not correct.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 at position 3 and CONH2. The IR would have two N-H bands (amide), which matches. The NMR would have the ethoxy group (1.2 and 4.5), and the CONH2 would have NH2 protons. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2. But in the benzamide, the NH2 would be around 7-8 ppm as a broad peak, but the 4.0 is lower. Alternatively, perhaps in the NMR, the NH2 isn't showing up because it's exchanging quickly, and the 4.0 ppm is another group.

Wait, but the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. What else could that be? Maybe a CH2 group attached to something else. Oh, wait, maybe in another structure. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COONH-C6H4-4. So the propionamide would have a CONH group. The IR would have a carbonyl (1720) and N-H (amide). The NMR would have the ethyl group (1.2 and 4.5), the aromatic protons (d at 7 and 8), and the NH from the amide. But the given NMR has a 4.0 ppm peak for 2H, which could be the NH group if it's an amide. Wait, but amide NH is usually around 7-8 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 from the propionamide. So the structure is CH2CH2COO attached to NH-C6H4. Wait, but the CH2 near the amide would be split by the adjacent group. Not sure.

Back to option D. The structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2. So the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. The NMR would have the ethyl group as 1.2 and 4.5, the aromatic as 7.0 and 8.0 (the two doublets), and the NH2 as a broad peak. If the NH2 is at 4.0 ppm, that's possible. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would be the NH2 protons. That makes sense because NH2 is a broad peak, and the integration is 2H. The IR shows two N-H bands, which could be from the amine's two protons, possibly showing two different stretches due to different hydrogen bonding or environments.

So putting it all together, the IR and NMR data match option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
