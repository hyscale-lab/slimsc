Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what each part of this reaction means. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, I think that's a typo or maybe the way it's written is confusing. Let me think. Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene. Because "1-bromo benzene-2-d" doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Wait, the exact structure might matter a lot here.

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me try to parse the name. 1-bromobenzene-2-d—I'm not sure. Maybe it's 2-bromo-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene? No, that doesn't fit either. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, which would have a bromine on the benzene ring at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2. But that doesn't make sense in terms of numbering. Oh wait, maybe the correct structure is 2-bromo-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-bromo-1,4-dimethylbenzene. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the correct name is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. 

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. Let me try to visualize that. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 2, and methyl groups at positions 1 and 3. So the ring is numbered such that the bromine is at carbon 2, and methyl groups are at 1 and 3. Or wait, maybe the bromine is at position 1, and the other substituents are at positions 2 and maybe another position. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the bromine is at position 1, methyl groups at 2 and 4. 

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, I might not be able to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the correct name is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. Let's proceed under that assumption. So, the benzene ring has a bromine at position 2, methyl groups at positions 1 and 3. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are all substituted.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so maybe the structure is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that could lead to different products upon elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-bromo-1-methylbenzene, but that would be less substituted.

Wait, but the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and is often used for elimination reactions, especially dehydrohalogenation. So, if we have a benzyl bromide or a bromobenzene derivative, the reaction could lead to either elimination or substitution. Wait, but in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good solvent for elimination reactions.

So, the reaction type here is likely elimination, leading to the formation of an alkyne or perhaps a diene, depending on the structure.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. Another thought: If we have a bromobenzene ring with substituents, perhaps it's undergoing a benzidine elimination, but that's more about aromatic amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, where the bromide leaves, and a double bond forms. But wait, benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds. So, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is bromobenzene with two methyl groups in such a way that upon treatment with a strong base like NaNH2, we get a benzyne intermediate. Oh! I think I've heard about that. So, for example, when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate to form benzyne. But wait, the starting material here is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which I'm not entirely sure about, but perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the positions 1, 2, and 4 have substituents.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting material is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. So, the ring has a bromine at position 2 and methyl groups at positions 1 and 3.

Wait, but in any case, when NaNH2 is used, it's a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, perhaps the reaction is elimination to form a triple bond? Because benzyne is an aryne, which is a highly strained triple bond in a ring. So, if there are two leaving groups in the ring, the base can abstract a proton, leading to elimination and formation of a triple bond. But wait, our starting material has only one bromine. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, which would be 2,6-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene? Because sometimes substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene.

Wait, regardless, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation. So, if we have a bromine on the benzene ring next to a methyl group, the base could abstract a proton, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. But wait, benzene already has double bonds, so maybe it's about forming a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But with NaNH2, a strong base, maybe the reaction is more about elimination than substitution. Let me think about the mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the starting material is a methyl bromide attached to the benzene ring. So, perhaps it's a benzyl bromide structure. But wait, the name 1-bromobenzene-2-d suggests the bromine is directly attached to the benzene ring, not the benzyl position.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. So, the ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 and bromine at position 2. So, if I imagine the benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 each have substituents.

Now, when treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, the base could abstract a proton beta to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But since the ring is already conjugated, maybe this leads to the formation of a triple bond, creating benzyne. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming a meta or para substituted benzyne.

Wait, but usually, benzyne formation requires two leaving groups. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene would eliminate two HBr molecules to form benzyne. So, perhaps the starting material here is a bromobenzene with another substituent that can leave, but in this case, perhaps the methyl groups are in positions that allow for such elimination.

Wait, no. Because in the starting material, I'm only seeing one bromine. So perhaps this isn't the case. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the bromide leaves, and ammonia acts as a nucleophile, but that would give a substituted benzene with an amine group, which doesn’t seem to fit with the possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the starting material has two substituents which are both leaving groups, but the name given doesn't make that clear. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that to happen, the ring needs to be activated towards substitution, which usually requires strong activating groups, like amino groups. But in this case, we have methyl groups, which are activating but deactivating because they are electron-donating through sigma bonds.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps the mechanism is elimination. So, if the bromine is in such a position that when the base abstracts a proton, it can form a double bond, but I'm not sure how that would proceed on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond, leading to benzyne, which can undergo further reactions. But to form benzyne, two leaving groups are needed, so perhaps the starting material has two bromine atoms or a bromine and another leaving group. But the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which I'm unsure about.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from the carbon adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. That would form benzyne in that position. But then, how many products would that lead to?

Wait, once the benzyne is formed, it can undergo various reactions, like [2+4] cycloaddition with another diene, but in this case, perhaps the question is about the number of elimination products, not further reactions.

Wait, but if the starting material can form benzyne in more than one way, leading to different structures, then the number of products would depend on the possible positions of elimination.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. Suppose the starting material is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (methyl), 2 (bromine), and 3 (methyl). So, the bromine is between two methyl groups. Now, when NaNH2 is added, the base would abstract a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the bromine. The adjacent positions are positions 1 and 3 (since it's a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to two others).

Wait, so the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 1 or position 3, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond. But wait, if that's the case, then elimination could occur in two different ways, leading to two different products.

But wait, in this case, since positions 1 and 3 are both methyl groups, and the bromine is at position 2, the structure is symmetric between positions 1 and 3. So, eliminating from either position would lead to the same product: a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but wait, that might not be right.

Wait, no. Because if the hydrogen is abstracted from position 1, elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Similarly, abstracting a hydrogen from position 3 would form a triple bond between positions 2 and 3. But wait, the ring is symmetric, so those two positions (1 and 3) are equivalent. So, would those two eliminations lead to the same product or different ones?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's symmetry makes the two possible eliminations lead to the same product. So, only one product is formed.

But wait, another possibility: Maybe the starting material is such that elimination can occur in more than one unique position, leading to more than one product. Let's think. Suppose the starting material is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. The base could abstract a hydrogen from either position 1 or position 3, leading to elimination and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3. But considering the ring's symmetry, positions 1 and 3 are equivalent, so the product would be the same in both cases. Thus, only one product is formed.

Wait, but is that the case? If the structure is symmetric, then yes. So, elimination from either position leads to the same benzyne structure. So, only one product of elimination occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing other possible positions where elimination could occur. For example, maybe the bromine is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. In that case, the adjacent positions would be 2 and 6. But wait, position 6 isn't a methyl group, perhaps. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Another angle: The reaction is dehydrohalogenation, which requires a hydrogen adjacent to the leaving group. In this case, the leaving group is Br at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. So, if the structure is 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene, then positions 2 and 6 each have methyl groups. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either position 2 or 6, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6.

Wait, but in that scenario, the two possible eliminations would form two different products, because the triple bonds are between 1-2 and 1-6. However, in the benzene ring, 1-2 and 1-6 are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So, those would actually be the same product. So, only one product would form.

Wait, but wait. Let me imagine the structure. If the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups are at positions 2 and 6, then elimination could occur from either position 2 or 6. But because of the ring's symmetry, those two positions are mirror images, so the products would be identical. Thus, only one product forms.

But then, the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. If elimination occurs in a single way, then the answer is 1 product. Alternatively, perhaps there's more than one way, but symmetry reduces the number.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material allows for multiple possible eliminations, leading to more than one product.

Wait, another scenario: Suppose the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. Then, the adjacent positions to bromine are 2 and 6. So, eliminating from 2 would lead to a triple bond between 1 and 2, and eliminating from 6 (if there's a hydrogen) would lead to a triple bond between 1 and 6. But the methyl groups are at 2 and 4, so position 6 is a hydrogen? Wait, no, because the substituents are at 2 and 4; position 6 is adjacent to 1, which is bromine, but it's not a methyl group.

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the ring has Br at 1, methyl at 2, and methyl at 4. The adjacent carbons to Br are 2 (which has a methyl) and 6 (which is hydrogen). So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6. But position 2 is a methyl, so no H there. Wait, but position 2 is a methyl group; so no H to abstract. So, the only possible elimination is from position 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, in that case, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6. But because the ring is symmetric, perhaps that's the same as another position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible products.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure leads to two possible products. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the starting material has two methyl groups that are in positions that allow for two different elimination pathways, leading to two distinct products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't just eliminate once but can form multiple products based on where the elimination occurs. So, if the starting material allows for elimination in two different positions, leading to two different triple bonds, then two products would form.

Wait, but considering the symmetry, perhaps those two would be the same. So, perhaps only one product is formed.

Another possibility: The reaction could lead to more than one product if the starting material has multiple possible sites for elimination that are not equivalent. For example, if the methyl groups are at positions that don't mirror each other, leading to different triple bond positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene, where the bromine is at position 2, and methyl groups at 1 and 3. So, the adjacent positions are 1 and 3. Thus, elimination could occur from either of those positions. But since positions 1 and 3 are symmetric relative to position 2, the products would be the same. So, only one product forms.

Alternatively, if the starting material has the bromine in a position where elimination can occur in two different ways that lead to different products, then more than one product would form.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 2 products. Let me think about another scenario. Suppose the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. The positions adjacent to Br are 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). So, can the base abstract a hydrogen from position 6? If so, elimination leads to a triple bond between 1 and 6. But since the ring is symmetric, position 6 is equivalent to position 4? No, not exactly. Wait, position 6 is next to position 1 and 5. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene, and elimination from either position 1 or 3 leads to the same product because of symmetry. So, only one product forms.

Another possible reaction: Maybe after elimination, the product is a diene instead of a triple bond. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, but it's also a good nucleophile. So, maybe the reaction is substitution, but on the aromatic ring. However, aromatic substitution typically requires specific conditions, like a strongly activating group. Methyl groups are activating, but I'm not sure if they're sufficient for substitution with a strong base like NaNH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination forming a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne), which can then react further. But the question is about the products of this reaction, which is just the elimination step.

Wait, but the question says "how many possible organic products are there in this reaction?" So, perhaps the reaction produces only one product, hence option B (1) would be correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: Maybe the starting material can eliminate in two different ways, leading to two products. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that elimination can occur in two distinct positions, leading to two different triple bonds.

Wait, let me imagine the structure: 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. The Br is at position 2, methyl at 1 and 3. So, elimination could occur from position 1 or 3. But because of the ring's symmetry, positions 1 and 3 are equivalent. So, only one product forms.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the methyl groups are at positions 1 and 4, and the Br is at 2, then elimination from 1 and 3 would be different. Wait, but position 4 is across from position 2, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the reaction leads to only one product because of the structure's symmetry.

So, putting it all together, the number of products is 1. So, the answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is interpreted as 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene, where the bromine is at position 2, and methyl groups are at positions 1 and 3. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction likely proceeds via dehydrohalogenation, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a benzyne intermediate (a highly strained triple bond in the benzene ring).

In this structure, the bromine at position 2 is adjacent to two methyl groups at positions 1 and 3. The base can abstract a hydrogen atom from either position 1 or position 3, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1-2 or 2-3. However, due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, these two elimination pathways result in the same product. Therefore, only one unique organic product is formed in this reaction.
