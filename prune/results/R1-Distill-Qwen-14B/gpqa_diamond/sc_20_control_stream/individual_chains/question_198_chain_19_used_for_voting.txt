Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the formation of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (also known as formation constants) for the different complexes are provided: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. 

We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, wait. The blue dithiocyanato complex—so I'm guessing that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex or maybe another one? I remember that in the case of cobalt complexes, the color changes depending on the number of SCN- ligands attached. For example, Co(SCN)2^2+ is blue, I think. But maybe I should double-check that later.

So, the problem is about the distribution of different Co complexes in solution. We've got multiple complexes possible here. Let me list them out based on the stability constants:

The stability constants, β, are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Typically, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, β1 would be for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, β3 for Co(SCN)3, β4 for Co(SCN)4.

But wait, some sources might number them differently, but I think the standard is that βn is for the complex with n ligands. So, the complexes are:

- Co^2+ (free ion)
- Co(SCN)^2+ (n=1, β1=9)
- Co(SCN)_2^2+ (n=2, β2=40)
- Co(SCN)_3^2- (n=3, β3=63)
- Co(SCN)_4^2- (n=4, β4=16)

Wait, wait. Stability constants are for each step. The overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of the stepwise constants. Wait, no, wait—actually, the β given here might be the cumulative formation constant for each step. Or are they stepwise? Hmm, this is a point where I might get tripped up.

Wait, the stepwise formation constant is the constant for adding each ligand. So, for example:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co(SCN)]^2+ [SCN^-])

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3]^2- / ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+ [SCN^-])

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4]^2- / ([Co(SCN)_3]^2- [SCN^-])

Wait, but wait, some sources define the overall formation constant as the product of the stepwise constants. So, the overall β for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1*β2*...*βn. But wait, in this problem, the given β1, β2, etc., are the overall stability constants for each step. Or are they the stepwise constants? Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the problem states that these are the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. So I think each βn is the cumulative constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So:

β1 = Kf for Co(SCN)^2+ → [Co(SCN)]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9.

β2 = Kf for Co(SCN)_2^2+ → [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40.

β3 = Kf for Co(SCN)_3^2- → [Co(SCN)_3]^2- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63.

β4 = Kf for Co(SCN)_4^2- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2- / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the stepwise constants would be βn = [CoL_n]/([CoL_{n-1}}][L]).

So, the stepwise constants would be the ratios between successive βs. For example, the second stepwise constant β2' would be β2 / β1.

So, perhaps the given β's are the overall formation constants for each complex, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps each βn is the stepwise constant for the nth ligand. Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So, which is it?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dominant species. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Let me think: dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands, so Co(SCN)_2^2+.

So, I need to find the fraction of Co present as Co(SCN)_2^2+. To do that, I have to consider all possible complexes and the free ion.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each species, then sum them, and find the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+.

But to calculate the fractions, I need to use the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN- and Co.

Wait, the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all Co species ([Co^2+], [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^2-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-) equals 1e-2 M.

But calculating each term would require knowing the fraction of each, which depends on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Alternatively, I can model this using the formation of each complex step by step.

But perhaps the simplest approach is to use the distribution of species based on the given stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, I think the general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the formula:

Fraction of species n = βn * [SCN^-]^n / (denominator)

Where the denominator is the sum over all species of (βm * [SCN^-]^m ), for m from 0 to 4.

Wait, because for each species, the formation is [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but the denominator would be the sum over all possible species' terms, each being βm * [SCN^-]^m.

Wait, no, more accurately, each species is [Co(SCN)_n]^2- (or charge accordingly) = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all [Co species].

Let me denote the free Co^2+ as [Co] = x. Wait, but that's not the case. Actually, the total Co is the sum of all the species:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^2- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But each [Co(SCN)_n]^2- can be written as βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So substituting all of them into the total Co equation:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1 + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

We can factor out [Co^2+] as common:

Total Co = [Co^2+] ( 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Let me denote S = [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So,

Total Co = [Co^2+] ( 1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

So, [Co^2+] = Total Co / (1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

Then, once we have [Co^2+], the fraction of each species is [Co(SCN)_n]^2- / Total Co = (βn S^n [Co^2+]) / Total Co.

Which simplifies to (βn S^n) / (1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

Because [Co^2+] is (Total Co) / denominator, so when you take (βn S^n [Co^2+]) / Total Co, it's (βn S^n) / denominator.

So, the fraction of each species is (βn S^n) divided by the sum of (βm S^m) for m from 0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, m=0 is β0 S^0, which is 1 (since β0 is 1, as the free ion is [Co^2+], which is β0=1). So the denominator becomes:

sum from m=0 to 4 of (βm S^m).

Therefore, for each species n, the fraction is (βn S^n) / sum_{m=0}^4 (βm S^m )

So, let's compute the denominator first.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second—hold on. Because the way the β's are given is a bit confusing. Are the β's the overall formation constants, or are they the stepwise constants? Because earlier I thought that each βn is the stepwise constant for the nth ligand. Or maybe each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex.

Wait, let me think again. If the given β's are the stepwise formation constants, then the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. But if the given β's are the overall constants, then each term is as I thought earlier.

Wait, in the problem statement, the β's are the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. So, for each complex Co(SCN)_n], βn is its stability constant. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.

So, in that case, for each n:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, each term in the denominator is βn * S^n.

So the denominator is:

β0 * S^0 + β1 * S^1 + β2 * S^2 + β3 * S^3 + β4 * S^4

But wait, β0 is the stability constant for the free ion, which is 1. S^0 is 1. So,

Denominator D = 1 + (9)(0.1) + (40)(0.1)^2 + (63)(0.1)^3 + (16)(0.1)^4

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute each term:

β0 S^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

β1 S^1 =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 S^2=40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

β3 S^3 =63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

β4 S^4=16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

Now, summing these up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9 → plus 0.4 is 2.3 → plus 0.063 is 2.363 → plus 0.0016 is 2.3646.

So denominator D = 2.3646.

So, the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction of each species is (βn S^n) / D.

But we're interested in the fraction of the dithiocyanate complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^2+. So n=2.

So, the fraction f2 is (β2 S^2) / D = (40 * (0.1)^2 ) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator: 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

So f2 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but that would be option D) 16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute each term again:

β1 S =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 S^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3 S^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

β4 S^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum:1 + 0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Then, for n=2, β2 S^2 =0.4.

0.4/2.3646 = approximately 0.169 → 16.9%.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So, if Co(SCN)2^2+ is blue, then the answer is D) 16.9%.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned. The calculated value is 16.9%, but are there any other factors I might have missed? For example, is the stability constant given correctly? Let me make sure I used the right β.

The question says that β1=9, β2=40, etc. So, for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), β2 is 40.

Wait, but wait! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because sometimes the stability constants are given as the stepwise constants, not the overall. So, for example, β1 is the stepwise constant for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. Then the overall βn would be the product β1*β2*...*βn.

Hmm, this complicates things because if the given βs are stepwise, then the overall β for, say, n=2 would be β1*β2. But in the problem statement, the given β2 is 40. So perhaps I'm mixing up the two concepts.

Let me clarify:

If the given βn are the stepwise constants, then the overall β for Co(SCN)_n is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

In that case, the overall β for each species would be:

For n=1, β1=9.

n=2, β1*β2 =9 *40= 360.

n=3, 9*40*63 = 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680.

n=4, 22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but in the problem, the given βs are the "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes". So if β2 is the stability constant for the second complex, then it's 40, which would suggest that the given βs are the overall constants, not the stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps each βn is the stepwise constant, and the overall for each complex is the product up to n.

Wait, but that would change the approach. Let me reevaluate.

If the given βn are the stepwise formation constants, then:

β1 = K1 = [Co(SCN)]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co(SCN)]^2+ [SCN^-])

β3 = K3 = [Co(SCN)_3]^2- / ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+ [SCN^-])

β4 = K4 = [Co(SCN)_4]^2- / ([Co(SCN)_3]^2- [SCN^-])

Then, the overall stability constants (β_total) for each complex would be:

β_total for n=1: β1.

n=2: β1 * β2.

n=3: β1 * β2 * β3.

n=4: β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

In that case, the denominator for the fraction would be:

1 + (β1 S) + (β1 β2 S^2) + (β1 β2 β3 S^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 S^4).

So, let me compute each term:

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. S=0.1.

So,

Term for n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 * S =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

n=2: 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6.

n=3: 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) * 0.001 → 22.68.

n=4: 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute step by step:

9 *40= 360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16= 362880.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001 =36.288.

So, the denominator D is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Adding these up:

1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Then, the fraction for each complex is ( β_total * S^n ) / D.

So for Co(SCN)_2^2+ (n=2), the fraction is (β1*β2 * S^2 ) / D.

Compute that:

β1*β2= 9*40=360.

S^2=0.01.

So 360 *0.01=3.6.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, or about 5.56%.

Wait, that's a big difference from the earlier approach. Hmm, this is confusing because I'm not sure whether the given βs are stepwise or overall.

Wait, the problem statement says: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Stability constants (β) are typically the overall constants for the entire complex. So for Co(SCN)_2^2+, the β would be 40, meaning β2=40.

In that case, the first approach is correct, and the fraction is 16.9%.

But wait, that's conflicting with the second approach where if βs are stepwise, the fraction is 5.56%.

So the confusion arises from whether βn is the overall or stepwise constant.

Wait, I think I should double-check what the term "stability constant" refers to. The stability constant (formation constant) for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its constituent ions. So, for Co(SCN)_n, the stability constant is given by:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So if that's the case, then the given βs are the overall constants, and the first approach is correct.

So, in that scenario, the denominator D is 2.3646, and the fraction for n=2 is 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 or 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the problem statement says that β4=16. So for the fourth complex, β4=16. If the approach is correct, then the first approach holds.

Wait, another way to think about it: the higher the βn, the more stable the complex. So, looking at β3=63, which is the highest, so Co(SCN)_3 would be the most dominant species. But according to our denominator in the first approach, the denominator D is 2.3646, which would mean that the majority of Co is in the form of Co(SCN)_3.

But let's compute the fractions for each species with the first approach:

n=0: 1 → 1/2.3646 ≈ 0.423 → 42.3%.

n=1: 0.9 → 0.9/2.3646≈0.381 → 38.1%.

n=2: 0.4 → 16.9%.

n=3:0.063 → ~2.66%.

n=4:0.0016 → ~0.067%.

Wait, that's a problem because the sum of the fractions should be 100%, but according to this, the sum is 42.3 +38.1 +16.9 +2.66 +0.067 ≈ 100%.

Wait, but according to the denominator, the sum is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 =2.3646. So each term divided by 2.3646 gives fractions that add to 1. So, the fractions are as I calculated.

But wait, in this calculation, the free Co^2+ is the largest fraction (42.3%), which is higher than any of the complexes. That seems a bit counterintuitive, but perhaps it's correct given the concentrations.

Wait, but SCN- is present at 0.1 M. Is that high enough to form the complexes extensively?

Wait, let's think about the ligand concentration. If S is 0.1 M, and the βn*S^n terms are significant, then higher-order complexes may form more.

In our case, β3=63, and S^3=0.001. So β3 S^3=63 *0.001=0.063. But in the denominator, the term for n=3 is 0.063, which is smaller than the term for n=1 (0.9) and n=2 (0.4). Wait, but in the denominator, the highest term is from n=1: 0.9, which is bigger than n=0 (1), n=2 (0.4), etc.

Wait, so in this case, the free Co^2+ (n=0) is the highest fraction (42.3%), followed by n=1 (38.1%), then n=2 (16.9%), then n=3 (2.66%), and n=4 (0.067%).

Wait, so the dominant species are the free Co^2+ and the monodentate complex. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. According to the calculation, that's 16.9%, option D.

But let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the denominator. Let me recompute D.

D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016.

1 is 1.0.

Add 0.9 → 1.9.

Add 0.4 → 2.3.

Add 0.063 → 2.363.

Add 0.0016 →2.3646.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 /2.3646 = 0.4 /2.3646.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 × 0.169 = ?

0.169 ×2 = 0.338.

0.169 ×0.3 =0.0507 → total 0.3887.

0.169 ×0.0646 ≈ 0.0109.

So 0.338 +0.0507 +0.0109 ≈ 0.3996.

Which is close to 0.4, so 0.169 is indeed 0.4/2.3646.

So, the percentage is about 16.9%.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.

But wait, the options are:

A) 42.3% → which is the fraction for n=0 (free Co^2+).

B)25.6% → ?

C)38.1% →n=1.

D)16.9% →n=2.

So, the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each cobalt species is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{D}
   \]
   where \( D \) is the denominator:
   \[
   D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]

2. **Compute \( D \)**:
   - \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \)
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

   Summing these terms:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of Co(SCN)₂²⁺**:
   For \( n = 2 \), the fraction is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

4. **Percentage of Co(SCN)₂²⁺**:
   The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

ANSWER: D
