Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So, the structure must be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but wait, no, because it has a cis-alkene. Oh right, a cis-alkene would mean the two substituents on the double bond are on the same side. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Oh, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond somewhere. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but the CH2-CH2 part is a double bond, so HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, wait, that would be a trans or cis arrangement. Or perhaps it's a four-carbon chain with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH no, wait, that's not a double bond. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure after dehydration.

The dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. So, the acid loses a water molecule to form an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its 1H NMR. 7 ppm is typically indicative of aromatic protons, but wait, this is an anhydride. Anhydrides usually have carbonyl groups but not aromatic rings. Oh wait, another possibility—maybe the anhydride has an alkene. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration typically forms an anhydride by removing a water from two -COOH groups. But wait, if the starting material has a cis-alkene, perhaps the dehydration leads to a cyclic anhydride. For example, a five-membered ring is possible if the acid has four carbons in a row, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Dehydration would form a cyclic structure, maybe a five-membered ring, which is more stable.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, that's confusing because an anhydride's protons are typically in the alkyl regions. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me think. If the anhydride is cyclic, like a five-membered ring, maybe it has some protons. Wait, but if the original molecule had a cis-alkene, dehydration would form an anhydride, perhaps a bicyclic structure or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride has an aromatic ring? Wait, the initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid, not an aromatic compound. Hmm, maybe the 7 ppm is from some other proton, like an AB system or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton. Wait, but cyclopentadiene would react with anhydrides in a Diels-Alder reaction, so perhaps the anhydride is a dienophile.

Wait, the next part says that the anhydride is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Oh, right! The Diels-Alder reaction. The anhydride would act as a dienophile, and the cyclopentadiene as the diene. So the product would be a six-membered cyclohexene derivative with substituents from the anhydride attached.

The products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3. Let me calculate the molecular weight. The anhydride would come from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is HOOC-(something)-COOH. When dehydrated, it loses one water (H2O) and becomes the anhydride. So the molecular formula of the anhydride is CxHyO3, assuming the acid was Cx+2Hy+2O4? Wait, maybe I should compute it. The acid is HOOC-R-COOH. So when it dehydrates, it becomes (RCO)2O, which is R(CO)2O. The formula for the acid would be CnH2nO4, assuming R is CnH2n-2. Wait, maybe I'm getting lost here.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is something like succinic anhydride, which is (CH2)2(CO)2O. So its formula is C4H6O3. Then, when it reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C9H12, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring. The product would have the sum of the two: (C4H6O3) + (C9H12) → C13H18O3. But the product formula is C13H16O3, which is two hydrogens less. Wait, perhaps elimination occurs, or maybe the product is a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe the diene is more substituted.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So it's a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So the structure is a cyclopentadiene ring where each of the four carbons has a methyl group. Wait, that's impossible because a cyclopentadiene has five carbons. So positions 1,3 are double bonds, and 2,4,5 have methyl groups. Wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, the structure is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So carbons 1 and 3 each have two methyl groups? Wait, maybe the positions are arranged as such: the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, so the ring is 1,2,3,4,5, with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Then each of carbons 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group. So that makes four methyl groups in total.

So when this reacts with the anhydride via Diels-Alder, the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene (which is the diene part), and the anhydride is the dienophile. Diels-Alder adds the diene and dienophile to form a six-membered ring with substituents.

The reaction would form a bicyclic structure, perhaps, since the diene is part of a ring. So the product would be a bicyclo structure with the substituents from the anhydride.

Now, the problem says the reaction yields two products: a major and a minor product. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major and minor likely come from different regiochemistry in the Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the Diels-Alder is stereospecific, so maybe it's about endo vs exo, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile could attack from different faces, leading to different stereochemistry in the substituents.

The key part is the NMR. The 2D NOESY spectra show a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons. So in the major product, two protons are close in space, leading to a cross-peak. In the minor product, they're not. So the structure difference between the two products must affect the proximity of certain protons.

The question is, which two resonances are connected in the major product's NOESY? The options give various possibilities.

So, the options talk about 6H singlets, 1H doublets, and 2H singlets in certain regions.

Let's think about the structure after Diels-Alder. The anhydride would add across the diene, leading to a six-membered ring. The substituents from the anhydride would be in the endo or exo positions, and their arrangement would influence the NMR.

In the major product, the substituents from the anhydride are probably in an endo transition state, which is more favorable. So the substituents would be positioned in such a way that certain protons are close in space.

The anhydride structure: the NMR data says the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR. Wait, 7 ppm is usually aromatic, but maybe it's a vinyl proton. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a conjugated system. Wait, but the starting material is a cis-alkene, so when dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride. Let me think about the structure. For example, if the starting acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a cis-alkene in the middle (but that's not a dicarboxylic acid). Wait, no, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, so maybe HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that can't be because that would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond. Wait, but if it's a cyclic anhydride, maybe it's a five-membered ring. Let me think. For example, if the acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH, which is butanedioic acid, which upon dehydration forms the cyclic anhydride, which is succinic anhydride. Its structure is a five-membered ring: O=C-(CH2)2-C=O, with an oxygen connecting the two ketones. So the NMR of succinic anhydride: the protons adjacent to the carbonyls are two CH2 groups, which are each split into quartets because of coupling. But in this problem, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't match. Because in succinic anhydride, the protons are around 4 ppm or so, as they are adjacent to carbonyls.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is something else. Could it be a maleic anhydride? No, maleic is a dienophile, but the starting material is a cis-alkene. Wait, when a cis-dioic acid is dehydrated, it forms a cis-anhydride. For example, HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH would be butanedioic acid. If the double bond is in the middle, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that's a diene, not an anhydride. Wait, no, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's a fumaric acid derivative. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which upon dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride. But wait, when fumaric acid dehydrates, it forms maleic anhydride, which is an anhydride with a double bond.

Ah, wait! Maleic anhydride is indeed formed from fumaric acid. So the starting material is fumaric acid (cis- because fumaric is the cis isomer). So the anhydride would be maleic anhydride, which has the structure O=C-(C=O)-O connected in a cyclic way. Wait, no, maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bonds: it's a cyclic structure where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, connected by a double bond. The structure is O=C-(C-O)-C=O, but I might be getting the connectivity wrong.

In any case, the 13C NMR of the anhydride shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond (like a CH in an alkene), and 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon. Wait, but anhydrides have two carbonyls. So maybe the NMR shows two carbonyls, but in the question, it's two peaks, so perhaps one is for each carbonyl. So maybe both carbonyls are equivalent, giving a single peak, but wait, the question says two peaks in 13C. Hmm, perhaps the anhydride has two different carbonyl groups. Or wait, maybe it's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is not symmetric, leading to two different carbonyl carbons.

Wait, maleic anhydride has two equivalent carbonyl carbons because of the symmetry. So in that case, the 13C NMR would show only one peak for the carbonyls. But the question says two peaks in the 13C spectrum: 137 and 165. Hmm, so maybe the anhydride has another type of carbon. For example, in maleic anhydride, there are the carbonyl carbons (around ~170 ppm) and the adjacent carbons (like the CH that's part of the double bond), which are around ~125-135 ppm. Maybe the 137 ppm is the CH in the double bond, and 165 is the carbonyl.

But then, why does the 1H NMR of the anhydride show a single peak at 7 ppm? Because in maleic anhydride, the protons are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, no, maleic anhydride doesn't have any protons on the ring because it's fully conjugated. Wait, no, wait. Maleic anhydride structure: it's a five-membered ring with the structure O=C-(C-O)-C=O. The two carbonyl groups are conjugated with the oxygen. So the structure is actually O=C-O-C=C-O?

Wait, no, I think the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure is O=C-(CH2)-O-C=O, but that's not right. Wait, the correct structure of maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure where two carbonyl groups are connected by an oxygen. The actual structure is:

O
||
C-O-C=C-O
||   
O

Wait, no, perhaps it's a five-membered ring where two of the carbons are carbonyls. So the structure is O=C-O-C=C-O, but arranged in a ring. That makes more sense. So the two double bonds are part of the ring. Thus, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the double bonds.

So, in maleic anhydride, the 1H NMR would show some deshielded protons. Wait, but wait, in maleic anhydride, all the protons are in the alpha positions, but actually, in its structure, are there protons? Oh, wait, no! Maleic anhydride has no hydrogen atoms on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups because they are part of the double bond. So its 1H NMR would be quiet in certain regions. Wait, but the question says the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, that's confusing because I thought maleic anhydride doesn't have any protons on the ring. So perhaps the anhydride in the problem isn't maleic anhydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't fumaric acid but another diacid. Let me think. Maybe the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, which upon dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride like succinic anhydride. Succinic anhydride has two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls. So in its 1H NMR, those CH2 groups would appear around 4 ppm as quartets because of coupling with each other. But the question says the anhydride's 1H NMR has a peak at 7 ppm, which doesn't match that.

Hmm, maybe the anhydride isn't cyclic but acyclic. For example, if the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, which upon dehydration would form a straight-chain anhydride, but that would have protons in the CH2 groups. Then, the 1H NMR would show peaks in the 1-3 ppm range. But the question has a peak at 7 ppm, which is higher. So perhaps the anhydride is something else.

Wait, maybe the anhydride has a double bond elsewhere. For example, the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, which upon dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond. So the structure would be (HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH → dehydrated to form a cyclic anhydride with a double bond). So the anhydride would have a double bond, and perhaps the protons adjacent to the double bond would be deshielded, appearing around 5-7 ppm.

In that case, the 1H NMR would show a peak at 7 ppm, perhaps from a trans proton on the double bond. But wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene, so the diacid has a cis configuration. Dehydration would form an anhydride with a cis double bond. The protons on the double bond would then be cis, leading to a specific NMR pattern.

So, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That could be two equivalent protons on a double bond. For example, a trans double bond would have two distinct protons (as in trans-cis), but if the double bond is symmetric, perhaps the protons are equivalent, giving a single peak. Alternatively, if the structure is such that the two protons are in an identical environment, they would be a doublet or a triplet, but if they're equivalent, perhaps as a singlet.

Wait, no, in a double bond, each proton is attached to a carbon, and they're usually split into a doublet. But in a symmetric situation, the two protons are equivalent and would form a singlet. For example, in a symmetrical alkene like (CH3)2C=CH2, but no, that's not symmetric. Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CH(CO)2O, but that's not symmetric.

Alternatively, if the double bond is between two identical groups, the protons would be equivalent. For example, CH2=CH would be a trans double bond with two equivalent protons if the substituents are the same on each carbon.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure where the double bond is part of the ring. So the protons are in a conjugated system, leading to a shift upfield or downfield. For example, in a cyclic anhydride with a double bond, such as a bicyclic structure.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the anhydride's structure. Let me try to proceed, perhaps I can figure it out later.

So, the anhydride reacts with the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The products are two: major and minor. The major product's NOESY shows a cross-peak, implying that two protons are close in space. The minor product doesn't have this cross-peak, meaning those protons are not near each other there.

The options for the cross-peak are:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Looking for what these signals could be:

Option A: 6H singlet at 1 ppm is probably from six equivalent methyl groups, maybe attached to something like an oxygen or a branch. The 1.5 ppm doublet is perhaps a methyl group attached to a double bond or next to an electronegative atom.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm could be a set of methyl groups adjacent to a group that deshields them a bit. The 2H singlet at 3.5 is possibly two equivalent protons, maybe on an oxygen-substituted carbon, like an ether or ester.

Option C: Both are singlets, suggesting no splitting. 1 ppm is likely methyl groups attached to something that's not very deshielding, perhaps in a branched position. The 1.7 ppm could be from another set of methyl groups, perhaps near an oxygen.

Option D: The doublet at 1.5 ppm might be a proton adjacent to another proton, like in a CH2 group. The 2H singlet at 3.5 could be a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen.

Now, considering the Diels-Alder product, let's think about how the substituents from the anhydride are attached. The major product likely has the substituents in a position that allows for certain protons to be close in space.

The anhydride, when acting as a dienophile, would add to the diene in a way that the two carbonyl groups attach to the diene. The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with the substituents from the dienophile on carbons 1 and 4 of the cyclohexene.

In the case of the anhydride, the substituents would be the two carbonyl groups attached to the oxygen. So the product would have the carbonyl groups attached to the cyclohexene ring in a specific arrangement.

Now, considering the substituents from the diene (the tetramethyl cyclopentadiene), each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So the Diels-Alder adduct would incorporate these methyl groups into the bicyclic structure.

The major product, having the cross-peak in the NOESY, suggests that two protons are close. This would happen if, for example, a methyl group is transannularly close to another group in the ring. Alternatively, if two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, their protons might be close in space.

Looking at the options, the most likely candidates are options B and C, which have singlets, implying that the protons are in a symmetric environment. If the product has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, they would appear as singlets.

Wait, the major product's cross-peak connects two protons. So in the NOESY, which detects through-space proximity, these two protons must be on adjacent carbons or close in the ring structure. For example, if the product has a bridge or a bicyclic structure where two protons are on opposite ends but close in 3D space, their signals would cross in the NOESY.

If the cross-peak is between a 6H singlet and another group, that 6H singlet must be from multiple equivalent protons. For example, if there are three methyl groups each contributing two H, that's 6H. Alternatively, perhaps a single methyl group split into a singlet, but that doesn't fit the 6H.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H could be three methyl groups attached to the ring. The 2H singlet could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen, perhaps in the bridge position.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene part of the product. Since the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, the product would incorporate those methyl groups into the ring structure.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So when it reacts, forming a six-membered ring, the substituents (the methyl groups) would be on the adjacent carbons of the new ring. So the product would have four methyl groups from the diene and two substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride's carbonyls).

So, the product would have a bicyclic structure, perhaps with two substituents (the carbonyl groups) in the bridge.

In the major product, certain methyl groups might be positioned such that their protons are close in space, leading to a NOESY cross-peak. For example, if two methyl groups are on adjacent bridgeheads, their protons might be close, but that might not necessarily lead to a cross-peak unless they're close enough in 3D space.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents from the anhydride are on adjacent carbons, and their adjacent positions cause the protons to be close.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: 6H singlet at 1 ppm (maybe three methyl groups, each contributing 2H) and a 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm (perhaps a CH group). But why would a CH group be a doublet? Maybe it's next to another CH2 or something.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. The 3.5 ppm is higher, so perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe a CH2-O.

Option C: 6H at 1 and 6H at 1.7. Both are singlets, possibly from methyl groups in different environments. Maybe one set is near an electronegative atom and the other is more shielded.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 and 2H singlet at 3.5. The 1.5 could be a methylene next to a CH2, and the 3.5 a CH2-O or similar.

Now, considering the Diels-Alder adduct, the product would have substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The dienophile contributes two carbonyl groups, each connected to an oxygen bridge. The diene contributes four methyl groups.

In the major product, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the two carbonyl groups are on the same face (endo rule), leading to certain methyl groups being close in space. Alternatively, if the substituents are trans, the methyl groups might be on opposite sides, but this would affect the NOESY.

The cross-peak in NOESY suggests that two protons are close in space. So, perhaps in the major product, a methyl group is near another group, like a methylene adjacent to an oxygen.

Looking at the options, option B has a 2H singlet at 3.5. That could be a CH2 next to an oxygen (like an ether or ester group). The 6H singlet at 1.7 could be three methyl groups attached to the same carbon, which would be highly shielded if in a branch, but perhaps more deshielded if adjacent to something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is from three methyl groups attached to the same bridgehead, and the 2H is a bridge methylene group.

Wait, another approach: in the Diels-Alder product, the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be on the ring. If the minor product is formed from a different regiochemistry, perhaps the substituents are on different positions, but the major product is formed with the substituents in a position where certain protons are close.

If the major product has a bridge structure where a methyl group is close to another group (like another methyl group or a substituent), that would explain the cross-peak.

Let's think about the product structure. The Diels-Alder adduct of the anhydride (dienophile) and the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene) would form a bicyclo structure. The anhydride contributes two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen bridge. The diene contributes four methyl groups, so they would be attached to the cyclohexene ring.

In the major product, perhaps the substituents are arranged so that two methyl groups are on adjacent bridgeheads, causing their protons to be close. This would result in a cross-peak in the NOESY.

But the options don't directly correspond to that. Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups attached to a single carbon (like a tertiary carbon), and the 2H is from a methylene adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm is a good clue. Singlet suggests no neighboring protons, so it's probably a group like OCH2O or something where the CH2 is between two electronegative atoms, making it a singlet.

In the Diels-Alder product, the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride would become part of the six-membered ring as ketones or esters. Wait, no, the anhydride would contribute two ester groups or ketones, but in the Diels-Alder adduct, the carbonyls would be part of the ring as ketones or perhaps lactones, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder adduct forms a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, like norbornene. If the anhydride is a cyclic dienophile, the product could be a norbornene derivative with substituents.

In norbornene derivatives, the bridgehead positions are carbons 1 and 4. If those positions have substituents, their protons would be in specific regions.

In the norbornene structure, the bridgehead protons are typically deshielded and appear around 1.5-2 ppm. The exo protons (on the bridge) might appear around 3.5 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the 2H singlet at 3.5 is the bridgehead protons. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, they could be from an endo position.

If the major product has the substituents (like the carbonyl groups) in such a way that a methyl group is near a bridgehead, their protons would be near, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups attached to the same carbon. For example, if a carbon has three methyl substituents, each contributing two protons, that would give a 6H singlet.

In that case, another group nearby, such as a CH2O group, would have two protons that are a singlet. The 6H and 2H being close in space would show a cross-peak in NOESY.

Looking at option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. If the 6H is from a trimethyl group (like -C(CH3)3), and the 2H is from a CH2O, then those protons would be spatially close, especially if the -C(CH3)3 is adjacent to the CH2O group.

In the Diels-Alder product, perhaps the bridgehead has a -C(CH3)3 group, and the bridge has a CH2O group. The proximity in the bicyclic structure would cause the protons to be close, leading to a NOESY cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is from three methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons, and the 2H is from a methylene group in the bridge.

Wait, another angle: the NOESY cross-peak in the major product suggests that these two protons are near each other in 3D space. So, perhaps one is on a bridgehead and the other is on a substituent attached to the bridge.

For example, in norbornene, a bridgehead substituent and a substituent on the bridge might be close. So a methyl group on the bridgehead and a CH2O group on the bridge would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

So, the 6H singlet could be from three methyl groups on a bridgehead, and the 2H from a methylene in the bridge. That would make sense.

Now, looking at the options, option B has a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet, which fits this scenario.

Alternatively, option C has two sets of 6H singlets, perhaps from two separate trimethyl groups, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a cross-peak.

Option D's doublet and singlet might not be close enough unless the doublet is adjacent to the singlet, but the 1.5 ppm is a doublet, which implies coupling with one neighboring proton, perhaps a CH2.

In summary, considering the options and the scenario, option B seems to fit best. The 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm could be from a trimethyl group (like -C(CH3)3) attached to a bridgehead, and the 2H singlet at 3.5 could be from a CH2O group in the bridge. The proximity in the bicyclic structure would cause these protons to be close, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major and a minor product. Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product exhibits a cross-peak in its 2D NOESY NMR spectrum, indicating spatial proximity between two protons, while the minor product does not.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Anhydride Structure**: The anhydride is formed from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, likely corresponding to protons on a double bond, and its 13C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (likely a carbon in the double bond) and 165 ppm (likely a carbonyl carbon). This suggests the anhydride is likely a cyclic structure with a double bond.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**: The anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. The reaction forms a bicyclic product with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The major product likely follows the endo rule, where substituents are positioned closer to the diene's bulky groups.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**: The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum indicates spatial proximity between two protons. This suggests a specific arrangement of substituents in the bicyclic structure.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. The 6H singlet could correspond to methyl groups, but the 1H doublet does not align well with the expected structure or proximity.
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet likely corresponds to three methyl groups (e.g., -C(CH3)3) attached to a bridgehead, while the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could correspond to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. These groups are spatially close in the bicyclic structure, making this option plausible.
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. Both singlets suggest multiple methyl groups, but they do not align with the expected spatial proximity for a cross-peak.
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The doublet suggests coupling with a neighboring proton, but this arrangement does not fit the expected proximity in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm corresponds to three methyl groups on a bridgehead, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm corresponds to a CH2 group in the bridge. These groups are spatially close in the bicyclic structure, leading to the observed NOESY cross-peak in the major product.

**Answer: B**
