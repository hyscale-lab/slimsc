Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step.

So the setup is this: There's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system also changes. Because the energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the dot product of mu and B. So the Hamiltonian would be proportional to the component of the magnetic moment along the field direction.

Initially, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is something like H_initial = -mu·B = -gamma Sz B. But since the field is turned off, that initial Hamiltonian probably becomes zero because the field is no longer present? Or wait, no—maybe I should model this differently. Oh, wait, the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y. So the initial state is when the field is along Z, and then suddenly the field is changed to Y.

Wait, but how does that affect the system? When the Hamiltonian changes, it's a time-dependent problem. But perhaps I should think about the time evolution after the change.

Wait, no, maybe the spin state is initially an eigenstate of the original Hamiltonian, and then when the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian, then the Hamiltonian changes. So the initial state is a spin-up state along Z, perhaps. But then, the new Hamiltonian is along Y.

Hmm. Let's model this. Spin-1/2 particles have spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B is H = -mu · B.

Initially, B is in +Z, so H_initial = -gamma Sz B. The eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies -gamma B (1/2) and gamma B (1/2), since Sz has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Wait, no, actually, for spin-1/2, Sz has eigenvalues ± (ℏ/2) * something? Wait, no, actually, for spin 1/2, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So Sz has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So maybe H_initial is H = -mu · B = -gamma B (Sz). So the energies are -gamma B (Sz) which would be -gamma B (ħ/2) and +gamma B (ħ/2) for the two states. Wait, but usually, for the Zeeman Hamiltonian, it's H = - mu·B. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as H = - gamma B Sz. So the energy levels are proportional to Sz.

Wait, but the actual expressions depend on the conventions. Let me just proceed.

The initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, say |+z>, which has energy E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2). But when the magnetic field is suddenly turned off in Z direction and turned on in Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -gamma Sy B (since B is now along Y). Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the field is along Y, so the component is Sy.

So after the change, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Now, Sy is a spin operator, so the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± (ℏ/2) for Sy.

But the initial state, |+z>, is not an eigenstate of H_new. So the state will evolve over time under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation, so the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, but we need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz(t)>. Because the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

So the average <mu_z> would be gamma times the expectation value of Sz in the state |ψ(t)>.

So let's compute this. Let me write down the steps:

1. Express the initial state |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H_new.

H_new has eigenstates |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+y and E_-y. So |+z> can be written as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

2. Find the expansion coefficients.

The eigenstates of Sy can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sz. The |+y> state is ( |+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2), and the |-y> state is ( |+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2), I think. Wait, no, actually, the eigenstates of Sy are combinations of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, the standard expressions are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Is that correct? Let me double-check. The eigenstates of Sy are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) for +y and (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) for -y, assuming they're normalized correctly.

Yes, that seems right. So |+z> can be expressed as:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Similarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

So, the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

3. Time evolution under H_new.

H_new is given by H = - gamma B Sy.

Wait, Sy has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2) * gamma B? Wait no, because H_new = - gamma B Sy. So for |+y>, Sy is (ħ/2) * sigma_y operator, whose eigenvalue is (ħ/2) for |+y>.

Wait, actually, let me correct this. The spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2). So when multiplied by -gamma B, the energies become E = -gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which would be E_+y = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_-y = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, no: H_new is - gamma B Sy. So for |+y>, Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>. So H_new |+y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> = E_+y |+y>, where E_+y = - (gamma B ħ/2).

Similarly, for |-y>, H_new |−y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |−y>.

So the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H_new t / ħ )

So for each state |+y> and |-y>, the time evolution is:

|+y> → exp( -i ( E_+y ) t / ħ ) |+y>
Similarly for |-y>.

But E_+y is - gamma B (ħ/2) So E_+y= - (gamma B ħ/2 )

Therefore, the exponential factor is exp( -i [ (- gamma B ħ/2 ) * t ] / ħ ) 

Simplify: exp( i ( gamma B t / 2 ) )

Similarly for |-y>, E_-y= gamma B ( ħ/2 )

Exponential becomes exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2 t) / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

4. Expressing the state after time t.

The initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Time evolution:

|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = (U(t) |+y> + U(t) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Which is:

( exp( i gamma B t /2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t /2 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

5. Now find <Sz(t)>. 

Since mu_z = gamma <Sz>, so the expectation value is gamma times <Sz(t)>.

So <Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>

Because Sz is an operator, we need to compute this expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find <Sz> in the state |ψ(t)>, then multiply by gamma.

But let's compute <Sz(t)>. Let me find the expression for Sz in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, Sz is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

But perhaps using the basis |+y> and |-y> would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express Sz in terms of |+y> and |-y> states.

Alternatively, express |ψ(t)> in the z basis and compute the expectation value.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz(t)> as follows:

Express |ψ(t)> in the z basis.

Wait, |+y> and |-y> are combinations of |+z> and |-z>, so perhaps it's easier to write |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

First, write |ψ(t)> = [ exp(i omega t) |+y> + exp( -i omega t ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2)

Where omega is gamma B / 2.

Now, express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

Substituting into ψ(t):

ψ(t) = [ exp(i omega t) (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + exp(−i omega t) (|+z> − |−z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator:

= [ exp(i omega t) |+z> + exp(i omega t)|−z> + exp(-i omega t) |+z> - exp(-i omega t) |−z> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )

Wait, denominator is sqrt(2) from the first substitution, and another sqrt(2) from the initial normalization, so overall denominator is 2.

So, grouping terms:

= [ (exp(i omega t) + exp(-i omega t)) |+z> + (exp(i omega t) - exp(-i omega t)) |−z> ] / 2

Now, using Euler's formula, exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ, and exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ.

So,

= [ 2 cos(omega t) |+z> + 2i sin(omega t) |−z> ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z>

So, the state |ψ(t)> is cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z>

Now, compute <Sz(t)>. Remember that Sz |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and Sz |−z> = -(ħ/2) |−z>.

So, <Sz(t)> = [ cos(omega t) < +z | + i sin(omega t) < -z | ] Sz [ cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z> ]

Multiply it out:

= cos(omega t) cos(omega t) < +z | Sz | +z > + cos(omega t) i sin(omega t) < +z | Sz | −z> 
+ i sin(omega t) cos(omega t) < -z | Sz | +z > + i sin(omega t) i sin(omega t) < -z | Sz | -z >

Compute each term:

< +z | Sz | +z > = ħ/2

< +z | Sz | -z > = 0 (since Sz | -z > is -(ħ/2)|-z>, and < +z | -z> is zero.

Similarly, < -z | Sz | +z > = 0.

< -z | Sz | -z > = - ħ/2

So:

= cos²(omega t) * (ħ/2) + i^2 sin²(omega t) ( - ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= ( ħ/2 ) [ cos²(omega t) - ( -1 ) sin²(omega t) ]

Wait, wait, correction. Let me recompute the last term:

The fourth term is (i sin(omega t))^2 < -z | Sz | -z > = (i^2 sin²(omega t)) (-ħ/2) ) = (-1) sin²(omega t) (-ħ/2) = (ħ/2) sin²(omega t).

Wait, let's recalculate each term:

Term 1: cos^2(omega t) (ħ/2)
Term 2: i cos(omega t) sin(omega t) * 0 = 0
Term 3: i sin(omega t) cos(omega t) * 0 = 0
Term 4: (i sin(omega t))^2 (-ħ/2) = (i^2) sin^2(omega t) (-ħ/2) )= (-1) sin^2(omega t) (-ħ/2) = (ħ/2) sin^2(omega t)

So, total <Sz(t)> = [ (ħ/2) cos^2(omega t) ] + [ (ħ/2) sin^2(omega t) ) ]

Which is (ħ/2)( cos^2 + sin^2 ) = ħ/2 (1) = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the expectation value of Sz is ħ/2, then the average mu_z is gamma times that, which would be (gamma ħ/2 ) / ħ? Wait, no. Wait, what's the unit here? Maybe I messed up the units.

Wait, no, the initial state was |+z>, which has Sz = ħ/2. Then under time evolution, the expectation value remains the same? That can't be right, because the question says the average starts oscillating.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in substituting the states. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, after time evolution, the state is:

|ψ(t)> = cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z>

Then, <Sz> is [ cos(omega t) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [ i sin(omega t) ]^2 (-ħ/2 )

Wait, because <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> is |a|^2 < +z | Sz | +z > + |b|^2 < -z | Sz | -z > + cross terms.

Wait, perhaps I should compute <Sz> as (a a* < +z | Sz | +z > + a b* < +z | Sz | -z > + b a* < -z | Sz | +z > + b b* < -z | Sz | -z > )

Where a = cos(omega t), b= i sin(omega t).

So,

a a* = cos^2(omega t)
a b* = cos(omega t) (-i sin(omega t) )
b a* = i sin(omega t) cos(omega t)
b b* = (i sin(omega t)) ( -i sin(omega t) ) = (i * -i) sin^2(omega t) ) = (1) sin^2(omega t)

So,

< Sz > = [ a a* (ħ/2) ] + [ a b* * 0 ] + [ b a* * 0 ] + [ b b* (- ħ/2) ]

So,

= (ħ/2) cos^2(omega t) + ( - ħ/2 ) ( sin^2(omega t) )

Because b b* is sin^2(omega t) and the term is multiplied by (-ħ/2).

Wait, no. Because a b* is cos(omega t) * (-i sin(omega t)), and when multiplied by < +z | Sz | -z >, which is zero, those cross terms vanish.

So,

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos^2(omega t) + (- ħ/2) sin^2(omega t )

= ħ/2 ( cos^2(omega t) - sin^2(omega t) )

= (ħ/2) cos(2 omega t )

Ah, there we go. So the expectation value oscillates with frequency 2 omega.

Wait, because cos(2 omega t) has frequency 2 omega.

But what is omega? Earlier, I defined omega as gamma B / 2.

So, 2 omega = gamma B.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

But the average mu_z is gamma times <Sz>, because mu_z = gamma <Sz>

So,

< mu_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. The standard expression for spin in magnetic field has energy proportional to gamma B S, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, the spin matrices are in units of ħ/2. So S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so mu_z = gamma S_z has eigenvalues ± gamma ħ/2.

But in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z. So mu_z has eigenvalues ± (gamma ħ/2 )

Wait, but in the calculation, <Sz> is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so <mu_z> would be gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of the cosine term. Because the average is oscillating as cos(omega t), the frequency is omega.

In our case, the cosine term is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, let me check. Let me think again.

Wait, <Sz> is (ħ/2) cos(2 omega t ), because earlier expression was (ħ/2) cos(2 omega t ), with omega = gamma B/2.

So 2 omega = gamma B.

So <Sz> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Then, <mu_z> = gamma * <Sz> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but this seems to be a time-dependent expectation value. So the average mu_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, wait—what's the actual oscillation? The function cos( gamma B t ) oscillates at frequency gamma B / (2 pi), but the angular frequency is gamma B.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency. So yes, the frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer would be option B: gamma*B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the energy difference between the eigenstates is E_+y - E_-y = (-gamma B ( ħ/2 )) - (gamma B ( ħ/2 )) ) = -gamma B ħ.

The energy difference is delta E = -gamma B ħ - gamma B ħ = -2 gamma B ħ. Wait, the energy levels are E_+y = -(gamma B ħ/2 ), E_-y = (gamma B ħ/2 )

So the energy difference is E_-y - E_+y = gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency between these states is (delta E)/ ħ = gamma B.

Hence, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the average oscillates at frequency gamma B, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle subjected to a changing magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment aligns with this field. The Hamiltonian in this case is proportional to \( H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z \), where \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are \( |+z\rangle \) and \( |-z\rangle \), corresponding to spin-up and spin-down along the +Z direction.

When the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and reoriented along the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes \( H_{\text{new}} = -\gamma B S_y \). The eigenstates of \( S_y \) are \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \), which are superpositions of \( |+z\rangle \) and \( |-z\rangle \):  
\[
|+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle).
\]

The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) is not an eigenstate of \( H_{\text{new}} \), so the state evolves over time under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation, and the state at time \( t \) is:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-iH_{\text{new}}t/\hbar} |+z\rangle.
\]

Substituting \( H_{\text{new}} = -\gamma B S_y \), the eigenstates \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \) evolve with time-dependent phases:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\omega t} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\omega t} |-y\rangle \right),
\]
where \( \omega = \gamma B / 2 \).

The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, \( \mu_z = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle \), is determined by the expectation value of \( S_z \) in the state \( |\psi(t)\rangle \). Expressing \( |\psi(t)\rangle \) in the \( |+z\rangle \), \( |-z\rangle \) basis, we find:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\omega t)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\omega t)|-z\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( S_z \) is:
\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\omega t)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\omega t)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2}\cos(2\omega t).
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \mu_z \) is:
\[
\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2}\cos(2\omega t).
\]

The oscillation frequency of \( \langle \mu_z \rangle \) is determined by the argument of the cosine term, \( 2\omega \). Substituting \( \omega = \gamma B / 2 \), the frequency is:
\[
\text{Frequency} = 2\omega = \gamma B.
\]

Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is \( \gamma B \).

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step.

So the setup is this: There's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system also changes. Because the energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the dot product of mu and B. So the Hamiltonian would be proportional to the component of the magnetic moment along the field direction.

Initially, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is something like H_initial = -mu·B = -gamma Sz B. But since the field is turned off, that initial Hamiltonian probably becomes zero because the field is no longer present? Or wait, no—maybe I should model this differently. Oh, wait, the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y. So the initial state is when the field is along Z, and then suddenly the field is changed to Y.

Wait, but how does that affect the system? When the Hamiltonian changes, it's a time-dependent problem. But perhaps I should think about the time evolution after the change.

Wait, no, maybe the spin state is initially an eigenstate of the original Hamiltonian, and then when the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously, but the time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian, then the Hamiltonian changes. So the initial state is a spin-up state along Z, perhaps. But then, the new Hamiltonian is along Y.

Hmm. Let's model this. Spin-1/2 particles have spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B is H = -mu · B.

Initially, B is in +Z, so H_initial = -gamma Sz B. The eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies -gamma B (1/2) and gamma B (1/2), since Sz has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Wait, no, actually, for spin-1/2, Sz has eigenvalues ± (ℏ/2) * something? Wait, no, actually, for spin 1/2, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So Sz has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So maybe H_initial is H = -mu · B = -gamma B (Sz). So the energies are -gamma B (Sz) which would be -gamma B (ħ/2) and +gamma B (ħ/2) for the two states. Wait, but usually, for the Zeeman Hamiltonian, it's H = - mu·B. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as H = - gamma B Sz. So the energy levels are proportional to Sz.

Wait, but the actual expressions depend on the conventions. Let me just proceed.

The initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, say |+z>, which has energy E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2). But when the magnetic field is suddenly turned off in Z direction and turned on in Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_new = -gamma Sy B (since B is now along Y). Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the field is along Y, so the component is Sy.

So after the change, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Now, Sy is a spin operator, so the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± (ℏ/2) for Sy.

But the initial state, |+z>, is not an eigenstate of H_new. So the state will evolve over time under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation, so the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H_new t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, but we need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz(t)>. Because the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

So the average <mu_z> would be gamma times the expectation value of Sz in the state |ψ(t)>.

So let's compute this. Let me write down the steps:

1. Express the initial state |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H_new.

H_new has eigenstates |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+y and E_-y. So |+z> can be written as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>.

2. Find the expansion coefficients.

The eigenstates of Sy can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of Sz. The |+y> state is ( |+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2), and the |-y> state is ( |+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2), I think. Wait, no, actually, the eigenstates of Sy are combinations of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, the standard expressions are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Is that correct? Let me double-check. The eigenstates of Sy are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) for +y and (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) for -y, assuming they're normalized correctly.

Yes, that seems right. So |+z> can be expressed as:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Similarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

So, the initial state |+z> is (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

3. Time evolution under H_new.

H_new is given by H = - gamma B Sy.

Wait, Sy has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2) * gamma B? Wait no, because H_new = - gamma B Sy. So for |+y>, Sy is (ħ/2) * sigma_y operator, whose eigenvalue is (ħ/2) for |+y>.

Wait, actually, let me correct this. The spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2). So when multiplied by -gamma B, the energies become E = -gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which would be E_+y = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_-y = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, no: H_new is - gamma B Sy. So for |+y>, Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>. So H_new |+y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> = E_+y |+y>, where E_+y = - (gamma B ħ/2).

Similarly, for |-y>, H_new |−y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |−y>.

So the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H_new t / ħ )

So for each state |+y> and |-y>, the time evolution is:

|+y> → exp( -i ( E_+y ) t / ħ ) |+y>
Similarly for |-y>.

But E_+y is - gamma B (ħ/2) So E_+y= - (gamma B ħ/2 )

Therefore, the exponential factor is exp( -i [ (- gamma B ħ/2 ) * t ] / ħ ) 

Simplify: exp( i ( gamma B t / 2 ) )

Similarly for |-y>, E_-y= gamma B ( ħ/2 )

Exponential becomes exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2 t) / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

4. Expressing the state after time t.

The initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Time evolution:

|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = (U(t) |+y> + U(t) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Which is:

( exp( i gamma B t /2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t /2 ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

5. Now find <Sz(t)>. 

Since mu_z = gamma <Sz>, so the expectation value is gamma times <Sz(t)>.

So <Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>

Because Sz is an operator, we need to compute this expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find <Sz> in the state |ψ(t)>, then multiply by gamma.

But let's compute <Sz(t)>. Let me find the expression for Sz in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, Sz is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

But perhaps using the basis |+y> and |-y> would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express Sz in terms of |+y> and |-y> states.

Alternatively, express |ψ(t)> in the z basis and compute the expectation value.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz(t)> as follows:

Express |ψ(t)> in the z basis.

Wait, |+y> and |-y> are combinations of |+z> and |-z>, so perhaps it's easier to write |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

First, write |ψ(t)> = [ exp(i omega t) |+y> + exp( -i omega t ) |−y> ] / sqrt(2)

Where omega is gamma B / 2.

Now, express |+y> and |−y> in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2)
|−y> = (|+z> − |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

Substituting into ψ(t):

ψ(t) = [ exp(i omega t) (|+z> + |−z>)/sqrt(2) + exp(−i omega t) (|+z> − |−z> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator:

= [ exp(i omega t) |+z> + exp(i omega t)|−z> + exp(-i omega t) |+z> - exp(-i omega t) |−z> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )

Wait, denominator is sqrt(2) from the first substitution, and another sqrt(2) from the initial normalization, so overall denominator is 2.

So, grouping terms:

= [ (exp(i omega t) + exp(-i omega t)) |+z> + (exp(i omega t) - exp(-i omega t)) |−z> ] / 2

Now, using Euler's formula, exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ, and exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ) = 2i sinθ.

So,

= [ 2 cos(omega t) |+z> + 2i sin(omega t) |−z> ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z>

So, the state |ψ(t)> is cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z>

Now, compute <Sz(t)>. Remember that Sz |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and Sz |−z> = -(ħ/2) |−z>.

So, <Sz(t)> = [ cos(omega t) < +z | + i sin(omega t) < -z | ] Sz [ cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z> ]

Multiply it out:

= cos(omega t) cos(omega t) < +z | Sz | +z > + cos(omega t) i sin(omega t) < +z | Sz | −z> 
+ i sin(omega t) cos(omega t) < -z | Sz | +z > + i sin(omega t) i sin(omega t) < -z | Sz | -z >

Compute each term:

< +z | Sz | +z > = ħ/2

< +z | Sz | -z > = 0 (since Sz | -z > is -(ħ/2)|-z>, and < +z | -z> is zero.

Similarly, < -z | Sz | +z > = 0.

< -z | Sz | -z > = - ħ/2

So:

= cos²(omega t) * (ħ/2) + i^2 sin²(omega t) ( - ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= ( ħ/2 ) [ cos²(omega t) - ( -1 ) sin²(omega t) ]

Wait, wait, correction. Let me recompute the last term:

The fourth term is (i sin(omega t))^2 < -z | Sz | -z > = (i^2 sin²(omega t)) (-ħ/2) ) = (-1) sin²(omega t) (-ħ/2) = (ħ/2) sin²(omega t).

Wait, let's recalculate each term:

Term 1: cos^2(omega t) (ħ/2)
Term 2: i cos(omega t) sin(omega t) * 0 = 0
Term 3: i sin(omega t) cos(omega t) * 0 = 0
Term 4: (i sin(omega t))^2 (-ħ/2) = (i^2) sin^2(omega t) (-ħ/2) )= (-1) sin^2(omega t) (-ħ/2) = (ħ/2) sin^2(omega t)

So, total <Sz(t)> = [ (ħ/2) cos^2(omega t) ] + [ (ħ/2) sin^2(omega t) ) ]

Which is (ħ/2)( cos^2 + sin^2 ) = ħ/2 (1) = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the expectation value of Sz is ħ/2, then the average mu_z is gamma times that, which would be (gamma ħ/2 ) / ħ? Wait, no. Wait, what's the unit here? Maybe I messed up the units.

Wait, no, the initial state was |+z>, which has Sz = ħ/2. Then under time evolution, the expectation value remains the same? That can't be right, because the question says the average starts oscillating.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in substituting the states. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, after time evolution, the state is:

|ψ(t)> = cos(omega t) |+z> + i sin(omega t) |−z>

Then, <Sz> is [ cos(omega t) ]^2 (ħ/2) + [ i sin(omega t) ]^2 (-ħ/2 )

Wait, because <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> is |a|^2 < +z | Sz | +z > + |b|^2 < -z | Sz | -z > + cross terms.

Wait, perhaps I should compute <Sz> as (a a* < +z | Sz | +z > + a b* < +z | Sz | -z > + b a* < -z | Sz | +z > + b b* < -z | Sz | -z > )

Where a = cos(omega t), b= i sin(omega t).

So,

a a* = cos^2(omega t)
a b* = cos(omega t) (-i sin(omega t) )
b a* = i sin(omega t) cos(omega t)
b b* = (i sin(omega t)) ( -i sin(omega t) ) = (i * -i) sin^2(omega t) ) = (1) sin^2(omega t)

So,

< Sz > = [ a a* (ħ/2) ] + [ a b* * 0 ] + [ b a* * 0 ] + [ b b* (- ħ/2) ]

So,

= (ħ/2) cos^2(omega t) + ( - ħ/2 ) ( sin^2(omega t) )

Because b b* is sin^2(omega t) and the term is multiplied by (-ħ/2).

Wait, no. Because a b* is cos(omega t) * (-i sin(omega t)), and when multiplied by < +z | Sz | -z >, which is zero, those cross terms vanish.

So,

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos^2(omega t) + (- ħ/2) sin^2(omega t )

= ħ/2 ( cos^2(omega t) - sin^2(omega t) )

= (ħ/2) cos(2 omega t )

Ah, there we go. So the expectation value oscillates with frequency 2 omega.

Wait, because cos(2 omega t) has frequency 2 omega.

But what is omega? Earlier, I defined omega as gamma B / 2.

So, 2 omega = gamma B.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

But the average mu_z is gamma times <Sz>, because mu_z = gamma <Sz>

So,

< mu_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. The standard expression for spin in magnetic field has energy proportional to gamma B S, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, the spin matrices are in units of ħ/2. So S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so mu_z = gamma S_z has eigenvalues ± gamma ħ/2.

But in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z. So mu_z has eigenvalues ± (gamma ħ/2 )

Wait, but in the calculation, <Sz> is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so <mu_z> would be gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of the cosine term. Because the average is oscillating as cos(omega t), the frequency is omega.

In our case, the cosine term is cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, let me check. Let me think again.

Wait, <Sz> is (ħ/2) cos(2 omega t ), because earlier expression was (ħ/2) cos(2 omega t ), with omega = gamma B/2.

So 2 omega = gamma B.

So <Sz> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Then, <mu_z> = gamma * <Sz> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but this seems to be a time-dependent expectation value. So the average mu_z oscillates with angular frequency gamma B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, wait—what's the actual oscillation? The function cos( gamma B t ) oscillates at frequency gamma B / (2 pi), but the angular frequency is gamma B.

But the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency. So yes, the frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer would be option B: gamma*B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the energy difference between the eigenstates is E_+y - E_-y = (-gamma B ( ħ/2 )) - (gamma B ( ħ/2 )) ) = -gamma B ħ.

The energy difference is delta E = -gamma B ħ - gamma B ħ = -2 gamma B ħ. Wait, the energy levels are E_+y = -(gamma B ħ/2 ), E_-y = (gamma B ħ/2 )

So the energy difference is E_-y - E_+y = gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency between these states is (delta E)/ ħ = gamma B.

Hence, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the average oscillates at frequency gamma B, which is option B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle subjected to a changing magnetic field. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment aligns with this field. The Hamiltonian in this case is proportional to \( H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z \), where \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are \( |+z\rangle \) and \( |-z\rangle \), corresponding to spin-up and spin-down along the +Z direction.

When the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and reoriented along the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes \( H_{\text{new}} = -\gamma B S_y \). The eigenstates of \( S_y \) are \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \), which are superpositions of \( |+z\rangle \) and \( |-z\rangle \):  
\[
|+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle).
\]

The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) is not an eigenstate of \( H_{\text{new}} \), so the state evolves over time under the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation, and the state at time \( t \) is:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-iH_{\text{new}}t/\hbar} |+z\rangle.
\]

Substituting \( H_{\text{new}} = -\gamma B S_y \), the eigenstates \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \) evolve with time-dependent phases:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\omega t} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\omega t} |-y\rangle \right),
\]
where \( \omega = \gamma B / 2 \).

The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, \( \mu_z = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle \), is determined by the expectation value of \( S_z \) in the state \( |\psi(t)\rangle \). Expressing \( |\psi(t)\rangle \) in the \( |+z\rangle \), \( |-z\rangle \) basis, we find:
\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\omega t)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\omega t)|-z\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( S_z \) is:
\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\omega t)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\omega t)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2}\cos(2\omega t).
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \mu_z \) is:
\[
\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2}\cos(2\omega t).
\]

The oscillation frequency of \( \langle \mu_z \rangle \) is determined by the argument of the cosine term, \( 2\omega \). Substituting \( \omega = \gamma B / 2 \), the frequency is:
\[
\text{Frequency} = 2\omega = \gamma B.
\]

Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is \( \gamma B \).
