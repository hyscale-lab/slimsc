Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about two electrons in p orbitals. I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number n=2, but wait, no, wait—in p orbitals, the angular momentum quantum number l is 1, right? Because s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, etc. So each electron has l=1.

The problem states that the coupled angular momentum state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm. So, I think the first two numbers are l1 and l2, which are both 1. The next is L, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is 2, and m is -1. So that state is a specific combination of the two electrons' orbital angular momenta.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. They're asking for the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each L1z and L2z would be -ħ. Wait, but orbital angular momentum eigenvalues are mħ, so for each electron, m can be -l, ..., +l. Since l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the state is given for the total angular momentum, not the individual electrons. So I need to figure out what the possible states are for each electron that would combine into the given state.

I think I remember that when combining angular momenta, you can express the combined state as a sum of product states. Each product state is a state where each electron has a certain m value, and their sum gives the total m. So for two electrons, each with l=1, the possible total L can be 0,1,2. But in this case, L is 2, so the maximum possible value.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. So the total m is -1. So when you expand this state into the product basis (i.e., the uncoupled basis where each electron's m is known), you'll get a combination of all possible pairs of m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum. So we're only dealing with the orbital angular momentum here.

So each electron's m can be -1, 0, +1. The total m is m1 + m2. Since the state is |m=-1>, any product state in the expansion must have m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question is about the probability of finding both electrons in their m=-1 states, so m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because if each L1z and L2z are measured, their eigenvalues would be -ħ each, which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1.

Wait, but the total m is m1 + m2. In the given state, the total m is -1. So for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, their sum would be -2, which is not equal to -1. So that product state (m1=-1, m2=-1) would not be part of the |L=2, m=-1> state. Therefore, the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> would be expanded into a combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So the product states would include:

m1=-1, m2=0 → sum to -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum to -1.

Are those the only possibilities? Because for L=2, when combining two l=1 states, the states are symmetric in a certain way.

Wait, the expansion for L=2 and M=-1 would have terms where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1) → wait, no, because m can't be outside the range of -l to +l. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1, same for m2.

So for sum m1 + m2 = -1, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1 → m2 = 0.

m1 = 0 → m2 = -1.

m1 = +1 → m2 = -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l=1. So only the first two possibilities contribute.

So the state |L=2, M=-1> is a combination of the product states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how about the coefficients? The expansion is symmetric, right? Let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For two l=1 states, the coupling to L=2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states are as follows. The state |L=2, M=-2> would be |m1=-1, m2=-1>. Similarly, |L=2, M=-1> would be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, yes. The expansion for |L=2, M=-1> is sqrt(1/2) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Because, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M are:

For M=2: [1,0,0,...] → |m1=1, m2=1>.

For M=1: sqrt(2/3) |m1=1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3)|m1=0, m2=1>.

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check. Alternatively, for M= -1, it's symmetric, so the expansion would involve |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, with equal coefficients.

Wait, the general formula for the expansion when L = l1 + l2 is such that the coefficient is sqrt( (2L +1) ( (l1 + l2 - M) (l1 - M + l2) ) ) / ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) )) ?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting into trouble here. Let me think alternatively. The state |L=2, M=-1> can be written as a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible combinations are m1 = -1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state should be a combination of these two. Also, because of symmetry, both terms should have the same coefficient.

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Because when you square the coefficients, each term contributes 1/2, and together they sum to 1.

So the possible product states in the expansion are those two.

Now, the question is asking about the joint probability of both electrons being in m=-1. That would be the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1>, right?

But wait, the sum here is m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is M=-2, but the given state has M=-1. So this product state isn't part of the expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the |L=2, M=-1> state is zero.

So the probability of measuring both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Is there any other way that the state could have a component where both m1 and m2 are -1?

No, because when L=2 and M=-1, the only possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1), as their sum is -1. So the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is in a different coupled state (L=2, M=-2), which is orthogonal to the given state.

Therefore, the probability is zero. So the answer must be D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l = 2 \) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total \( z \)-component of angular momentum.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the \( z \)-components of the orbital angular momentum \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) and obtaining eigenvalues of \( -\hbar \) for both electrons. This corresponds to finding the system in the product state \( |m_1, m_2\rangle = |-1, -1\rangle \), where \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

To analyze this, the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) must be expanded into the product basis of individual \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) states. The total \( m \)-value of the system is \( m = m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), so only product states where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) contribute to the expansion. The possible pairs of \( (m_1, m_2) \) are:

- \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \),
- \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \).

The product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \), as its sum is \( -2 \), which corresponds to a different coupled state \( |1,1,2,-2\rangle \). Therefore, the state \( |-1, -1\rangle \) does not appear in the expansion of \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), and its coefficient in this expansion is zero.

Since the coefficient of \( |-1, -1\rangle \) is zero, the probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is also zero.

Thus, the joint probability of obtaining \( -\hbar \) for both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) is:

So, each L1z and L2z would be -ħ. Wait, but orbital angular momentum eigenvalues are mħ, so for each electron, m can be -l, ..., +l. Since l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the state is given for the total angular momentum, not the individual electrons. So I need to figure out what the possible states are for each electron that would combine into the given state.

I think I remember that when combining angular momenta, you can express the combined state as a sum of product states. Each product state is a state where each electron has a certain m value, and their sum gives the total m. So for two electrons, each with l=1, the possible total L can be 0,1,2. But in this case, L is 2, so the maximum possible value.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. So the total m is -1. So when you expand this state into the product basis (i.e., the uncoupled basis where each electron's m is known), you'll get a combination of all possible pairs of m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum. So we're only dealing with the orbital angular momentum here.

So each electron's m can be -1, 0, +1. The total m is m1 + m2. Since the state is |m=-1>, any product state in the expansion must have m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question is about the probability of finding both electrons in their m=-1 states, so m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because if each L1z and L2z are measured, their eigenvalues would be -ħ each, which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1.

Wait, but the total m is m1 + m2. In the given state, the total m is -1. So for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, their sum would be -2, which is not equal to -1. So that product state (m1=-1, m2=-1) would not be part of the |L=2, m=-1> state. Therefore, the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> would be expanded into a combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So the product states would include:

m1=-1, m2=0 → sum to -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum to -1.

Are those the only possibilities? Because for L=2, when combining two l=1 states, the states are symmetric in a certain way.

Wait, the expansion for L=2 and M=-1 would have terms where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1) → wait, no, because m can't be outside the range of -l to +l. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1, same for m2.

So for sum m1 + m2 = -1, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1 → m2 = 0.

m1 = 0 → m2 = -1.

m1 = +1 → m2 = -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l=1. So only the first two possibilities contribute.

So the state |L=2, M=-1> is a combination of the product states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how about the coefficients? The expansion is symmetric, right? Let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For two l=1 states, the coupling to L=2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states are as follows. The state |L=2, M=-2> would be |m1=-1, m2=-1>. Similarly, |L=2, M=-1> would be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, yes. The expansion for |L=2, M=-1> is sqrt(1/2) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Because, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M are:

For M=2: [1,0,0,...] → |m1=1, m2=1>.

For M=1: sqrt(2/3) |m1=1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3)|m1=0, m2=1>.

Wait, no, perhaps I should double-check. Alternatively, for M= -1, it's symmetric, so the expansion would involve |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, with equal coefficients.

Wait, the general formula for the expansion when L = l1 + l2 is such that the coefficient is sqrt( (2L +1) ( (l1 + l2 - M) (l1 - M + l2) ) ) / ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) )) ?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting into trouble here. Let me think alternatively. The state |L=2, M=-1> can be written as a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The possible combinations are m1 = -1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state should be a combination of these two. Also, because of symmetry, both terms should have the same coefficient.

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Because when you square the coefficients, each term contributes 1/2, and together they sum to 1.

So the possible product states in the expansion are those two.

Now, the question is asking about the joint probability of both electrons being in m=-1. That would be the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1>, right?

But wait, the sum here is m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is M=-2, but the given state has M=-1. So this product state isn't part of the expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the |L=2, M=-1> state is zero.

So the probability of measuring both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Is there any other way that the state could have a component where both m1 and m2 are -1?

No, because when L=2 and M=-1, the only possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1), as their sum is -1. So the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is in a different coupled state (L=2, M=-2), which is orthogonal to the given state.

Therefore, the probability is zero. So the answer must be D) 0.
