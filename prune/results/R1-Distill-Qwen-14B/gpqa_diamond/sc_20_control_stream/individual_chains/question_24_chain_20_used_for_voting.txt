Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully and try to break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Z is part of mixture Y and is a common solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably saturated.

Moreover, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So, whatever X is, its components don't have conjugated double bonds, like maybe isolated double bonds or maybe just single bonds.

Hmm. So, let me think about what mixture X could be. Since X decolorizes bromine water, that suggests it has double bonds because bromine adds across double bonds, causing the solution to decolorize. Wait, but wait, if X is a mixture of two liquids, each of which can decolorize bromine, they must have some unsaturated bonds.

But wait, mixture Y from X doesn't decolorize bromine. So, perhaps the reaction involves hydrogenation. Oh, because the reaction uses platinum and heat, which are conditions for catalytic hydrogenation.

So, when X is treated with H2 and Pt, it might hydrogenate the double bonds in X. But wait, the problem says that treating X with Pt when heated forms Y via disproportionation. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read that again.

Wait, the problem says: X is treated with platinum when heated, leading to Y via disproportionation. So, the reaction is a disproportionation reaction, which is when one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So X is a substance that can act as both oxidizing and reducing agent, and in this case, breaks down into two different products.

But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps each component of X undergoes disproportionation when heated with Pt. Or maybe one of the components does. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the mixture X consists of two alkenes, which upon hydrogenation become alkanes. But wait, that's just hydrogenation, not a disproportionation. Oh, wait, but the question states that Y is formed through a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps each component of X is undergoing a different reaction when hydrogenated, leading to two different products. Or maybe the components of X themselves are undergoing some kind of disproportionation.

Wait, another thought. Suppose X is a mixture of two alkenes. When treated with H2 and Pt, they hydrogenate to alkanes. But that's not a disproportionation. So perhaps X isn't alkenes. Or maybe one of the components is something else, like an alkyne or an aromatic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. Upon hydrogenation, the alkene would become an alkane, and the alkyne would become an alkane as well, but maybe at different rates. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a disproportionation.

Wait, the problem states that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed via a disproportionation. So perhaps one of the components in X is something that can undergo a disproportionation reaction when hydrogenated. For example, maybe X contains an alkyne. When hydrogenated, an alkyne can add two H2 molecules to become an alkane, but what about the reaction conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and a diene. But that doesn't directly point me to a solution.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z. So, Z must be a saturated compound because it's a hydrocarbon and doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, Z is an alkane.

Furthermore, Z is part of mixture Y. Which makes sense because Y is a mixture of two products from X after hydrogenation. So, perhaps one component of Y is Z, and the other is something else.

Wait, but when X is hydrogenated, both components of X hydrogenate to Z. So maybe X is a mixture of two different compounds, each of which upon hydrogenation gives Z. Hmm, but that would imply that both components of X are structurally similar but differ in some way that upon hydrogenation they become the same Z. But that seems unlikely unless they are isomers. Or perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that hydrogenate to the same alkane Z?

Wait, but what is Z? The problem says Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z.

The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So 14.28% is about 14.28/100 = 0.1428. So, let's say the formula of Z is CnHm.

The mass percent of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) * 100 = 14.28.

So, 0.1428 = (m)/(12n + m)

Let me rearrange:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to remove decimals:

1000m = 142.8*(12n + m)

Hmm, but perhaps I'll think of 14.28% as approximately 1/7. So 0.1428 is roughly 1/7.

So,

m/(12n + m) ≈ 1/7

Cross-multiplying:

7m = 12n + m --> 6m = 12n --> m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n, but wait, that's for a molecule like ethylene, but Z is an alkane, right? Because it's a saturated hydrocarbon that doesn't react with hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, no, Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with H2, so it's saturated, meaning it's an alkane. So the formula should be CnH2(2n+2)?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. For alkanes, the formula is CnH2n+2.

Wait, but I thought Z is an alkane, so it's CnH2n+2. Let's plug that into the equation.

So, for Z, m = 2n + 2.

The mass fraction of H is:

(2n + 2) * 1 / (12n + 2n + 2) ) = (2n+2)/(14n + 2) ) = 14.28%.

Let me compute (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n +2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Compute 0.1428 *14n = 2n, because 14 * 1/7 is 2.

And 0.1428 *2 = approximately 0.2856.

So,

2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856

Hmm, subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856

Wait, that's not possible. So maybe my assumption that Z is an alkane is wrong? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, let me compute 14.28% as 1/7 (since 1/7 is approximately 0.1428). So,

(m)/(12n + m) = 1/7

Cross multiplying: 7m =12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. Which is the formula for an alkene. But Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react with H2, so it's saturated, implying it's an alkane. So, CnH2n+2.

Hmm, I'm getting a contradiction here. Maybe I need to re-express it.

Let me think of Z's formula as CnHm. So,

(m / (12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28.

So,

m/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me solve for m in terms of n.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Bring all m terms to one side:

m - 0.1428 m = 0.1428 * 12n → 0.8572 m ≈ 1.7136 n

Wait, 0.1428 * 12 is approximately 1.7136.

So,

m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572) *n ≈ 2n.

So again, m≈2n, which suggests the formula is CnH2n. But that's an alkene, which would react with H2. But the problem says Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe Z isn't an alkane but an alkyl halide or something else. No, the problem says Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's C and H only.

Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane? Like cyclopropane, cyclobutane, etc. Let's think.

For example, cyclopropane is C3H6. Let's check its hydrogen mass fraction.

Hydrogen's molar mass is 6 g/mol. The molecular weight is 3*12 +6 = 42 g/mol.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 6/42 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Oh! So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So, Z is cyclopropane. Because 6/(3*12 +6)=6/(42)=1/7=14.28%.

So Z is C3H6, cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is an alkene? No, wait, cyclopropane has a ring but no double bonds. Wait, no, it's a strained alkane. No, wait, cyclopropane is a saturated compound with a three-membered ring. So it's an alkane. So, cyclopropane is C3H6, and that makes sense.

So, Z is cyclopropane, which is an alkane and doesn't react further with hydrogen because it's already saturated.

Now, going back to the problem. When X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So, X must be something that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane. Wait, but hydrogenation typically adds hydrogen to unsaturated bonds to make them saturated. So, if X gives Z upon hydrogenation, X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a saturated molecule, so X must be a dihydrogenated compound. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane. But that doesn't make much sense because hydrogenating an alkene would produce an alkane, not a cyclopropane.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. Wait, if you hydrogenate an alkene, you get an alkane, but maybe X is a cyclic alkene whose hydrogenation gives cyclopropane.

Wait, cyclopropane's structure has a three-membered ring. So, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, which when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. But that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of an alkene would add two H's, turning it into an alkane, but cyclopropane has three C's, so the starting material would have to be a cyclopropane with some double bonds.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes or something else.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. No, that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach. The problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, each component of X has a double bond. But X's components don't have conjugated double bonds, as per the problem statement.

So, each component of X is a compound with a single double bond (maybe isolated), which can decolorize bromine water because bromine adds across the double bond.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So, the reaction is not just hydrogenation but some kind of disproportionation.

Wait, perhaps the components of X are such that when hydrogenated, they form Y. But the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed. Oh, wait, maybe the treatment with Pt is for hydrogenation, but the reaction is not just simple hydrogenation but a disproportionation.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the components of X is something that can undergo a disproportionation reaction when hydrogenated. But I'm not sure what that would be.

Wait, let's think. Hydrogenation typically adds H2 across double bonds. If X has an alkene and another compound, perhaps an alkyne. Because alkenes and alkynes can both add H2, but under different conditions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that upon treatment with Pt and heat, X forms Y via a disproportionation. So, perhaps X is a mixture containing a compound that can disproportionate into two different products.

Wait, for example, if X is a mixture of an alkene and a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are isomers, and their hydrogenation gives a single product. But wait, the problem says after hydrogenation, both X and Y give Z. So, when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z. So, X and Y must be such that their hydrogenation gives the same product.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two components, which upon hydrogenation give Z. Similarly, Y is a mixture of two components that also upon hydrogenation give Z.

So, perhaps the components of X and Y are in a way that upon hydrogenation, they all become Z.

So, let me think: if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation becomes Z, which is cyclopropane. But cyclopropane has three carbons. So, the alkenes must have three carbons? Because hydrogenation would add two H's to each double bond.

Wait, for example, if X consists of propene (propylene, C3H6) and another alkene, but wait, hydrogenating propene would give propane, which is C3H8. That's not cyclopropane.

Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of an alkene would open the ring if it's cyclic.

Wait, perhaps X contains cyclic alkenes. For instance, cyclopropane with a double bond? No, cyclopropane doesn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe a cyclopropane derivative with a substituent that has a double bond. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compounds in X are each a diene, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another angle: since X is a mixture of two liquids, which upon hydrogenation give Z (cyclopropane), perhaps X's components are dihydrogenated to form cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a three-carbon compound. Let's think: if the starting material is an ethylene (C2H4), hydrogenation would give ethane (C2H6), which isn't Z. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the starting materials are larger molecules.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. So, the starting materials in X must be something that upon hydrogenation give cyclopropane. But that would require the starting material to have a structure that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond. For example, cyclopropene (a three-membered ring with one double bond). If you hydrogenate cyclopropene, the double bond would add H2, turning it into cyclopropane.

But cyclopropene is a highly strained molecule, but perhaps it's a possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclopropane. But that doesn't make sense because adding H2 to an alkene would make an alkane, not a cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane and another compound, but this seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction that forms Y from X: it's a disproportionation with the use of Pt and heat. So, maybe X is a dihydrogenation product of Y.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of an alkene and something else. But I'm not making progress this way.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of ethylene and another compound. Wait, ethylene (C2H4) upon hydrogenation gives ethane (C2H6). But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture that includes a diene and another compound. Let me think differently.

Let me think about the other information: there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So, any double bonds in X's components are either isolated or part of a ring but not conjugated.

So, perhaps X's components have single double bonds, not conjugated.

Now, since both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, each component in X and Y must hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes a part of Z. But Z is cyclopropane, so maybe the alkenes in X are part of cyclopropane rings but have double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are like cyclopropane with a double bond. Wait, but cyclopropane doesn't have a double bond. So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are part of a larger structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogenated, each becomes a different part that combines to form cyclopropane. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives the same cyclopropane. But how?

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkenes in X are each part of a ring. For example, cyclopentene and another cyclic alkene. But hydrogenating them would give cyclopentane and another cycloalkane. But Z is cyclopropane, so that's not fitting.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of Y. Y is a mixture of two liquids that doesn't decolorize bromine. So, their structures don't have double bonds. So, Y's components are saturated.

When X is treated with Pt and heated to form Y via a disproportionation, perhaps the Pt is causing some kind of addition or decomposition reaction.

Wait, another thought. Maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation (with Pt and heat) become Y. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are saturated. So, the alkenes in X are hydrogenated to alkanes in Y. But the problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation, not just hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diene or something that upon hydrogenation forms Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, let me think about the options given for the number of H atoms in the two liquids of X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. Let me see.

Each liquid in X is a compound that upon hydrogenation gives Z (cyclopropane, C3H6). So, the starting material in X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation becomes C3H6.

Wait, hydrogenation adds H2. So, if a compound has a double bond, adding H2 would turn it into a single bond. So, for example, C3H4 (propyne) upon hydrogenation would become C3H8 (propane). But that's not Z.

Wait, but Z is C3H6. So, perhaps the starting material has a triple bond. For example, propyne (C3H4) upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst would become propane (C3H8), but that's not Z. Alternatively, maybe a dihydrogenated starting material.

Wait, another approach: If Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, then perhaps the starting materials in X are each a cyclopropane with a double bond. But again, cyclopropane doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a monohydride of cyclopropane. No, that's not a standard compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are allyl groups attached to something else, but that's getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclopropane. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the hydrogenation of X and Y. If both X and Y give Z upon hydrogenation, then perhaps X and Y are just different isomers of the same starting material. Or perhaps they are compounds that can hydrogenate to the same product.

Wait, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, another thought: Since Y does not decolorize bromine, it's fully saturated. So, Y's components are alkanes. X's components are alkenes or alkynes, which can decolorize bromine.

After hydrogenation, both X and Y produce Z, which is cyclopropane. So, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation gives cyclopropane.

Wait, but how? Hydrogenation of an alkene adds two H's. So, if X is an alkene with a certain structure, adding two H's would form a cyclopropane ring.

Wait, for example, if X is a cyclopropene (a three-membered ring with one double bond), then hydrogenation would add two H's to the double bond, turning it into cyclopropane.

So, cyclopropene (C3H4) upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pt would become cyclopropane (C3H6). That makes sense.

So, if X is a mixture of two cyclopropene derivatives, but that seems unlikely as cyclopropene is not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, but each alkene would have to have a structure that, upon hydrogenation, forms cyclopropane. So, for instance, if each component of X is a different diene or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different cyclopropenes. But that would mean Y is a mixture of the same product, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the hydrogenation step.

If both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is C3H6 (cyclopropane), then the hydrogenation of X and Y must be producing cyclopropane. So X and Y must be compounds that can hydrogenate to cyclopropane.

Wait, but hydrogenation typically adds H2 across double bonds. So, unless X and Y have rings with double bonds, their hydrogenation would not form rings.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are something like acetylene (C2H2) and another alkyne. But adding H2 to acetylene would produce ethane (C2H6), not cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are something else. Let's think: if the starting material is an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds), but that would have conjugated double bonds, which the problem says X doesn't have. So X's components can't have conjugated double bonds.

Wait, another angle: The mixture Y after the reaction with Pt is formed via a disproportionation. So, perhaps X is a single compound that undergoes disproportionation into two products, but the problem says X is a mixture of two liquids.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and each alkene upon hydrogenation gives a different product, but both products are Z. So, each alkene in X, when hydrogenated, gives Z. But that would mean that Y is a mixture of two products, both of which hydrogenate to Z. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes (like C3H6 and another), but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of H atoms in the two liquids of X.

The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Assuming each liquid in X is a compound with a certain number of H atoms. Let's say each compound in X has m and n H atoms. So the total number of H atoms in X is m + n.

But wait, the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So, each component of X is a liquid, so each has a certain number of H atoms. So, if X has two components, each with a certain number of H's, the total is the sum of H's in both.

Wait, but the problem is talking about the total number of H atoms in two liquids of X. So, perhaps each liquid in X is an alkene, and when hydrogenated, each becomes Z, which is C3H6.

So, perhaps each component of X is a different structure that upon hydrogenation gives C3H6.

Wait, for example, if X is a mixture of 1-propene and 2-propene (but that's the same as propene). No, that's not a mixture. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of propene and another alkene.

Wait, but let's think about the hydrogenation. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane, then each of those alkenes must be cyclopropene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the starting compounds in X are something else entirely. Let me think about the possible structures.

Another approach: Since Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane), and the starting materials (X and Y) hydrogenate to Z, perhaps the starting materials have a higher number of H's, but that's not possible because hydrogenation adds H's.

Wait, no. Hydrogenation adds H's. So, Z has more H's than the starting material. For example, if a starting material is C3H4 (alkyne or allene), hydrogenation would add two H's, making it C3H6. So, that makes sense.

So, if X's components are C3H4, which when hydrogenated with H2 and Pt would become C3H6 (Z). But then X would be a mixture of two C3H4 compounds, but that's a bit odd.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps each component is an alkyne (like propyne) or an allene.

But wait, if X is a mixture of propyne (C3H4) and another alkyne, upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pt, they would become propane (C3H8), which is not Z. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but Z is C3H6. So, maybe X's components are alkenes with four H's. Wait, an alkene has the formula CnH2n. So, for n=3, it's C3H6, which is propene. But hydrogenation would turn it into propane, which is C3H8. So that's not Z.

Wait, perhaps X's components are something else. Let me think differently: If Z is C3H6, then the starting material must have a double bond, and upon hydrogenation, it adds two H's to become Z. So, the starting material must have the formula C3H4.

C3H4 could be propyne (HC≡CCH2?), wait no. Propyne is C3H4. So, if X is a mixture of propyne and another C3H4 compound, hydrogenation would add two H's, making them C3H6. So, Z would be C3H6, which is cyclopropane.

Wait, but propyne is a linear alkyne, so when hydrogenated, it becomes propane (C3H8), not cyclopropane (C3H6). So, that's a problem.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the structure of Y. Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction when X is treated with Pt and heated. So, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes, but I'm not seeing how that would involve a disproportionation.

Wait, another thought: If the starting material is an alkyne, it can undergo hydrogenation to an alkene under certain conditions, and further hydrogenation to an alkane. But if the reaction stops at the alkene stage, then the product would be an alkene, but the problem says that after hydrogenation, only Z is formed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions for X and Y are different. The problem states that when X is treated with Pt under certain conditions, it forms Y via a disproportionation. Then, when X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they give Z.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne, but that's not right because Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which suggests no double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes. So, when X is hydrogenated, it forms Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes, and when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. But that's not possible because alkanes don't react with hydrogen.

Wait, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, perhaps Y is some unsaturated compound that also hydrogenates to Z.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, implying it's saturated. So, Y's components are alkanes and don't have double bonds. So, how can Y hydrogenate to give Z, which is a different compound?

This is getting really confusing. Maybe I should take a different approach and consider the possible structures for X and Y.

Given that Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), which has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%, that part checks out.

Let me think about X. X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. So, each component has a double bond. They can't have conjugated double bonds, so maybe each has a single double bond.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So, perhaps X's components are such that one is oxidized and the other is reduced, but I'm not sure how that applies in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, forms a different product, but both end up as Z.

Wait, but earlier I thought that hydrogenation of an alkene would give an alkane, but Z is an alkane. So, perhaps each component of X is an alkene, and when hydrogenated, they form Z.

Wait, but that would require each alkene in X to be a two-carbon compound. Because if X's alkenes are two carbons, then hydrogenation would give two carbons with two more H's. Let's see:

For example, if X is ethylene (C2H4), hydrogenation gives ethane (C2H6). But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X's alkenes are three carbons, but that leads to longer alkanes upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, so perhaps X's alkenes are C3H4 (like propyne, but that's an alkyne). Alternatively, perhaps X's alkenes are something else.

Wait, another angle: Since Y is formed via a disproportionation, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, undergo a reaction that forms Y through a different pathway. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and their hydrogenation produces Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes. Then, when Y is hydrogenated, perhaps under more severe conditions, it breaks down into Z. But that seems unlikely because alkanes don't react with hydrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of alkanes and alkynes, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: If X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of their respective hydrogenation products, which are alkanes. Then, perhaps Y, under more severe hydrogenation conditions, could decompose into Z.

But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total number of H atoms in X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. So, perhaps each component of X has 8 and 14 H atoms, adding up to 22. Or maybe each has 9 and 13, adding to 22, but that's just a guess.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the two liquids in X are each an alkene with a certain number of H's. Let's say each has n H's. So, the total is 2n.

Looking at the options, 16 would imply each has 8, which isn't divisible by 2. Wait, no, 16 would mean each has 8 H's, but each component is a linear alkene.

Wait, for example, propene (C3H6) has 6 H's. But that would sum to 12 for two components. Hmm, the option D is 12. But let me check.

If X is a mixture of two propene molecules, but that's the same compound, not a mixture. So, perhaps X is a mixture of propene and another alkene. Let's say the other is 1-pentene (C5H10). Propene has 6 H's, pentene has 10 H's. 6 +10=16? That would be option A. But why would their hydrogenation give Z, which is C3H6?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because hydrogenating pentene would give pentane (C5H12), not cyclopropane. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the two components in X have 8 and 14 H's, totaling 22. So, option C is 22.

But what compounds would those be? Wait, maybe each is an alkyne. For example, propyne (C3H4) has 4 H's, and another alkyne with 18 H's? That seems way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps each is a cyclic alkene with a certain number of H's. For example, cyclopentene (C5H8). If X is a mixture of two cyclopentene-like compounds, each with 8 H's, then the total would be 16. But then hydrogenation would give cyclopentane, not cyclopropane.

Alternatively, maybe each component of X is a ring with a double bond, such as cyclopropane with a double bond, but I don't think such a compound exists.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different acetylenes, each with 4 H's. But 4 +4=8, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, another thought: If each component of X is a dihydrogenated compound, perhaps something like 1,3-butadiene, which is a conjugated diene. But the problem says X has no conjugated double bonds, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps each component of X is a single double bond, like 1-pentene (C5H10), which has 10 H's. If there are two such molecules, 10 +10=20, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe each has 11 H's, but that's not possible for an alkene.

Hmm, I'm running out of ideas. Let me recap:

- Z is cyclopropane (C3H6).
- X is a mixture of two alkenes (no conjugated double bonds), which upon hydrogenation give Z.
- So, each alkene in X must hydrogenate to cyclopropane.
- Cyclopropane has three carbons, so each alkene in X must have three carbons (since adding H2 would not change the number of carbons, just the H's).

So, each alkene in X is a three-carbon compound with a double bond. The possible three-carbon alkenes are propene (C3H6) and another isomer, but propene is the only three-carbon alkene. So, that can't be a mixture.

Wait, unless X is a mixture of propene with another compound. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X's alkenes are cyclopropane derivatives. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: Maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives Z. So, each alkene in X must have a structure that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclopropane.

But how? For example, if an alkene is part of a ring, then hydrogenation would add H's and perhaps close the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are cyclic and have a bridge, so that upon hydrogenation, they form cyclopropane.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which is a different diene that when hydrogenated gives cyclopropane. But that's speculative.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the answer that makes sense with the number of H's. The options are A) 16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

From earlier, Z is C3H6. So, if each component of X is a three-carbon compound, perhaps each is C3H4 (like propyne), which upon hydrogenation would become C3H6. But then, each would have 4 H's. So, two components would have 4 each, totaling 8, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each component is C3H6 (propene), which upon hydrogenation gives C3H8 (propane), but that's not Z.

Wait, but earlier calculations showed that Z must be C3H6, which is cyclopropane. So, perhaps X's components are C3H4 compounds, such as propyne. Each would have 4 H's. So, two components → 4+4=8 H's, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each component is a four-carbon compound. For example, butene (C4H8), which upon hydrogenation becomes butane (C4H10). But that doesn't give Z.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are 12, 16, 18, 22.

From earlier, Z is C3H6. Each component of X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation gives Z. So, perhaps each has C3H4. So, two components with 4 H's each. 4+4=8. Not an option.

Alternatively, maybe they're larger. Suppose each component is C4H6. Each has 6 H's. Two components would total 12, which is option D.

So, 12 H's in total. So, each component has 6 H's, which fits C4H6.

Wait, but C4H6 could be 1-butene (C4H8) which is not right. Alternatively, 1,3-butadiene is C4H6 but has conjugated double bonds, which X doesn't have.

So, perhaps each component is a monoene with four carbons and six H's. For example, 2-pentene? No, that's five carbons.

Wait, maybe each component is a cyclic monoene, like cyclobutene (C4H6). Cyclobutene is a four-membered ring with a double bond. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclobutane (C4H8), which isn't Z. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should go with the option that fits my earlier calculation and the structure of Z.

If Z is C3H6, and each component of X must have a formula that upon adding H2 gives Z. So, perhaps each component is C3H4. Two such components would have 4 H's each, totaling 8, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm wrong about Z.

Wait, perhaps Z is not cyclopropane. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe Z is propane. Propane's formula is C3H8. Let's compute its hydrogen mass fraction.

Hydrogen mass is 8 g/mol. Molecular weight is 3*12 +8 =44 g/mol. So, 8/44 ≈ 18.18%, which is higher than 14.28%. So that's not Z.

Wait, if Z is ethane (C2H6), then hydrogen mass is 6/(24+6) =6/30=20%, which is higher than 14.28%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Z is a different molecule. Let me recalculate.

If Z is a four-carbon compound, let's see.

Suppose Z is CnHm.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% → (m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Assume Z is an alkane: CnH2n+2.

So,

(2n+2) / (12n + 2n +2) = (2n+2)/(14n +2) ) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n +2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Calculate 0.1428 *14n = 2n (since 14 * 1/7 = 2).

0.1428 *2 ≈ 0.2856.

So,

2n +2 = 2n +0.2856

Subtract 2n:

2 = 0.2856 → which is impossible.

So, that can't be. So, Z can't be an alkane.

Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react with H2, so it's saturated. So it must be an alkane or cycloalkane.

Wait, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane with more than three carbons. Let's try C4H8 (cyclobutane).

Hydrogen mass: 8/(48 +8) =8/56=1/7≈14.28%. Oh! So Z is C4H8, cyclobutane.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, Z is cyclobutane, C4H8.

So, then when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclobutane. So, X's components must have a structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclobutane.

So, X's components would be C4H6, which are alkenes. Let's say X is a mixture of two different C4H6 alkenes.

Each alkene in X has the formula C4H6. So, each has 6 H's. Two components would have a total of 12 H's. So, the total number of H's in X would be 6 (for each component) ×2 =12. So, option D is 12.

That fits. So, the answer would be D)12.

The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Mixture X is a liquid mixture of two compounds that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of double bonds.
   - X undergoes a disproportionation reaction with platinum and heat to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y is fully saturated.
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield a single hydrocarbon Z, which is a constituent of Y and does not react further with hydrogen. Z is identified as cyclobutane (C₄H₈), as its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%.
   - X contains no conjugated double bonds.

2. **Structure of Z**:
   - Z is identified as cyclobutane (C₄H₈). Its hydrogen mass fraction is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hydrogen mass fraction} = \frac{8}{(4 \times 12) + 8} = \frac{8}{56} \approx 14.28\%.
     \]
   - Since Z is a saturated compound, it does not react further with hydrogen.

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, yield Z (C₄H₈). This implies that the components of X and Y must hydrogenate to form cyclobutane.
   - X is a mixture of two alkenes (C₄H₆), as alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. Each component of X has 6 hydrogen atoms.

4. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - X is a mixture of two liquids, each with the formula C₄H₆. Since each component has 6 hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of X is:
     \[
     6 \times 2 = 12.
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **12**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully and try to break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Z is part of mixture Y and is a common solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably saturated.

Moreover, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So, whatever X is, its components don't have conjugated double bonds, like maybe isolated double bonds or maybe just single bonds.

Hmm. So, let me think about what mixture X could be. Since X decolorizes bromine water, that suggests it has double bonds because bromine adds across double bonds, causing the solution to decolorize. Wait, but wait, if X is a mixture of two liquids, each of which can decolorize bromine, they must have some unsaturated bonds.

But wait, mixture Y from X doesn't decolorize bromine. So, perhaps the reaction involves hydrogenation. Oh, because the reaction uses platinum and heat, which are conditions for catalytic hydrogenation.

So, when X is treated with H2 and Pt, it might hydrogenate the double bonds in X. But wait, the problem says that treating X with Pt when heated forms Y via disproportionation. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read that again.

Wait, the problem says: X is treated with platinum when heated, leading to Y via disproportionation. So, the reaction is a disproportionation reaction, which is when one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So X is a substance that can act as both oxidizing and reducing agent, and in this case, breaks down into two different products.

But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps each component of X undergoes disproportionation when heated with Pt. Or maybe one of the components does. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the mixture X consists of two alkenes, which upon hydrogenation become alkanes. But wait, that's just hydrogenation, not a disproportionation. Oh, wait, but the question states that Y is formed through a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps each component of X is undergoing a different reaction when hydrogenated, leading to two different products. Or maybe the components of X themselves are undergoing some kind of disproportionation.

Wait, another thought. Suppose X is a mixture of two alkenes. When treated with H2 and Pt, they hydrogenate to alkanes. But that's not a disproportionation. So perhaps X isn't alkenes. Or maybe one of the components is something else, like an alkyne or an aromatic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. Upon hydrogenation, the alkene would become an alkane, and the alkyne would become an alkane as well, but maybe at different rates. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a disproportionation.

Wait, the problem states that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed via a disproportionation. So perhaps one of the components in X is something that can undergo a disproportionation reaction when hydrogenated. For example, maybe X contains an alkyne. When hydrogenated, an alkyne can add two H2 molecules to become an alkane, but what about the reaction conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and a diene. But that doesn't directly point me to a solution.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z. So, Z must be a saturated compound because it's a hydrocarbon and doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, Z is an alkane.

Furthermore, Z is part of mixture Y. Which makes sense because Y is a mixture of two products from X after hydrogenation. So, perhaps one component of Y is Z, and the other is something else.

Wait, but when X is hydrogenated, both components of X hydrogenate to Z. So maybe X is a mixture of two different compounds, each of which upon hydrogenation gives Z. Hmm, but that would imply that both components of X are structurally similar but differ in some way that upon hydrogenation they become the same Z. But that seems unlikely unless they are isomers. Or perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that hydrogenate to the same alkane Z?

Wait, but what is Z? The problem says Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z.

The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So 14.28% is about 14.28/100 = 0.1428. So, let's say the formula of Z is CnHm.

The mass percent of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) * 100 = 14.28.

So, 0.1428 = (m)/(12n + m)

Let me rearrange:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to remove decimals:

1000m = 142.8*(12n + m)

Hmm, but perhaps I'll think of 14.28% as approximately 1/7. So 0.1428 is roughly 1/7.

So,

m/(12n + m) ≈ 1/7

Cross-multiplying:

7m = 12n + m --> 6m = 12n --> m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n, but wait, that's for a molecule like ethylene, but Z is an alkane, right? Because it's a saturated hydrocarbon that doesn't react with hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, no, Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with H2, so it's saturated, meaning it's an alkane. So the formula should be CnH2(2n+2)?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. For alkanes, the formula is CnH2n+2.

Wait, but I thought Z is an alkane, so it's CnH2n+2. Let's plug that into the equation.

So, for Z, m = 2n + 2.

The mass fraction of H is:

(2n + 2) * 1 / (12n + 2n + 2) ) = (2n+2)/(14n + 2) ) = 14.28%.

Let me compute (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n +2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Compute 0.1428 *14n = 2n, because 14 * 1/7 is 2.

And 0.1428 *2 = approximately 0.2856.

So,

2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856

Hmm, subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856

Wait, that's not possible. So maybe my assumption that Z is an alkane is wrong? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, let me compute 14.28% as 1/7 (since 1/7 is approximately 0.1428). So,

(m)/(12n + m) = 1/7

Cross multiplying: 7m =12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. Which is the formula for an alkene. But Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react with H2, so it's saturated, implying it's an alkane. So, CnH2n+2.

Hmm, I'm getting a contradiction here. Maybe I need to re-express it.

Let me think of Z's formula as CnHm. So,

(m / (12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28.

So,

m/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me solve for m in terms of n.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Bring all m terms to one side:

m - 0.1428 m = 0.1428 * 12n → 0.8572 m ≈ 1.7136 n

Wait, 0.1428 * 12 is approximately 1.7136.

So,

m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572) *n ≈ 2n.

So again, m≈2n, which suggests the formula is CnH2n. But that's an alkene, which would react with H2. But the problem says Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe Z isn't an alkane but an alkyl halide or something else. No, the problem says Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's C and H only.

Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane? Like cyclopropane, cyclobutane, etc. Let's think.

For example, cyclopropane is C3H6. Let's check its hydrogen mass fraction.

Hydrogen's molar mass is 6 g/mol. The molecular weight is 3*12 +6 = 42 g/mol.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 6/42 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Oh! So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So, Z is cyclopropane. Because 6/(3*12 +6)=6/(42)=1/7=14.28%.

So Z is C3H6, cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is an alkene? No, wait, cyclopropane has a ring but no double bonds. Wait, no, it's a strained alkane. No, wait, cyclopropane is a saturated compound with a three-membered ring. So it's an alkane. So, cyclopropane is C3H6, and that makes sense.

So, Z is cyclopropane, which is an alkane and doesn't react further with hydrogen because it's already saturated.

Now, going back to the problem. When X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So, X must be something that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane. Wait, but hydrogenation typically adds hydrogen to unsaturated bonds to make them saturated. So, if X gives Z upon hydrogenation, X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a saturated molecule, so X must be a dihydrogenated compound. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane. But that doesn't make much sense because hydrogenating an alkene would produce an alkane, not a cyclopropane.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. Wait, if you hydrogenate an alkene, you get an alkane, but maybe X is a cyclic alkene whose hydrogenation gives cyclopropane.

Wait, cyclopropane's structure has a three-membered ring. So, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, which when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. But that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of an alkene would add two H's, turning it into an alkane, but cyclopropane has three C's, so the starting material would have to be a cyclopropane with some double bonds.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes or something else.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. No, that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach. The problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, each component of X has a double bond. But X's components don't have conjugated double bonds, as per the problem statement.

So, each component of X is a compound with a single double bond (maybe isolated), which can decolorize bromine water because bromine adds across the double bond.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So, the reaction is not just hydrogenation but some kind of disproportionation.

Wait, perhaps the components of X are such that when hydrogenated, they form Y. But the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed. Oh, wait, maybe the treatment with Pt is for hydrogenation, but the reaction is not just simple hydrogenation but a disproportionation.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the components of X is something that can undergo a disproportionation reaction when hydrogenated. But I'm not sure what that would be.

Wait, let's think. Hydrogenation typically adds H2 across double bonds. If X has an alkene and another compound, perhaps an alkyne. Because alkenes and alkynes can both add H2, but under different conditions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that upon treatment with Pt and heat, X forms Y via a disproportionation. So, perhaps X is a mixture containing a compound that can disproportionate into two different products.

Wait, for example, if X is a mixture of an alkene and a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are isomers, and their hydrogenation gives a single product. But wait, the problem says after hydrogenation, both X and Y give Z. So, when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z. So, X and Y must be such that their hydrogenation gives the same product.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two components, which upon hydrogenation give Z. Similarly, Y is a mixture of two components that also upon hydrogenation give Z.

So, perhaps the components of X and Y are in a way that upon hydrogenation, they all become Z.

So, let me think: if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation becomes Z, which is cyclopropane. But cyclopropane has three carbons. So, the alkenes must have three carbons? Because hydrogenation would add two H's to each double bond.

Wait, for example, if X consists of propene (propylene, C3H6) and another alkene, but wait, hydrogenating propene would give propane, which is C3H8. That's not cyclopropane.

Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of an alkene would open the ring if it's cyclic.

Wait, perhaps X contains cyclic alkenes. For instance, cyclopropane with a double bond? No, cyclopropane doesn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe a cyclopropane derivative with a substituent that has a double bond. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compounds in X are each a diene, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another angle: since X is a mixture of two liquids, which upon hydrogenation give Z (cyclopropane), perhaps X's components are dihydrogenated to form cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a three-carbon compound. Let's think: if the starting material is an ethylene (C2H4), hydrogenation would give ethane (C2H6), which isn't Z. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the starting materials are larger molecules.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. So, the starting materials in X must be something that upon hydrogenation give cyclopropane. But that would require the starting material to have a structure that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond. For example, cyclopropene (a three-membered ring with one double bond). If you hydrogenate cyclopropene, the double bond would add H2, turning it into cyclopropane.

But cyclopropene is a highly strained molecule, but perhaps it's a possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclopropane. But that doesn't make sense because adding H2 to an alkene would make an alkane, not a cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane and another compound, but this seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the reaction that forms Y from X: it's a disproportionation with the use of Pt and heat. So, maybe X is a dihydrogenation product of Y.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of an alkene and something else. But I'm not making progress this way.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of ethylene and another compound. Wait, ethylene (C2H4) upon hydrogenation gives ethane (C2H6). But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture that includes a diene and another compound. Let me think differently.

Let me think about the other information: there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So, any double bonds in X's components are either isolated or part of a ring but not conjugated.

So, perhaps X's components have single double bonds, not conjugated.

Now, since both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, each component in X and Y must hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes a part of Z. But Z is cyclopropane, so maybe the alkenes in X are part of cyclopropane rings but have double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are like cyclopropane with a double bond. Wait, but cyclopropane doesn't have a double bond. So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are part of a larger structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogenated, each becomes a different part that combines to form cyclopropane. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives the same cyclopropane. But how?

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkenes in X are each part of a ring. For example, cyclopentene and another cyclic alkene. But hydrogenating them would give cyclopentane and another cycloalkane. But Z is cyclopropane, so that's not fitting.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of Y. Y is a mixture of two liquids that doesn't decolorize bromine. So, their structures don't have double bonds. So, Y's components are saturated.

When X is treated with Pt and heated to form Y via a disproportionation, perhaps the Pt is causing some kind of addition or decomposition reaction.

Wait, another thought. Maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation (with Pt and heat) become Y. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are saturated. So, the alkenes in X are hydrogenated to alkanes in Y. But the problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation, not just hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diene or something that upon hydrogenation forms Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, let me think about the options given for the number of H atoms in the two liquids of X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. Let me see.

Each liquid in X is a compound that upon hydrogenation gives Z (cyclopropane, C3H6). So, the starting material in X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation becomes C3H6.

Wait, hydrogenation adds H2. So, if a compound has a double bond, adding H2 would turn it into a single bond. So, for example, C3H4 (propyne) upon hydrogenation would become C3H8 (propane). But that's not Z.

Wait, but Z is C3H6. So, perhaps the starting material has a triple bond. For example, propyne (C3H4) upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst would become propane (C3H8), but that's not Z. Alternatively, maybe a dihydrogenated starting material.

Wait, another approach: If Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, then perhaps the starting materials in X are each a cyclopropane with a double bond. But again, cyclopropane doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a monohydride of cyclopropane. No, that's not a standard compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are allyl groups attached to something else, but that's getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclopropane. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the hydrogenation of X and Y. If both X and Y give Z upon hydrogenation, then perhaps X and Y are just different isomers of the same starting material. Or perhaps they are compounds that can hydrogenate to the same product.

Wait, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, another thought: Since Y does not decolorize bromine, it's fully saturated. So, Y's components are alkanes. X's components are alkenes or alkynes, which can decolorize bromine.

After hydrogenation, both X and Y produce Z, which is cyclopropane. So, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation gives cyclopropane.

Wait, but how? Hydrogenation of an alkene adds two H's. So, if X is an alkene with a certain structure, adding two H's would form a cyclopropane ring.

Wait, for example, if X is a cyclopropene (a three-membered ring with one double bond), then hydrogenation would add two H's to the double bond, turning it into cyclopropane.

So, cyclopropene (C3H4) upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pt would become cyclopropane (C3H6). That makes sense.

So, if X is a mixture of two cyclopropene derivatives, but that seems unlikely as cyclopropene is not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclopropane.

Wait, but each alkene would have to have a structure that, upon hydrogenation, forms cyclopropane. So, for instance, if each component of X is a different diene or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different cyclopropenes. But that would mean Y is a mixture of the same product, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the hydrogenation step.

If both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is C3H6 (cyclopropane), then the hydrogenation of X and Y must be producing cyclopropane. So X and Y must be compounds that can hydrogenate to cyclopropane.

Wait, but hydrogenation typically adds H2 across double bonds. So, unless X and Y have rings with double bonds, their hydrogenation would not form rings.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are something like acetylene (C2H2) and another alkyne. But adding H2 to acetylene would produce ethane (C2H6), not cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are something else. Let's think: if the starting material is an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds), but that would have conjugated double bonds, which the problem says X doesn't have. So X's components can't have conjugated double bonds.

Wait, another angle: The mixture Y after the reaction with Pt is formed via a disproportionation. So, perhaps X is a single compound that undergoes disproportionation into two products, but the problem says X is a mixture of two liquids.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and each alkene upon hydrogenation gives a different product, but both products are Z. So, each alkene in X, when hydrogenated, gives Z. But that would mean that Y is a mixture of two products, both of which hydrogenate to Z. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes (like C3H6 and another), but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of H atoms in the two liquids of X.

The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Assuming each liquid in X is a compound with a certain number of H atoms. Let's say each compound in X has m and n H atoms. So the total number of H atoms in X is m + n.

But wait, the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So, each component of X is a liquid, so each has a certain number of H atoms. So, if X has two components, each with a certain number of H's, the total is the sum of H's in both.

Wait, but the problem is talking about the total number of H atoms in two liquids of X. So, perhaps each liquid in X is an alkene, and when hydrogenated, each becomes Z, which is C3H6.

So, perhaps each component of X is a different structure that upon hydrogenation gives C3H6.

Wait, for example, if X is a mixture of 1-propene and 2-propene (but that's the same as propene). No, that's not a mixture. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of propene and another alkene.

Wait, but let's think about the hydrogenation. If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane, then each of those alkenes must be cyclopropene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the starting compounds in X are something else entirely. Let me think about the possible structures.

Another approach: Since Z is C3H6 (cyclopropane), and the starting materials (X and Y) hydrogenate to Z, perhaps the starting materials have a higher number of H's, but that's not possible because hydrogenation adds H's.

Wait, no. Hydrogenation adds H's. So, Z has more H's than the starting material. For example, if a starting material is C3H4 (alkyne or allene), hydrogenation would add two H's, making it C3H6. So, that makes sense.

So, if X's components are C3H4, which when hydrogenated with H2 and Pt would become C3H6 (Z). But then X would be a mixture of two C3H4 compounds, but that's a bit odd.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps each component is an alkyne (like propyne) or an allene.

But wait, if X is a mixture of propyne (C3H4) and another alkyne, upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pt, they would become propane (C3H8), which is not Z. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but Z is C3H6. So, maybe X's components are alkenes with four H's. Wait, an alkene has the formula CnH2n. So, for n=3, it's C3H6, which is propene. But hydrogenation would turn it into propane, which is C3H8. So that's not Z.

Wait, perhaps X's components are something else. Let me think differently: If Z is C3H6, then the starting material must have a double bond, and upon hydrogenation, it adds two H's to become Z. So, the starting material must have the formula C3H4.

C3H4 could be propyne (HC≡CCH2?), wait no. Propyne is C3H4. So, if X is a mixture of propyne and another C3H4 compound, hydrogenation would add two H's, making them C3H6. So, Z would be C3H6, which is cyclopropane.

Wait, but propyne is a linear alkyne, so when hydrogenated, it becomes propane (C3H8), not cyclopropane (C3H6). So, that's a problem.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the structure of Y. Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction when X is treated with Pt and heated. So, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes, but I'm not seeing how that would involve a disproportionation.

Wait, another thought: If the starting material is an alkyne, it can undergo hydrogenation to an alkene under certain conditions, and further hydrogenation to an alkane. But if the reaction stops at the alkene stage, then the product would be an alkene, but the problem says that after hydrogenation, only Z is formed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions for X and Y are different. The problem states that when X is treated with Pt under certain conditions, it forms Y via a disproportionation. Then, when X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they give Z.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne, but that's not right because Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which suggests no double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes. So, when X is hydrogenated, it forms Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes, and when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. But that's not possible because alkanes don't react with hydrogen.

Wait, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, perhaps Y is some unsaturated compound that also hydrogenates to Z.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, implying it's saturated. So, Y's components are alkanes and don't have double bonds. So, how can Y hydrogenate to give Z, which is a different compound?

This is getting really confusing. Maybe I should take a different approach and consider the possible structures for X and Y.

Given that Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), which has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%, that part checks out.

Let me think about X. X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. So, each component has a double bond. They can't have conjugated double bonds, so maybe each has a single double bond.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So, perhaps X's components are such that one is oxidized and the other is reduced, but I'm not sure how that applies in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, upon hydrogenation, forms a different product, but both end up as Z.

Wait, but earlier I thought that hydrogenation of an alkene would give an alkane, but Z is an alkane. So, perhaps each component of X is an alkene, and when hydrogenated, they form Z.

Wait, but that would require each alkene in X to be a two-carbon compound. Because if X's alkenes are two carbons, then hydrogenation would give two carbons with two more H's. Let's see:

For example, if X is ethylene (C2H4), hydrogenation gives ethane (C2H6). But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X's alkenes are three carbons, but that leads to longer alkanes upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, so perhaps X's alkenes are C3H4 (like propyne, but that's an alkyne). Alternatively, perhaps X's alkenes are something else.

Wait, another angle: Since Y is formed via a disproportionation, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, undergo a reaction that forms Y through a different pathway. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and their hydrogenation produces Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes. Then, when Y is hydrogenated, perhaps under more severe conditions, it breaks down into Z. But that seems unlikely because alkanes don't react with hydrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of alkanes and alkynes, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: If X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of their respective hydrogenation products, which are alkanes. Then, perhaps Y, under more severe hydrogenation conditions, could decompose into Z.

But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total number of H atoms in X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. So, perhaps each component of X has 8 and 14 H atoms, adding up to 22. Or maybe each has 9 and 13, adding to 22, but that's just a guess.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the two liquids in X are each an alkene with a certain number of H's. Let's say each has n H's. So, the total is 2n.

Looking at the options, 16 would imply each has 8, which isn't divisible by 2. Wait, no, 16 would mean each has 8 H's, but each component is a linear alkene.

Wait, for example, propene (C3H6) has 6 H's. But that would sum to 12 for two components. Hmm, the option D is 12. But let me check.

If X is a mixture of two propene molecules, but that's the same compound, not a mixture. So, perhaps X is a mixture of propene and another alkene. Let's say the other is 1-pentene (C5H10). Propene has 6 H's, pentene has 10 H's. 6 +10=16? That would be option A. But why would their hydrogenation give Z, which is C3H6?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because hydrogenating pentene would give pentane (C5H12), not cyclopropane. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the two components in X have 8 and 14 H's, totaling 22. So, option C is 22.

But what compounds would those be? Wait, maybe each is an alkyne. For example, propyne (C3H4) has 4 H's, and another alkyne with 18 H's? That seems way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps each is a cyclic alkene with a certain number of H's. For example, cyclopentene (C5H8). If X is a mixture of two cyclopentene-like compounds, each with 8 H's, then the total would be 16. But then hydrogenation would give cyclopentane, not cyclopropane.

Alternatively, maybe each component of X is a ring with a double bond, such as cyclopropane with a double bond, but I don't think such a compound exists.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different acetylenes, each with 4 H's. But 4 +4=8, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, another thought: If each component of X is a dihydrogenated compound, perhaps something like 1,3-butadiene, which is a conjugated diene. But the problem says X has no conjugated double bonds, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps each component of X is a single double bond, like 1-pentene (C5H10), which has 10 H's. If there are two such molecules, 10 +10=20, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe each has 11 H's, but that's not possible for an alkene.

Hmm, I'm running out of ideas. Let me recap:

- Z is cyclopropane (C3H6).
- X is a mixture of two alkenes (no conjugated double bonds), which upon hydrogenation give Z.
- So, each alkene in X must hydrogenate to cyclopropane.
- Cyclopropane has three carbons, so each alkene in X must have three carbons (since adding H2 would not change the number of carbons, just the H's).

So, each alkene in X is a three-carbon compound with a double bond. The possible three-carbon alkenes are propene (C3H6) and another isomer, but propene is the only three-carbon alkene. So, that can't be a mixture.

Wait, unless X is a mixture of propene with another compound. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X's alkenes are cyclopropane derivatives. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: Maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives Z. So, each alkene in X must have a structure that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclopropane.

But how? For example, if an alkene is part of a ring, then hydrogenation would add H's and perhaps close the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are cyclic and have a bridge, so that upon hydrogenation, they form cyclopropane.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which is a different diene that when hydrogenated gives cyclopropane. But that's speculative.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the answer that makes sense with the number of H's. The options are A) 16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

From earlier, Z is C3H6. So, if each component of X is a three-carbon compound, perhaps each is C3H4 (like propyne), which upon hydrogenation would become C3H6. But then, each would have 4 H's. So, two components would have 4 each, totaling 8, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each component is C3H6 (propene), which upon hydrogenation gives C3H8 (propane), but that's not Z.

Wait, but earlier calculations showed that Z must be C3H6, which is cyclopropane. So, perhaps X's components are C3H4 compounds, such as propyne. Each would have 4 H's. So, two components → 4+4=8 H's, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each component is a four-carbon compound. For example, butene (C4H8), which upon hydrogenation becomes butane (C4H10). But that doesn't give Z.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are 12, 16, 18, 22.

From earlier, Z is C3H6. Each component of X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation gives Z. So, perhaps each has C3H4. So, two components with 4 H's each. 4+4=8. Not an option.

Alternatively, maybe they're larger. Suppose each component is C4H6. Each has 6 H's. Two components would total 12, which is option D.

So, 12 H's in total. So, each component has 6 H's, which fits C4H6.

Wait, but C4H6 could be 1-butene (C4H8) which is not right. Alternatively, 1,3-butadiene is C4H6 but has conjugated double bonds, which X doesn't have.

So, perhaps each component is a monoene with four carbons and six H's. For example, 2-pentene? No, that's five carbons.

Wait, maybe each component is a cyclic monoene, like cyclobutene (C4H6). Cyclobutene is a four-membered ring with a double bond. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclobutane (C4H8), which isn't Z. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should go with the option that fits my earlier calculation and the structure of Z.

If Z is C3H6, and each component of X must have a formula that upon adding H2 gives Z. So, perhaps each component is C3H4. Two such components would have 4 H's each, totaling 8, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm wrong about Z.

Wait, perhaps Z is not cyclopropane. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe Z is propane. Propane's formula is C3H8. Let's compute its hydrogen mass fraction.

Hydrogen mass is 8 g/mol. Molecular weight is 3*12 +8 =44 g/mol. So, 8/44 ≈ 18.18%, which is higher than 14.28%. So that's not Z.

Wait, if Z is ethane (C2H6), then hydrogen mass is 6/(24+6) =6/30=20%, which is higher than 14.28%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Z is a different molecule. Let me recalculate.

If Z is a four-carbon compound, let's see.

Suppose Z is CnHm.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% → (m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428.

Assume Z is an alkane: CnH2n+2.

So,

(2n+2) / (12n + 2n +2) = (2n+2)/(14n +2) ) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n +2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Calculate 0.1428 *14n = 2n (since 14 * 1/7 = 2).

0.1428 *2 ≈ 0.2856.

So,

2n +2 = 2n +0.2856

Subtract 2n:

2 = 0.2856 → which is impossible.

So, that can't be. So, Z can't be an alkane.

Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react with H2, so it's saturated. So it must be an alkane or cycloalkane.

Wait, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane with more than three carbons. Let's try C4H8 (cyclobutane).

Hydrogen mass: 8/(48 +8) =8/56=1/7≈14.28%. Oh! So Z is C4H8, cyclobutane.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, Z is cyclobutane, C4H8.

So, then when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclobutane. So, X's components must have a structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclobutane.

So, X's components would be C4H6, which are alkenes. Let's say X is a mixture of two different C4H6 alkenes.

Each alkene in X has the formula C4H6. So, each has 6 H's. Two components would have a total of 12 H's. So, the total number of H's in X would be 6 (for each component) ×2 =12. So, option D is 12.

That fits. So, the answer would be D)12.


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Mixture X is a liquid mixture of two compounds that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of double bonds.
   - X undergoes a disproportionation reaction with platinum and heat to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y is fully saturated.
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield a single hydrocarbon Z, which is a constituent of Y and does not react further with hydrogen. Z is identified as cyclobutane (C₄H₈), as its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%.
   - X contains no conjugated double bonds.

2. **Structure of Z**:
   - Z is identified as cyclobutane (C₄H₈). Its hydrogen mass fraction is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Hydrogen mass fraction} = \frac{8}{(4 \times 12) + 8} = \frac{8}{56} \approx 14.28\%.
     \]
   - Since Z is a saturated compound, it does not react further with hydrogen.

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, yield Z (C₄H₈). This implies that the components of X and Y must hydrogenate to form cyclobutane.
   - X is a mixture of two alkenes (C₄H₆), as alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. Each component of X has 6 hydrogen atoms.

4. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - X is a mixture of two liquids, each with the formula C₄H₆. Since each component has 6 hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of X is:
     \[
     6 \times 2 = 12.
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **12**.

Answer: D
