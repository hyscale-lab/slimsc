Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets. Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws are involved in orbital periods, but I'm not exactly sure how to apply them here. Let me read the problem again.

So, the scenario is that there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that affects the solution directly; the question is about their orbital periods.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, the ratios of their masses, and their albedos are the same as Earth's, which is 0.3. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, Planet1's Teq is 1.4 times Planet2's. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet2's Teq is 2.3 times Planet3's. Wait, so Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. So, Planet3 is the coldest among the three.

The mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So, Planet1 is heavier than Planet2, and Planet2 is heavier than Planet3.

Wait, but how does mass relate to the orbital period? I think Kepler's third law relates the period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star, but wait, the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star in most cases. So maybe the mass ratios here are a red herring, or perhaps they come into play in a different way.

Wait, this might be about the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula: Teq = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π * σ * a² )) )^(1/4) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Alternatively, another version I've heard is Teq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the formula is:

Teq = T_star * ( ( (1 - albedo) ) / ( 2(1 + e) ) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 AU) / a )^(1/2) )

Assuming circular orbits, which the question says they have, so e=0. Then that simplifies to Teq = T_star * ( (1 - albedo)/2 )^(1/4) * sqrt(1 AU / a).

Wait, but the star's temperature (T_star) would be the same for all planets if they're orbiting the same star, right? So, the ratio of Teq between the planets would depend on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes (a) multiplied by (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but since all have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio.

So, the Teq ratio between two planets would be sqrt( a2 / a1 ), where a1 and a2 are their semi-major axes. Wait, because Teq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if Planet A is hotter than Planet B, then a_A < a_B.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is Teq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Hmm, wait, maybe it's more accurate to model it as:

Teq = ( ( L (1 - albedo) ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4 )

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's orbital radius, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since L and (1-albedo) are the same for all planets (assuming same star and albedo), the equilibrium temperature depends on 1/sqrt(a).

So, (Teq1 / Teq2) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, for Planet1 and Planet2, Teq1/Teq2 = 1.4. So 1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Squaring both sides: 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 a1.

Wait, but wait, if Teq of planet1 is higher than planet2, then planet1 must be closer to the star. Because being closer would result in a higher equilibrium temperature. So, a1 < a2. So a2 = 1.96 a1. So, a2 is about 1.96 times a1.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, Teq2/Teq3 = 2.3. So, 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Squaring: 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 =5.29 a2.

So, a3 =5.29 * a2. But a2 is 1.96 a1, so a3 =5.29 *1.96 a1 ≈ 10.3784 a1.

Wait, so the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.3784 times that of Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, assuming the same star (so same mass). The formula is:

P² = (4π² / G M_star) ) a³

So, the ratio of periods would be (P3 / P1) = sqrt( (a3³) / (a1³) ) ) = (a3/a1)^(3/2)

We have a3/a1 ≈10.3784. So, (10.3784 )^1.5 → let's compute that.

Wait, 10.3784 is approximately 10.38.

So, let's compute 10.38^(3/2) → sqrt(10.38) is about 3.22. Then 3.22^3 is approximately 3.22 *3.22=10.3684, then *3.22 → 10.3684 *3.22 ≈33.35.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

10.38^(3/2) → same as (10.38)^(1.5) = sqrt(10.38) * 10.38.

sqrt(10.38) is sqrt(10) is about 3.1623, sqrt(10.24)=3.2, sqrt(10.38)= approx 3.222. So, 3.222 *10.38 ≈32.22. Hmm, approximately 32.2.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4, which is close to 32.2. Hmm, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 10.3784 is the a3/a1 ratio. Let me compute 10.3784^(3/2).

Take the square root first: sqrt(10.3784) ≈3.222.

Then, 10.3784 *3.222 = ?

Let me compute 10 *3.222 =32.22, 0.3784 *3.222 ≈1.218. So total is approximately 32.22 +1.218=33.438. Ah, so about 33.44. That's very close to option D, which is ~33.4.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So, D is the right answer.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the steps. Did I make any wrong assumptions?

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, so Teq1/Teq2=1.4 → a2= (Teq1^2 / Teq2^2 ) * a1. Wait, wait, wait. Let me rederive the equilibrium temperature formula properly.

Equilibrium temperature equation is:

Teq = T_star * ( ( L (1 - albedo) ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4 )

Assuming same star, same albedo for all, L and other constants are same. So,

Teq1 / Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, when Teq1 > Teq2, a2 >a1.

So, when Planet1's Teq is 1.4 times Planet2's, then a2 = (Teq1/Teq2)^2 *a1 → (1.4)^2 =1.96 → a2=1.96 a1.

Similarly, Teq2/Teq3=2.3 → sqrt( a3/a2 )=2.3 → (a3/a2)= (2.3)^2=5.29 → a3=5.29 a2.

So, a3=5.29 *1.96 a1 → let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96 → 5 *1.96=9.8, 0.29 *1.96≈0.5684 → total ≈10.3684 a1.

So, a3/a1 ≈10.3684.

Then, using Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ a^3 → P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) → (10.3684)^(1.5).

Compute (10.3684)^(3/2):

First, sqrt(10.3684) is about 3.22.

Then, 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ let's compute:

10 *3.22 =32.2

0.3684 *3.22 ≈ 1.186.

So 32.2 +1.186=33.386.

So, approximately 33.386. So, the factor is about 33.4, which matches option D.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data using the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis Relationship
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \left( \frac{L (1 - \text{albedo})}{16 \pi \sigma a^2} \right)^{1/4}
\]

Assuming the same star and albedo for all planets, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

From the problem:
- \( \frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = 1.4 \), so:
  \[
  1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies a_2 = 1.96 a_1
  \]

- \( \frac{T_{\text{eq,2}}}{T_{\text{eq,3}}} = 2.3 \), so:
  \[
  2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies a_3 = 5.29 a_2
  \]

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 a_1 \approx 10.3784 a_1
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.3784 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio Using Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \approx 10.3784 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3784)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3784} \approx 3.222 \). Then:
\[
(10.3784)^{3/2} = 10.3784 \cdot 3.222 \approx 33.44
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( 33.4 \) times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result to the options provided:

- **A) ~10.4**: Too small.
- **B) ~3.2**: Too small.
- **C) ~4.4**: Too small.
- **D) ~33.4**: Matches the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the orbital periods of three exoplanets. Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws are involved in orbital periods, but I'm not exactly sure how to apply them here. Let me read the problem again.

So, the scenario is that there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that affects the solution directly; the question is about their orbital periods.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, the ratios of their masses, and their albedos are the same as Earth's, which is 0.3. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, Planet1's Teq is 1.4 times Planet2's. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet2's Teq is 2.3 times Planet3's. Wait, so Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. So, Planet3 is the coldest among the three.

The mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So, Planet1 is heavier than Planet2, and Planet2 is heavier than Planet3.

Wait, but how does mass relate to the orbital period? I think Kepler's third law relates the period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star, but wait, the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star in most cases. So maybe the mass ratios here are a red herring, or perhaps they come into play in a different way.

Wait, this might be about the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula: Teq = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π * σ * a² )) )^(1/4) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Alternatively, another version I've heard is Teq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the formula is:

Teq = T_star * ( ( (1 - albedo) ) / ( 2(1 + e) ) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 AU) / a )^(1/2) )

Assuming circular orbits, which the question says they have, so e=0. Then that simplifies to Teq = T_star * ( (1 - albedo)/2 )^(1/4) * sqrt(1 AU / a).

Wait, but the star's temperature (T_star) would be the same for all planets if they're orbiting the same star, right? So, the ratio of Teq between the planets would depend on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes (a) multiplied by (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but since all have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio.

So, the Teq ratio between two planets would be sqrt( a2 / a1 ), where a1 and a2 are their semi-major axes. Wait, because Teq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so if Planet A is hotter than Planet B, then a_A < a_B.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is Teq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Hmm, wait, maybe it's more accurate to model it as:

Teq = ( ( L (1 - albedo) ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4 )

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's orbital radius, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since L and (1-albedo) are the same for all planets (assuming same star and albedo), the equilibrium temperature depends on 1/sqrt(a).

So, (Teq1 / Teq2) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, for Planet1 and Planet2, Teq1/Teq2 = 1.4. So 1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Squaring both sides: 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 a1.

Wait, but wait, if Teq of planet1 is higher than planet2, then planet1 must be closer to the star. Because being closer would result in a higher equilibrium temperature. So, a1 < a2. So a2 = 1.96 a1. So, a2 is about 1.96 times a1.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, Teq2/Teq3 = 2.3. So, 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Squaring: 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 =5.29 a2.

So, a3 =5.29 * a2. But a2 is 1.96 a1, so a3 =5.29 *1.96 a1 ≈ 10.3784 a1.

Wait, so the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.3784 times that of Planet1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, assuming the same star (so same mass). The formula is:

P² = (4π² / G M_star) ) a³

So, the ratio of periods would be (P3 / P1) = sqrt( (a3³) / (a1³) ) ) = (a3/a1)^(3/2)

We have a3/a1 ≈10.3784. So, (10.3784 )^1.5 → let's compute that.

Wait, 10.3784 is approximately 10.38.

So, let's compute 10.38^(3/2) → sqrt(10.38) is about 3.22. Then 3.22^3 is approximately 3.22 *3.22=10.3684, then *3.22 → 10.3684 *3.22 ≈33.35.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

10.38^(3/2) → same as (10.38)^(1.5) = sqrt(10.38) * 10.38.

sqrt(10.38) is sqrt(10) is about 3.1623, sqrt(10.24)=3.2, sqrt(10.38)= approx 3.222. So, 3.222 *10.38 ≈32.22. Hmm, approximately 32.2.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4, which is close to 32.2. Hmm, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 10.3784 is the a3/a1 ratio. Let me compute 10.3784^(3/2).

Take the square root first: sqrt(10.3784) ≈3.222.

Then, 10.3784 *3.222 = ?

Let me compute 10 *3.222 =32.22, 0.3784 *3.222 ≈1.218. So total is approximately 32.22 +1.218=33.438. Ah, so about 33.44. That's very close to option D, which is ~33.4.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So, D is the right answer.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the steps. Did I make any wrong assumptions?

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, so Teq1/Teq2=1.4 → a2= (Teq1^2 / Teq2^2 ) * a1. Wait, wait, wait. Let me rederive the equilibrium temperature formula properly.

Equilibrium temperature equation is:

Teq = T_star * ( ( L (1 - albedo) ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4 )

Assuming same star, same albedo for all, L and other constants are same. So,

Teq1 / Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, when Teq1 > Teq2, a2 >a1.

So, when Planet1's Teq is 1.4 times Planet2's, then a2 = (Teq1/Teq2)^2 *a1 → (1.4)^2 =1.96 → a2=1.96 a1.

Similarly, Teq2/Teq3=2.3 → sqrt( a3/a2 )=2.3 → (a3/a2)= (2.3)^2=5.29 → a3=5.29 a2.

So, a3=5.29 *1.96 a1 → let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96 → 5 *1.96=9.8, 0.29 *1.96≈0.5684 → total ≈10.3684 a1.

So, a3/a1 ≈10.3684.

Then, using Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ a^3 → P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) → (10.3684)^(1.5).

Compute (10.3684)^(3/2):

First, sqrt(10.3684) is about 3.22.

Then, 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ let's compute:

10 *3.22 =32.2

0.3684 *3.22 ≈ 1.186.

So 32.2 +1.186=33.386.

So, approximately 33.386. So, the factor is about 33.4, which matches option D.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data using the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis Relationship
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \left( \frac{L (1 - \text{albedo})}{16 \pi \sigma a^2} \right)^{1/4}
\]

Assuming the same star and albedo for all planets, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

From the problem:
- \( \frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = 1.4 \), so:
  \[
  1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies a_2 = 1.96 a_1
  \]

- \( \frac{T_{\text{eq,2}}}{T_{\text{eq,3}}} = 2.3 \), so:
  \[
  2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies a_3 = 5.29 a_2
  \]

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 a_1 \approx 10.3784 a_1
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.3784 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio Using Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \approx 10.3784 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3784)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3784} \approx 3.222 \). Then:
\[
(10.3784)^{3/2} = 10.3784 \cdot 3.222 \approx 33.44
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( 33.4 \) times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result to the options provided:

- **A) ~10.4**: Too small.
- **B) ~3.2**: Too small.
- **C) ~4.4**: Too small.
- **D) ~33.4**: Matches the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
