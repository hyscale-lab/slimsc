Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state.

The state given is (3i, 4). Hmm, I think that's a column vector, right? So it's probably a two-component vector because electrons are spin-1/2 particles. The state vector is [3i; 4], meaning the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying by the operator matrix, and then multiplying by the state vector again. Oh right, the formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ψ. That makes sense because σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-component of spin.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are given in the note. The σ_y matrix is:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So, I need to perform the matrix multiplication. Let me write down the steps.

First, write the state vector as ψ. So ψ is [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be the row vector [ -3 (because the conjugate of 3i is -3?), 4* ].

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the components are 3i and 4. The conjugate of 3i is (-3i)*, which is (-3i)* = -3i^*? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original vector is [3i;4]. So each component is: first is 3i, second is 4. So ψ† will be the transpose and conjugate, so the first element is the conjugate of 3i, which is -3i, and the second element is the conjugate of 4, which is 4 (since it's real). So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Next, we have to compute ψ† σ_y. Let's do that matrix multiplication.

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

Multiplying ψ† with σ_y:

First element: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) = (3i^2) since (-3i)*(-i) is 3i². Wait, i² is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, we need to multiply this by ψ, which is [3i;4]. So matrix multiplication:

⟨S_y⟩ = [4i, -3] * [3i;4].

So that's 4i*(3i) + (-3)*4.

Let me compute each term.

First term: 4i * 3i = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (-3)*4 = -12.

So adding them together: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but wait, I'm supposed to get the expectation value in terms of ħ. Oh, right! Because the Pauli matrices are in units of ħ. So the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the value we just found.

Wait, let me think. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So when I compute the expectation value, it's (ħ/2) times the trace we just calculated.

Wait no, the calculation I did was for σ_y, but the actual operator is (ħ/2) σ_y. So when I calculate the expectation value, which is ψ† (σ_y) ψ, but multiplied by (ħ/2).

So the expectation value would be [ (ψ† σ_y ψ) ] multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have eigenvalues ±1. But the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So when calculating ⟨S_y⟩, it's (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So in the problem, the given state is (3i,4). So let's compute ⟨σ_y⟩ first, which is ψ† σ_y ψ, and then multiply by ħ/2.

Earlier, I calculated ψ† σ_y ψ as -24. So ⟨σ_y⟩ is -24. Then ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) * (-24).

Wait, but that might not be right. Wait, no, wait. Let's double-check the computation of ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication. Let me recalculate.

So ψ is [3i;4], ψ† is [-3i,4].

Compute ψ† σ_y:

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

σ_y is [[0, -i],
         [i, 0]]

So the product is:

First row of ψ† times first column of σ_y: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

First row of ψ† times second column of σ_y: (-3i)*(-i) +4 *0 = 3i² +0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† sigma y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by ψ, which is [3i;4]:

So (4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4).

Calculating each part:

4i ×3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 ×4 = -12.

Adding them: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So yes, ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

Then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ ) /2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. Hmm, none of the other options match -12 hbar. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the state vector components. Let me check again. The state is given as (3i,4), so ψ is [3i;4]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So perhaps I should check if the given vector is normalized.

Compute the norm squared: |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So I should normalize the state, right? Because the expectation value calculations require the state to be normalized.

Oh wait, that's a crucial point. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (ψ normalized)† σ_y (ψ normalized), multiplied by ħ/2.

So the given state is [3i;4], which has a norm of 5. So the normalized state is (1/5) [3i;4].

So let me correct that.

So ψ_normalized is (1/5) [3i;4]. So ψ† becomes (1/5) [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, let's compute the expectation value again.

ψ† σ_y ψ = (1/5)[ -3i, 4 ] * sigma_y * (1/5) [3i;4 ].

Wait, so the matrix multiplication becomes:

First, (1/5)² =1/25. So factor is 1/25.

Then, the product of [ -3i,4 ] * sigma_y * [3i;4 ].

Which is the same as [ -3i,4 ] * [sigma_y [3i;4 ] ].

But wait, sigma_y is applied to the state [3i;4], which gives:

sigma_y * [3i;4] = [ (0*3i + (-i)*4 ), (i*3i +0*4) ].

Wait, let's compute sigma_y times [3i;4].

sigma_y is:

0  -i
i   0

So first component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So sigma_y [3i;4 ] = [ -4i ; -3 ].

Then, [ -3i,4 ] multiplied by this vector gives:

(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) =12 i² =12*(-1) =-12.

Second term:4*(-3)= -12.

So the sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Now multiply by (1/25) and (ħ/2).

So the expectation value is (1/25)* (-24) * (ħ/2).

Wait, no. Because the entire calculation is (1/25) times [ -3i * (-4i) +4*(-3) ] which is (1/25) * (-24) ), and then multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try again.

Wait, the expression is ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5)^2 * [ (-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3) ] * (ħ/2).

Which is (1/25) * (-24) * (ħ/2).

Wait, that gives ( (-24) /25 ) * (ħ/2 ) = ( -24 ħ )/(50 ) = (-12 ħ )/(25 ).

Which is -12 ħ /25. So that's option A.

Wait, so earlier I forgot to normalize the state, which changed the result. So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25, which is option A.

So the answer should be A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the State**:  
   The given state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm of the state is computed as:  
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
   \]  
   Therefore, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Matrix for \( S_y \)**:  
   The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is given as:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to \( \sigma_y \) by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value Formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \cdot S_y \cdot \psi_{\text{normalized}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), we get:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \cdot \sigma_y \cdot \psi_{\text{normalized}}.
   \]

4. **Matrix Multiplication**:  
   First, compute \( \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \cdot \sigma_y \):  
   \[
   \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Multiplying \( \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \) with \( \sigma_y \):  
   \[
   \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \cdot \sigma_y = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Next, multiply this result with \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \):  
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \cdot \sigma_y \cdot \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Compute the dot product:  
   \[
   4i \cdot 3i + (-3) \cdot 4 = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]  
   Therefore:  
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{1}{25} \cdot (-24) = -\frac{24}{25}.
   \]

5. **Final Expectation Value**:  
   Substituting \( \langle \sigma_y \rangle \) into \( \langle S_y \rangle \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
