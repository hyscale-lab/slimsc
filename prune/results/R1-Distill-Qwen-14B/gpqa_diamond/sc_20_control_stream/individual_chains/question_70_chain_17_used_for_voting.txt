Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the point groups in molecular symmetry. So each point group corresponds to a particular arrangement of atoms in a molecule, which affects its physical properties like how it interacts with light.

Alright, let me start by breaking down the reactions given in the problem.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking about what kind of reaction that would be. 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio where B is in a high quantity. Maybe B is something like O2 or Cl2? Because those are diatomic gases. And A could be a metal perhaps, like iron or copper? But wait, the product is bright red. Bright red solids are often things like iron(III) oxide, but more commonly, I'm thinking of compounds like CuO or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal compound. Hmm, if A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas, perhaps they're forming a metal oxide.

Wait, but after that, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D could be something like chlorine or fluorine, but E being hazardous... like maybe a highly toxic gas? Or perhaps a dangerous compound like phosgene, but that's more of a gas. Alternatively, E might be a highly reactive compound, maybe something like a peroxide or a cyanide. Wait, but another thought: if C is a metal oxide and reacts with D to form something else. Let's not get stuck here yet.

The next part says C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. That's interesting. So when C (maybe an oxide) reacts with water, it forms the original metal (A) and two acids. So, for example, if C is a metal oxide, it could be reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide, which then might decompose further. Wait, but if two acids are formed, how does that work?

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that, when reacted with water, forms a corresponding acid. But if it's a basic oxide, it would form a base. Hmm, perhaps C is a mixed oxide? Or maybe it's a transition metal oxide that can form different types of acids when reacted with water.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives acids. Wait, but the product is A plus two acids. So maybe A is the metal, and the oxide (C) when reacted with water forms the metal and some acid. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because oxides reacting with water usually form hydroxides, not metals. Unless it's a very high reactivity scenario. Or perhaps the oxide is of a non-metal, but that would produce an acid when reacted with water.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the reactions step by step.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
Second: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
Third: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G is weak acid)
Fourth: D + B → H (solvent)

Let me try to assign possible substances.

Starting with reaction four: D + B → H (a solvent). So D and B are gases that react to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But D and B are gases, so maybe H is something like HCl (but HCl is a gas, not a solvent). Or maybe H is something like NH3, but that's also a gas. Wait, unless H is a liquid solvent under certain conditions. Maybe D is Cl2 and B is something else. Wait, let me think again.

Another approach: Let's consider what H could be. Since H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like H2O, but then D and B would have to be O2 and H2, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol, but that's not made from two gases in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: H is used as a solvent. What are common solvents made from gas reactions? Maybe H is HCl gas? But wait, HCl is a gas at room temperature. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas too. Or perhaps H is a more complex solvent like something made from CO and H2, such as methanol or something?

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diatomic molecule that's a solvent. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the other reactions first.

Let's go back to reaction three: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C (oxide) reacts with water, it produces the metal (A) and two acids. Wait, but that would imply that the oxide is being reduced or something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, and when reacted with water, it produces CO2 and the metal hydroxide. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it forms the corresponding base (hydroxide) and then perhaps that base decomposes further. But the problem states that it produces A plus two acids. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, and when it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (a strong base, not acid) and O2. But that doesn't fit either.

Another thought: Perhaps C is a salt that when it reacts with water, undergoes hydrolysis to form acids. For example, maybe C is a nitrate salt, but that's not likely to form two acids. Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal bicarbonate? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. Hmm, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly.

Let me try to think about the possible substances in each reaction.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (hazardous)
Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent)

So, let's try to figure out what each substance could be.

First, reaction 4: D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, possible combinations could be:

Looking for two gases reacting to form a solvent. Let's think of possible gas pairs and their products.

If B is O2 and D is H2, their reaction would form H2O, which is a solvent. But that's a 2:1 ratio (2H2 + O2 → 2H2O). So that doesn't fit 1:1. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2 and D is O2, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, D is Cl2 and B is another gas. For example, B could be O2 and D is F2, but O2 + F2 doesn't react under normal conditions, I think. Or perhaps B is O2 and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else, but NH3 is a gas but not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water forms a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that upon hydrolysis yields two acids.

Wait, maybe C is an anhydride. For example, if C is a carbonate, but that would produce bicarbonate and CO2, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, C could be a nitride, which upon hydrolysis would produce NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But that might not give acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If C is a chloride of a metal that when it reacts with water, it forms a strong acid and a weak acid. Like, perhaps, if C is a chloro compound that's acidic. Wait, maybe C is a chlorate or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. No, that's a neutral salt. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product when C reacts with water is a metal and two acids. So, for example, maybe C is a metal oxide that when it reacts with water produces a metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid. But that seems a bit odd. Wait, unless the oxide is something like a mixed oxide that can produce two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. Wait, but carbonate reacting with water would produce bicarbonate and CO2. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: What if C is a metal nitride? For example, Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like Cl2O7 (chlorine pentafluoride?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe D is Cl2 and E is something like ClO2, which is a toxic gas. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. But how would that form from C and D?

Wait, let me think about reaction 2 again. C is reacting with 2 D to form E. And reaction 4 says D and B form H, which is a solvent.

So if B is O2 and D is Cl2, then H would be HCl (a gas, not a solvent). Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, H would be H2O, which is a solvent. But D is a gas. So when B (O2) and D (H2) react in 1:1 ratio, they form H2O. But the ratio for that reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of D as a diatomic gas and B as another diatomic gas. Let's think of H as a solvent, perhaps something like H2O, which is a solvent. So if D is H2 and B is O2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But again, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is F2 and B is something else. But F2 is a highly reactive gas. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Let me think about the reactions again. Maybe I should look for a substance that when reacted with 8 equivalents of another forms a bright red product. Hmm, bright red could be something like CuO, but I don't think that's bright red. Wait, maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur (solid) reacts with something to form C. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Fe + O2 → Fe3O4? But Fe3O4 is black, not bright red.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is Cu, and B is O2. But copper oxide is black or red, but I'm not sure. Wait, CuO is black, but perhaps Cu2O is red. Yes! Cu2O is a bright red solid. So if A is copper metal, B is oxygen (O2). So the reaction would be 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But wait, if it's 8 equivalents of B, which is O2, that would mean more O. Hmm, perhaps it's a different stoichiometry.

Wait, Cu2O has the formula CuO·Cu(OH)₂, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be 2 Cu + 1.5 O2 → 2 CuO. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. So if A is Cu (1 mole), then 8 moles of O2 would produce more than 2 moles of CuO. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is S. But FeS is not bright red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is Pb and B is O2. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown. Not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking of a different reaction. Let me think about a reaction that produces a bright red solid when a metal reacts with a gas.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving transition metals. Another thought: perhaps C is Mn2O7, but that's dark brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? No, that's usually not bright red.

Wait, another angle: What about a reaction where solid A is sodium, and B is chlorine gas. Sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. But NaCl is white, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is phosphorus and B is something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the bright red product is a nitride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should pivot and look at the other reactions to get more clues.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So when C reacts with water, it forms A, which is the original solid, and two acids.

Wait, that suggests that C is an oxide of A, perhaps. Because when the oxide reacts with water, it forms the metal (but that would require a reduction, which is a bit odd) and the corresponding acid. Wait, but how does that work? For example, if A is Fe, and C is FeO, then FeO + H2O would form Fe(OH)2, which then oxidizes to Fe(OH)3. But that doesn't fit the scenario here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a carbonate. For instance, if C is CaCO3, then reacting with water wouldn't produce a metal. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but again, that's not likely to produce a metal upon hydrolysis.

Wait, maybe C is a hydroxide. For example, if A is Al, and C is Al(OH)3. But then, Al(OH)3 is amphoteric; it can react with acids or bases. But when it reacts with water, it might not produce anything else except maybe some weak acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Maybe H is a diatomic molecule that's a solvent, like H2O. But as I thought before, that would require D and B to be H2 and O2, which react in a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that's a problem.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is something like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), but that's not a product of two gases. Alternatively, H could be something like methanol, but I'm not sure how that would form from two gases.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3, but that wouldn't be a solvent in the same way. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), but that's a liquid. But how would D and B form that? Maybe D is CO and B is H2. Then, under certain conditions, they could form methanol, but that's probably a stretch. Also, the ratio would need to be 1:1. CO + H2 → CH3OH, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about D as a diatomic gas like F2 or Cl2, but then what would B be? Let's say B is O2. So F2 + O2 → H? No, that's Ozone, which is a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O, but as discussed earlier, the stoichiometry doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possible structures of E which would have the given molecular symmetry groups.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. So, these are all point groups. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry planes, like CO2 (but CO2 is D∞h, wait no, CO2 is D∞h? Wait, no, CO2 is linear with D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, actually, CO2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, but that's a gas, but the question says E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, but CO2 is not extremely hazardous in normal concentrations, though in high concentrations it can cause asphyxiation.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like SO2, which is a toxic gas. SO2 has a bent structure, so its point group would be C2v because it has a center of inversion and a C2 axis with two perpendicular mirror planes. Wait, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2 axis (through the sulfur atom and the midpoint between the oxygens) and mirror planes. So its point group is C2v. So the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. SO2 has a bent structure, which is similar to water. H2O has C2v symmetry. So yes, SO2 would have C2v symmetry. If that's the case, the answer would be D) C2v.

But how does that fit with the reactions?

So, if E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So C would be something that when reacted with D in 2 equivalents forms SO2.

Also, reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Let's say H is H2O. Then, D and B would have to be gases that react to form H2O. So D and B could be H2 and O2. But as before, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1 ratio, but reaction 4 requires 1:1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else. Let me think: if H is H2O, then D and B would be H2 and O2, but the stoichiometry doesn't match. So maybe H isn't H2O.

Another possibility: If H is NH3 (though it's a gas, but it's a solvent in some contexts), then D and B would have to be gases that react to form NH3. So maybe D is N2 and B is H2. But the reaction would be N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, which is a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and B is another gas. Wait, I'm stuck on this part.

Alternatively, let's re-examine the first reaction. If A is Cu, and B is O2, then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with Cu would form CuO or Cu2O. But the product C is bright red, so maybe Cu2O.

So reaction 1: Cu + 8 O2 → Cu2O? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the stoichiometry for Cu forming Cu2O would be 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But that's not matching the 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe A is Fe and B is S. Fe reacts with S to form FeS, which is black, not red.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the reaction that produces E (extremely hazardous) when C reacts with D.

If E is SO2, then C would have to be something that when reacted with D (maybe S?) produces SO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure with a central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. That structure is trigonal planar, which has D3h symmetry. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCN, which is a toxic gas. HCN has a linear structure (H-C≡N), so its point group would be D∞h, which is option C. But I'm not sure if that fits the other reactions.

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → HCN. So D would be something like CN- but that's not a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and C is a compound containing CN. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, but that's a highly reactive and toxic gas. ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule, so its point group is C3v, which isn't one of the options. So that's probably not it.

Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Let's think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, when C reacts with water, it produces the original metal (A) and two acids.

Wait a minute, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, if A is Na, and C is Na2CO3. Then Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH (strong base) + CO2 (weak acid). But the problem says F and G are acids, so this doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, but that also wouldn't produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a hydroxide that decomposes. For example, if C is NaOH, but that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base, not an oxide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and a weak acid. Let me think of a metal oxide that can produce two different acids. For example, maybe C is a mixed oxide. Hmm, like PbO2, which reacts with water to form PbO2 (which is a strong oxidizing agent) and H2O2. But H2O2 is a weak acid. Wait, but how would that fit into the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide of a transition metal that can form multiple acids upon hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is CrO3. CrO3 is a strong oxidizing agent and reacts with water to form H2CrO4 (a strong acid) and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, then Na2O2 + H2O → 2 NaOH + O2. But that's a base and O2 gas. Doesn't fit because F and G are acids.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps F is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and G is H2CO3 (carbonic acid). But how would that form from C and water?

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if C is CaSO3, then reacting with water could form H2SO3 (which is H2SO3, a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids, but here Ca(OH)2 is a base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrite. For example, Ca(NO2)2. Reacting with water might form HNO2 (a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2, which is a base. Again, doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit frustrating. Let me think about the possible structures of E again. The options are symmetry groups, so maybe E has a linear structure, trigonal planar, or something else.

If E has D∞h symmetry, that suggests a linear molecule with multiple planes of symmetry. For example, O2, CO2, NO2 (but NO2 is bent, so D∞h doesn't fit). Wait, NO2 has a bent structure and is V-shaped, so its point group is C2v. Hmm.

Wait, another compound with D∞h symmetry is the carbonate ion (CO3^2-), which is trigonal planar. But E is a product of C and D, which are reactants in a reaction, so E is a neutral molecule, probably.

Wait, another linear molecule is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure if that fits the reactions.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxyheptachloride?), no, that's not a real compound. Wait, Cl2O7 is a real compound. Cl2O7 is a toxic gas, I think. Its structure is OCl2Cl2O, which is linear, so its point group would be D∞h. Hmm.

But how would Cl2O7 form from C and D?

Wait, reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. So if E is Cl2O7, then D would be Cl2 and C would be O2? But O2 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm, but in reaction 1, C is a product of solid A and gas B. So if C is O2, that doesn't fit because O2 is a gas, but C is a bright red solid. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and D is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry. Let me go back to that.

If E is SO2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → SO2.

So, what could C and D be? Let me think. SO2 is formed from the combustion of sulfur. So, for instance, if D is O2 and C is S (solid sulfur), then S + 2 O2 → SO2 + O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound containing S and D is O2. Hmm.

Wait, but in reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red). If C is SO3, which is a liquid or solid, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, if C is Cu2O, which is bright red.

So, reaction 1: A (Cu) + 8 B (O2) → Cu2O (bright red).

But wait, the reaction for forming Cu2O would be 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But that's just black oxide, not red. Wait, wait, maybe the reaction is under different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like 2 Cu + ½ O2 → CuO (black). Hmm, not matching the red color.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the bright red product is FeO·nH2O (a form of iron oxide hydroxide), but I'm not certain about its color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think of possible reactions where a solid metal reacts with a gas to form a bright red product.

Another thought: Maybe A is lead (Pb) and B is oxygen. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown, so that's not red.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is a sulfide. For example, CdS is bright yellow, but maybe another sulfide is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bright red product is a chromium compound. For example, Cr2O3 is green, but maybe some other chromium compound is red.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound, but I don't recall any bright red manganese oxides.

Another angle: Let's think about reaction 3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if C is a metal oxide, perhaps of a Group 2 metal. For example, if C is CaO, then CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a non-metal oxide. For instance, if C is CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a superoxide. For example, KO2 (which is a dark green solid). When KO2 reacts with water, it produces O2, KOH, and H2O2. So, KOH is a strong base, not an acid. But the problem states F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again. If E has a symmetry group of D∞h, it's linear with multiple planes. If E is a linear molecule like O2 or CO2, then its symmetry group would be D∞h. But O2 is diatomic, so its point group is D∞h. So if E is O2, but O2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous. Wait, but O2 is a gas, but it's not extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations. Alternatively, maybe E is another diatomic gas.

Wait, but if E is O2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2. That doesn't make sense because O2 is the product, but in reaction 4, D and B form H. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is a triatomic molecule, like SO3, which has D3h symmetry. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, like SO2. SO2 has a bent structure with a central S atom and two O atoms. So its point group is C2v. So if E is SO2, then the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

If E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So C and D must be reactants that form SO2. Maybe D is O2 and C is S. So reaction 2 would be S + 2 O2 → SO2. But that doesn't balance. The balanced equation is S + O2 → SO2 (1:1 ratio). So that doesn't fit the 2 equivalents of D.

Alternatively, perhaps C is another form of sulfur, like CS2 or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reaction 2 would be FeS + 2 D → SO2. But I'm not sure what D would be.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. Let me think. If C is CaSO3, then reaction with D could be something like CaSO3 + 2 H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid, and maybe another acid. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Let me try to summarize what I've got so far.

Based on the reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent)

I'm trying to find E's molecular symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D.

Alternatively, if E is HCN with D∞h symmetry, the answer is C. But I'm not sure.

Let me think again about reaction 4. If D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's assume H is H2O. Then D and B would have to be H2 and O2, but the stoichiometry doesn't fit. So H can't be H2O.

Another idea: Maybe H is NH3, which is a solvent. Then D and B could be N2 and H2. But the reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, which is 1:3 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps reaction 4 is D + B → H, which is a diatomic molecule. For example, D is H2 and B is F2. Then H would be HF, which is a solvent. But the reaction would be H2 + F2 → 2 HF. That's a 1:1 ratio. Oh, wait, no, the stoichiometry is 1:1 to produce 2 HF. So the reaction would be H2 + F2 → 2 HF. But the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So moles-wise, it's 1 mole D + 1 mole B → 1 mole H. But H is HF, which would require 1 H2 + 1 F2 → 2 HF. So that's a 1:1 mole ratio for D and B, but produces 2 moles of H. Hmm, but the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, so maybe that's acceptable.

In that case, D is H2, B is F2, and H is HF.

Wait, but then looking at reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (F2) → C (bright red). So A is a metal that reacts with F2 to form a bright red product. Hmm, metals reacting with F2 often form MF2 or MF3 compounds. For example, Cu reacts with F2 to form CuF2 or CuF3. Wait, but what color is CuF2? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another thought: If A is S, and B is F2. Then S + F2 → SF2 or SF4 or SF6. SF6 is a colorless gas, SF4 is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure about their colors. Alternatively, reaction 1 would produce C, which is bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a bright red fluoride. For example, maybe Cu reacts with F2 to form CuF2, which is... I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Hmm. This is taking a while, but I think I need to make an educated guess based on the information.

Given the options for E's symmetry group, if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D) C2v.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like O2 or CO2, which have D∞h symmetry, then the answer could be C) D∞h.

But given the reactions, especially reaction 3, which produces two acids, I'm more inclined to think that E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry.

So, putting it all together, I think the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like Cu₂O (copper(I,II) oxide), which is red. If A is copper and B is oxygen, the reaction could be 2 Cu + O₂ → 2 CuO, but the exact stoichiometry is unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. If E is SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), a toxic gas, this would fit the description. SO₂ has a bent structure with C₂v symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is Cu₂O, it could react with water to form Cu (A) and two acids, though the specific acids are not detailed.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If D is H₂ and B is O₂, H could be H₂O, but the stoichiometry does not match. Other possibilities for H include NH₃ or CH₃OH, but the exact identity remains unclear.

Given the options for molecular symmetry groups, SO₂ (C₂v symmetry) aligns with the description of E as a toxic gas. Other possibilities, such as O₂ (D∞h symmetry), do not fit the reactions or the description of E as extremely hazardous. Thus, the most consistent answer is that E has C₂v symmetry.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the point groups in molecular symmetry. So each point group corresponds to a particular arrangement of atoms in a molecule, which affects its physical properties like how it interacts with light.

Alright, let me start by breaking down the reactions given in the problem.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking about what kind of reaction that would be. 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio where B is in a high quantity. Maybe B is something like O2 or Cl2? Because those are diatomic gases. And A could be a metal perhaps, like iron or copper? But wait, the product is bright red. Bright red solids are often things like iron(III) oxide, but more commonly, I'm thinking of compounds like CuO or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal compound. Hmm, if A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas, perhaps they're forming a metal oxide.

Wait, but after that, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D could be something like chlorine or fluorine, but E being hazardous... like maybe a highly toxic gas? Or perhaps a dangerous compound like phosgene, but that's more of a gas. Alternatively, E might be a highly reactive compound, maybe something like a peroxide or a cyanide. Wait, but another thought: if C is a metal oxide and reacts with D to form something else. Let's not get stuck here yet.

The next part says C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. That's interesting. So when C (maybe an oxide) reacts with water, it forms the original metal (A) and two acids. So, for example, if C is a metal oxide, it could be reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide, which then might decompose further. Wait, but if two acids are formed, how does that work?

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that, when reacted with water, forms a corresponding acid. But if it's a basic oxide, it would form a base. Hmm, perhaps C is a mixed oxide? Or maybe it's a transition metal oxide that can form different types of acids when reacted with water.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives acids. Wait, but the product is A plus two acids. So maybe A is the metal, and the oxide (C) when reacted with water forms the metal and some acid. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because oxides reacting with water usually form hydroxides, not metals. Unless it's a very high reactivity scenario. Or perhaps the oxide is of a non-metal, but that would produce an acid when reacted with water.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the reactions step by step.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
Second: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
Third: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G is weak acid)
Fourth: D + B → H (solvent)

Let me try to assign possible substances.

Starting with reaction four: D + B → H (a solvent). So D and B are gases that react to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But D and B are gases, so maybe H is something like HCl (but HCl is a gas, not a solvent). Or maybe H is something like NH3, but that's also a gas. Wait, unless H is a liquid solvent under certain conditions. Maybe D is Cl2 and B is something else. Wait, let me think again.

Another approach: Let's consider what H could be. Since H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like H2O, but then D and B would have to be O2 and H2, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol, but that's not made from two gases in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: H is used as a solvent. What are common solvents made from gas reactions? Maybe H is HCl gas? But wait, HCl is a gas at room temperature. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas too. Or perhaps H is a more complex solvent like something made from CO and H2, such as methanol or something?

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diatomic molecule that's a solvent. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the other reactions first.

Let's go back to reaction three: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C (oxide) reacts with water, it produces the metal (A) and two acids. Wait, but that would imply that the oxide is being reduced or something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, and when reacted with water, it produces CO2 and the metal hydroxide. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it forms the corresponding base (hydroxide) and then perhaps that base decomposes further. But the problem states that it produces A plus two acids. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, and when it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (a strong base, not acid) and O2. But that doesn't fit either.

Another thought: Perhaps C is a salt that when it reacts with water, undergoes hydrolysis to form acids. For example, maybe C is a nitrate salt, but that's not likely to form two acids. Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal bicarbonate? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed oxide. Hmm, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly.

Let me try to think about the possible substances in each reaction.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (hazardous)
Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent)

So, let's try to figure out what each substance could be.

First, reaction 4: D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, possible combinations could be:

Looking for two gases reacting to form a solvent. Let's think of possible gas pairs and their products.

If B is O2 and D is H2, their reaction would form H2O, which is a solvent. But that's a 2:1 ratio (2H2 + O2 → 2H2O). So that doesn't fit 1:1. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is something else.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2 and D is O2, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, D is Cl2 and B is another gas. For example, B could be O2 and D is F2, but O2 + F2 doesn't react under normal conditions, I think. Or perhaps B is O2 and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else, but NH3 is a gas but not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about reaction 3. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water forms a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that upon hydrolysis yields two acids.

Wait, maybe C is an anhydride. For example, if C is a carbonate, but that would produce bicarbonate and CO2, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, C could be a nitride, which upon hydrolysis would produce NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But that might not give acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If C is a chloride of a metal that when it reacts with water, it forms a strong acid and a weak acid. Like, perhaps, if C is a chloro compound that's acidic. Wait, maybe C is a chlorate or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. No, that's a neutral salt. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product when C reacts with water is a metal and two acids. So, for example, maybe C is a metal oxide that when it reacts with water produces a metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid. But that seems a bit odd. Wait, unless the oxide is something like a mixed oxide that can produce two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. Wait, but carbonate reacting with water would produce bicarbonate and CO2. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: What if C is a metal nitride? For example, Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like Cl2O7 (chlorine pentafluoride?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe D is Cl2 and E is something like ClO2, which is a toxic gas. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. But how would that form from C and D?

Wait, let me think about reaction 2 again. C is reacting with 2 D to form E. And reaction 4 says D and B form H, which is a solvent.

So if B is O2 and D is Cl2, then H would be HCl (a gas, not a solvent). Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, H would be H2O, which is a solvent. But D is a gas. So when B (O2) and D (H2) react in 1:1 ratio, they form H2O. But the ratio for that reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of D as a diatomic gas and B as another diatomic gas. Let's think of H as a solvent, perhaps something like H2O, which is a solvent. So if D is H2 and B is O2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But again, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is F2 and B is something else. But F2 is a highly reactive gas. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Let me think about the reactions again. Maybe I should look for a substance that when reacted with 8 equivalents of another forms a bright red product. Hmm, bright red could be something like CuO, but I don't think that's bright red. Wait, maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur (solid) reacts with something to form C. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is O2. Fe + O2 → Fe3O4? But Fe3O4 is black, not bright red.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is Cu, and B is O2. But copper oxide is black or red, but I'm not sure. Wait, CuO is black, but perhaps Cu2O is red. Yes! Cu2O is a bright red solid. So if A is copper metal, B is oxygen (O2). So the reaction would be 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But wait, if it's 8 equivalents of B, which is O2, that would mean more O. Hmm, perhaps it's a different stoichiometry.

Wait, Cu2O has the formula CuO·Cu(OH)₂, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be 2 Cu + 1.5 O2 → 2 CuO. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of A. So if A is Cu (1 mole), then 8 moles of O2 would produce more than 2 moles of CuO. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is S. But FeS is not bright red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is Pb and B is O2. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown. Not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking of a different reaction. Let me think about a reaction that produces a bright red solid when a metal reacts with a gas.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving transition metals. Another thought: perhaps C is Mn2O7, but that's dark brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? No, that's usually not bright red.

Wait, another angle: What about a reaction where solid A is sodium, and B is chlorine gas. Sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. But NaCl is white, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is phosphorus and B is something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the bright red product is a nitride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should pivot and look at the other reactions to get more clues.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So when C reacts with water, it forms A, which is the original solid, and two acids.

Wait, that suggests that C is an oxide of A, perhaps. Because when the oxide reacts with water, it forms the metal (but that would require a reduction, which is a bit odd) and the corresponding acid. Wait, but how does that work? For example, if A is Fe, and C is FeO, then FeO + H2O would form Fe(OH)2, which then oxidizes to Fe(OH)3. But that doesn't fit the scenario here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a carbonate. For instance, if C is CaCO3, then reacting with water wouldn't produce a metal. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but again, that's not likely to produce a metal upon hydrolysis.

Wait, maybe C is a hydroxide. For example, if A is Al, and C is Al(OH)3. But then, Al(OH)3 is amphoteric; it can react with acids or bases. But when it reacts with water, it might not produce anything else except maybe some weak acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Maybe H is a diatomic molecule that's a solvent, like H2O. But as I thought before, that would require D and B to be H2 and O2, which react in a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that's a problem.

Wait, another thought: Maybe H is something like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), but that's not a product of two gases. Alternatively, H could be something like methanol, but I'm not sure how that would form from two gases.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3, but that wouldn't be a solvent in the same way. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), but that's a liquid. But how would D and B form that? Maybe D is CO and B is H2. Then, under certain conditions, they could form methanol, but that's probably a stretch. Also, the ratio would need to be 1:1. CO + H2 → CH3OH, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about D as a diatomic gas like F2 or Cl2, but then what would B be? Let's say B is O2. So F2 + O2 → H? No, that's Ozone, which is a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O, but as discussed earlier, the stoichiometry doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possible structures of E which would have the given molecular symmetry groups.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. So, these are all point groups. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry planes, like CO2 (but CO2 is D∞h, wait no, CO2 is D∞h? Wait, no, CO2 is linear with D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, actually, CO2 has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, but that's a gas, but the question says E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, but CO2 is not extremely hazardous in normal concentrations, though in high concentrations it can cause asphyxiation.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like SO2, which is a toxic gas. SO2 has a bent structure, so its point group would be C2v because it has a center of inversion and a C2 axis with two perpendicular mirror planes. Wait, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2 axis (through the sulfur atom and the midpoint between the oxygens) and mirror planes. So its point group is C2v. So the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. SO2 has a bent structure, which is similar to water. H2O has C2v symmetry. So yes, SO2 would have C2v symmetry. If that's the case, the answer would be D) C2v.

But how does that fit with the reactions?

So, if E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So C would be something that when reacted with D in 2 equivalents forms SO2.

Also, reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Let's say H is H2O. Then, D and B would have to be gases that react to form H2O. So D and B could be H2 and O2. But as before, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is 2:1 ratio, but reaction 4 requires 1:1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else. Let me think: if H is H2O, then D and B would be H2 and O2, but the stoichiometry doesn't match. So maybe H isn't H2O.

Another possibility: If H is NH3 (though it's a gas, but it's a solvent in some contexts), then D and B would have to be gases that react to form NH3. So maybe D is N2 and B is H2. But the reaction would be N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, which is a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and B is another gas. Wait, I'm stuck on this part.

Alternatively, let's re-examine the first reaction. If A is Cu, and B is O2, then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with Cu would form CuO or Cu2O. But the product C is bright red, so maybe Cu2O.

So reaction 1: Cu + 8 O2 → Cu2O? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the stoichiometry for Cu forming Cu2O would be 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But that's not matching the 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe A is Fe and B is S. Fe reacts with S to form FeS, which is black, not red.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the reaction that produces E (extremely hazardous) when C reacts with D.

If E is SO2, then C would have to be something that when reacted with D (maybe S?) produces SO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure with a central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. That structure is trigonal planar, which has D3h symmetry. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCN, which is a toxic gas. HCN has a linear structure (H-C≡N), so its point group would be D∞h, which is option C. But I'm not sure if that fits the other reactions.

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → HCN. So D would be something like CN- but that's not a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and C is a compound containing CN. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, but that's a highly reactive and toxic gas. ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule, so its point group is C3v, which isn't one of the options. So that's probably not it.

Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Let's think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, when C reacts with water, it produces the original metal (A) and two acids.

Wait a minute, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, if A is Na, and C is Na2CO3. Then Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH (strong base) + CO2 (weak acid). But the problem says F and G are acids, so this doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, but that also wouldn't produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a hydroxide that decomposes. For example, if C is NaOH, but that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base, not an oxide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and a weak acid. Let me think of a metal oxide that can produce two different acids. For example, maybe C is a mixed oxide. Hmm, like PbO2, which reacts with water to form PbO2 (which is a strong oxidizing agent) and H2O2. But H2O2 is a weak acid. Wait, but how would that fit into the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide of a transition metal that can form multiple acids upon hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is CrO3. CrO3 is a strong oxidizing agent and reacts with water to form H2CrO4 (a strong acid) and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, then Na2O2 + H2O → 2 NaOH + O2. But that's a base and O2 gas. Doesn't fit because F and G are acids.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps F is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and G is H2CO3 (carbonic acid). But how would that form from C and water?

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if C is CaSO3, then reacting with water could form H2SO3 (which is H2SO3, a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids, but here Ca(OH)2 is a base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrite. For example, Ca(NO2)2. Reacting with water might form HNO2 (a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2, which is a base. Again, doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit frustrating. Let me think about the possible structures of E again. The options are symmetry groups, so maybe E has a linear structure, trigonal planar, or something else.

If E has D∞h symmetry, that suggests a linear molecule with multiple planes of symmetry. For example, O2, CO2, NO2 (but NO2 is bent, so D∞h doesn't fit). Wait, NO2 has a bent structure and is V-shaped, so its point group is C2v. Hmm.

Wait, another compound with D∞h symmetry is the carbonate ion (CO3^2-), which is trigonal planar. But E is a product of C and D, which are reactants in a reaction, so E is a neutral molecule, probably.

Wait, another linear molecule is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. But I'm not sure if that fits the reactions.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxyheptachloride?), no, that's not a real compound. Wait, Cl2O7 is a real compound. Cl2O7 is a toxic gas, I think. Its structure is OCl2Cl2O, which is linear, so its point group would be D∞h. Hmm.

But how would Cl2O7 form from C and D?

Wait, reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. So if E is Cl2O7, then D would be Cl2 and C would be O2? But O2 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm, but in reaction 1, C is a product of solid A and gas B. So if C is O2, that doesn't fit because O2 is a gas, but C is a bright red solid. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and D is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry. Let me go back to that.

If E is SO2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → SO2.

So, what could C and D be? Let me think. SO2 is formed from the combustion of sulfur. So, for instance, if D is O2 and C is S (solid sulfur), then S + 2 O2 → SO2 + O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound containing S and D is O2. Hmm.

Wait, but in reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red). If C is SO3, which is a liquid or solid, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, if C is Cu2O, which is bright red.

So, reaction 1: A (Cu) + 8 B (O2) → Cu2O (bright red).

But wait, the reaction for forming Cu2O would be 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. But that's just black oxide, not red. Wait, wait, maybe the reaction is under different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like 2 Cu + ½ O2 → CuO (black). Hmm, not matching the red color.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the bright red product is FeO·nH2O (a form of iron oxide hydroxide), but I'm not certain about its color.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think of possible reactions where a solid metal reacts with a gas to form a bright red product.

Another thought: Maybe A is lead (Pb) and B is oxygen. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown, so that's not red.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is a sulfide. For example, CdS is bright yellow, but maybe another sulfide is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bright red product is a chromium compound. For example, Cr2O3 is green, but maybe some other chromium compound is red.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound, but I don't recall any bright red manganese oxides.

Another angle: Let's think about reaction 3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if C is a metal oxide, perhaps of a Group 2 metal. For example, if C is CaO, then CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a non-metal oxide. For instance, if C is CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a superoxide. For example, KO2 (which is a dark green solid). When KO2 reacts with water, it produces O2, KOH, and H2O2. So, KOH is a strong base, not an acid. But the problem states F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures again. If E has a symmetry group of D∞h, it's linear with multiple planes. If E is a linear molecule like O2 or CO2, then its symmetry group would be D∞h. But O2 is diatomic, so its point group is D∞h. So if E is O2, but O2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous. Wait, but O2 is a gas, but it's not extremely hazardous unless in high concentrations. Alternatively, maybe E is another diatomic gas.

Wait, but if E is O2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2. That doesn't make sense because O2 is the product, but in reaction 4, D and B form H. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is a triatomic molecule, like SO3, which has D3h symmetry. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, like SO2. SO2 has a bent structure with a central S atom and two O atoms. So its point group is C2v. So if E is SO2, then the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

If E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So C and D must be reactants that form SO2. Maybe D is O2 and C is S. So reaction 2 would be S + 2 O2 → SO2. But that doesn't balance. The balanced equation is S + O2 → SO2 (1:1 ratio). So that doesn't fit the 2 equivalents of D.

Alternatively, perhaps C is another form of sulfur, like CS2 or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reaction 2 would be FeS + 2 D → SO2. But I'm not sure what D would be.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. Let me think. If C is CaSO3, then reaction with D could be something like CaSO3 + 2 H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid, and maybe another acid. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Let me try to summarize what I've got so far.

Based on the reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent)

I'm trying to find E's molecular symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D.

Alternatively, if E is HCN with D∞h symmetry, the answer is C. But I'm not sure.

Let me think again about reaction 4. If D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's assume H is H2O. Then D and B would have to be H2 and O2, but the stoichiometry doesn't fit. So H can't be H2O.

Another idea: Maybe H is NH3, which is a solvent. Then D and B could be N2 and H2. But the reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, which is 1:3 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps reaction 4 is D + B → H, which is a diatomic molecule. For example, D is H2 and B is F2. Then H would be HF, which is a solvent. But the reaction would be H2 + F2 → 2 HF. That's a 1:1 ratio. Oh, wait, no, the stoichiometry is 1:1 to produce 2 HF. So the reaction would be H2 + F2 → 2 HF. But the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So moles-wise, it's 1 mole D + 1 mole B → 1 mole H. But H is HF, which would require 1 H2 + 1 F2 → 2 HF. So that's a 1:1 mole ratio for D and B, but produces 2 moles of H. Hmm, but the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, so maybe that's acceptable.

In that case, D is H2, B is F2, and H is HF.

Wait, but then looking at reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (F2) → C (bright red). So A is a metal that reacts with F2 to form a bright red product. Hmm, metals reacting with F2 often form MF2 or MF3 compounds. For example, Cu reacts with F2 to form CuF2 or CuF3. Wait, but what color is CuF2? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another thought: If A is S, and B is F2. Then S + F2 → SF2 or SF4 or SF6. SF6 is a colorless gas, SF4 is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure about their colors. Alternatively, reaction 1 would produce C, which is bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a bright red fluoride. For example, maybe Cu reacts with F2 to form CuF2, which is... I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Hmm. This is taking a while, but I think I need to make an educated guess based on the information.

Given the options for E's symmetry group, if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be D) C2v.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like O2 or CO2, which have D∞h symmetry, then the answer could be C) D∞h.

But given the reactions, especially reaction 3, which produces two acids, I'm more inclined to think that E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry.

So, putting it all together, I think the molecular symmetry group of E is C2v, option D.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like Cu₂O (copper(I,II) oxide), which is red. If A is copper and B is oxygen, the reaction could be 2 Cu + O₂ → 2 CuO, but the exact stoichiometry is unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. If E is SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), a toxic gas, this would fit the description. SO₂ has a bent structure with C₂v symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is Cu₂O, it could react with water to form Cu (A) and two acids, though the specific acids are not detailed.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If D is H₂ and B is O₂, H could be H₂O, but the stoichiometry does not match. Other possibilities for H include NH₃ or CH₃OH, but the exact identity remains unclear.

Given the options for molecular symmetry groups, SO₂ (C₂v symmetry) aligns with the description of E as a toxic gas. Other possibilities, such as O₂ (D∞h symmetry), do not fit the reactions or the description of E as extremely hazardous. Thus, the most consistent answer is that E has C₂v symmetry.

Answer: D
