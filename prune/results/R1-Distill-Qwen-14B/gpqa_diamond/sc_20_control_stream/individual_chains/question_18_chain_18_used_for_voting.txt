Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. The data are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=10^-5

The question is: what's the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2? So, (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2)?

The options are A to D, with numbers like ~3.9, ~12.6, etc. Hmm.

Wait, I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star because the ratio of silicon would depend on their [Si/H] values. Then I can compare them to get the ratio.

Let me think about the given data. For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as solar. So [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe,nH)_sun. Wait, no, I think [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, actually, the notation [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) relative to the Sun. So for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) =0 → So their ratio is the same as solar.

Which means n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = 10^([Fe/H}_1 + log(nFe/nH)_sun )

Wait, no, wait. Because [Fe/H]_1 is defined as log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 0 → So log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) = log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

But in the Sun, n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5), since from the data 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH) is -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 means Fe abundance is same as Sun, so n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) → n_Fe1 = n_H1 * 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → same as Sun, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = 1e-5 (since in Sun, nMg/nH=1e-5).

Wait, but for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → which is log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know the solar [Mg/Si]. Let me think.

Wait, I need to find the [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratio.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, for Star 1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. That is, log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) )=0.3.

Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So,

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

What's the solar ratio n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun? Let's compute.

In the Sun, n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun = (n_Si_sun) / (n_Fe_sun).

But wait, I don't have the solar [Si/Fe] value given. Oh wait, I can compute it.

In the Sun, n_Si = (n_Si_sun) and n_Fe_sun is given. Wait, but I don't have the exact solar abundance of Si. Hmm.

Wait, the question gives the solar photospheric composition as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Si/Fe] by knowing the solar abundance of Si.

Wait, I don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun). If I can compute that, then I can use it.

Alternatively, let's think about the solar photosphere. Let me denote the solar abundance ratios as:

n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, the solar [Mg/Si] is given by [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun).

From Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Mg/Si] value.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/H] = log(n_Mg/n_H) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) )=0 → So n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun = same as the Sun's, which is 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → so [Mg/H]_sun is log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) = (7-12) = -5. So [Mg/H]_sun is -5, but in the Sun, [Mg/H]_sun is zero. Wait no, no. Wait, the [X/H] is defined as log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun. But in the Sun, [X/H]_sun is zero for any element. So, in the Sun, [Mg/H]_sun=0 → which is why 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → because that gives log(nMg/nH) = -5, so [Mg/H] = log(1e-5) - log(1e-5) =0.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the Sun, for any element X:

[X/H]_sun = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun) )

But since n_X_sun /n_H_sun = n_X/n_H in the Sun, then [X/H]_sun is zero. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, meaning its Fe/H is same as Sun. Similarly Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Sun's values. Let me denote for the Sun:

n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.

But what's n_Si_sun/n_H_sun?

Hmm. The question gives [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2, so perhaps I need to relate these.

Let me think about Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

Which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) =0.3.

So,

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) =0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun. Is there a way to find this?

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

Wait, but I don't have that value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find it using other data. Let me think about Star_1. We know [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1 /n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H1.

Also, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 → which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But I don't know n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun. So perhaps I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the given [Mg/Si]_2 for Star_2 and combine the information.

Wait, perhaps I can find the [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data. Hmmm.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) = ?

Because in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0. So that doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait another approach: For Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun) → but wait, not exactly, because the molecular weight changes. Alternatively, because [Fe/H] is given as 0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So for Star_1:

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

But I don't know the relationship between n_H1 and n_H2. Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So perhaps I can express n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of their respective n_H, and then take the ratio.

So let's proceed.

First, let's find n_Si1.

From Star_1's [Si/Fe] =0.3.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - [Si/Fe]_sun =0.3.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

So:

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Si/Fe]_sun.

But I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can express this in terms of the Sun's values.

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun}.

But n_Fe1 is known in terms of n_H1, since [Fe/H]_1=0.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun * n_H1) * 10^{0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun}.

Hmm, but I still have [Si/Fe]_sun unknown. I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find [Si/Fe]_sun using other data.

Wait, maybe from the Sun's composition, I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun. Let me see.

Wait, the Sun's n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun is 1e-4.5. I don't have the Sun's n_Si_sun, but perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun as log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

But I don't have n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the solar [Mg/Si] which would allow me to find [Si/Fe]_sun if I know [Mg/Fe]_sun.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach.

Let me consider both stars and try to find the ratio of silicon in each.

Wait, perhaps for Star_2, the [Mg/Si] is 0.3, and [Mg/H]=0.

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But since [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 /n_H_sun).

Wait, because [Mg/H]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_H2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) ) =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So,

log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2 → substitute:

log( [ (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H2 ) / n_Si2 ) =0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si2 in terms of n_H2.

Alternatively, rearrange the [Mg/Si]_2 equation.

n_Mg2 /n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ).

Wait, n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun is the solar [Mg/Si] value, which is [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0 → so [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, so n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun =10^0=1.

Wait, wait, no. Because [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0 → so [Mg/Si]_sun=0, which implies n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun=10^0=1.

So n_Mg_sun = n_Si_sun.

Therefore, for Star_2:

n_Mg2/n_Si2 =10^{0.3} * 1 → n_Mg2 =10^{0.3} * n_Si2.

But from [Mg/H]_2=0, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2.

So,

(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2 = 10^{0.3} * n_Si2.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2 / (10^{0.3} )

But wait,

n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun is given as 1e-5 (since 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → 1e-5).

So,

n_Si2 = (1e-5) * (n_H2) / (10^{0.3} )

So,

n_Si2 = (1e-5) / (10^{0.3}) * n_H2.

Similarly, let's find n_Si1.

In Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun)}.

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

In the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) =0 → no, that's zero. Wait no, no. Because [X/Y]_sun is defined as log(n_X/n_Y)_sun - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun ) → but wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no. The definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun).

So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun = log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) )=0.

So [Si/Fe]_sun=0 → log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) =0 → n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun=1.

So,

n_Si_sun =n_Fe_sun.

Therefore, for Star_1:

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + 0 → 0.3.

So,

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

n_Fe_sun is known? Let me see.

Yes, from the Sun's data: n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So,

n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H1.

Thus,

n_Si1 = (1e-4.5 *n_H1) *10^{0.3}.

10^{0.3} is approximately 2, since 10^0.3≈1.995≈2.

So,

n_Si1 = 1e-4.5 * 2 *n_H1 = 2e-4.5 *n_H1.

Wait, 1e-4.5 is 3.16e-5, so 2e-4.5 is about 6.32e-5.

But I don't know the exact value; perhaps I can keep it as 10^{0.3}.

So, n_Si1 = 1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} *n_H1.

Now, for Star_2, we have n_Si2 = (1e-5) *n_H2 / 10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is:

[ (1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} *n_H1 ) ] / [ (1e-5 *n_H2 ) /10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

= (1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} ) / (1e-5 /10^{0.3}) ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= [ (1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} ) *10^{0.3} / 1e-5 ) ] * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= [1e-4.5 *10^{0.6} / 1e-5 ] * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Compute 1e-4.5 /1e-5 = 1e( -4.5 +5 ) = 1e0.5 = sqrt(10) ≈3.162.

So,

= 3.162 * 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Wait, 10^{0.6} is about 3.98, so 3.162 *3.98 ≈12.54.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 12.54 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, but I think I can find n_H1 and n_H2. Because the mass of the star affects the surface gravity, right? But wait, the problem is about elemental abundances, not about line broadening. Oh, wait, perhaps the question assumes that the hydrogen number densities are the same? Or perhaps I can relate the total number densities? Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the total mass of the star doesn't directly affect the elemental abundances unless considering pressure or gravity, but the problem says to assume LTE, so I think it's about the number densities. But I'm not sure about the relation between n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, but perhaps for the ratio of silicon, the H ratio will cancel out if the stars have the same effective temperature and gravity? Or perhaps not. I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the number density of hydrogen in a star's photosphere is determined by the star's surface gravity and temperature. If the stars have different masses, their surface gravities would be different. But wait, the problem doesn't provide any information about their surface gravities or temperatures. So perhaps the question assumes that the H number densities are the same, or that the ratio (n_H1/n_H2) is 1. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) is only determined by the [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] values, and the [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H] values, without considering n_H1 and n_H2. But I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun. [Si/Fe]=0.3 → Si is 10^0.3 times higher than Fe. So in Star_1, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^0.3. But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1. And in the Sun, n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun is 1e-4.5. So n_Si1 = (1e-4.5) * n_H1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → Mg is same as Sun. [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg is 10^0.3 times Si. So n_Mg2 = n_Si2 *10^0.3.

But n_Mg2 is also (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2 =1e-5 *n_H2.

So,

1e-5 *n_H2 = n_Si2 *10^0.3 → n_Si2 = (1e-5 *n_H2 ) / 10^0.3.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is:

(1e-4.5 *n_H1 *10^0.3) / (1e-5 *n_H2 /10^0.3 )

= 1e-4.5 /1e-5 * 10^0.3 *10^0.3 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 10^0.5 * 10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Wait, 0.3 +0.3=0.6. So,

= 10^{0.5 +0.6} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

=10^{1.1} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

10^1.1 is about 12.589.

So, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 12.589 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Hmm, but I don't have the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same surface gravity. Because if two stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, their surface gravity (g) is determined by their mass and radius. But the problem doesn't give any info about the radius or surface gravity.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that both stars have the same temperature and pressure, so their number densities are the same. But that doesn't make sense because their masses are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2 is the same as the ratio of the total number of particles, but I don't see how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the number densities of hydrogen are the same for both stars, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the H number density is determined by the star's mass, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think that the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2 is 1. But I'm not confident.

Wait, let's think about the ratio of the total number of particles. For a star, the total number density (n_total) is the sum of all element's number densities. But without knowing all the elements, I can't compute that.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the problem expects me to ignore the H ratio, assuming it's the same for both stars. If I do that, then (n_H1/n_H2) =1, and the ratio is 12.589, which is about 12.6, which is option B.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So 12.6 is option B.

But why would n_H1/n_H2 =1? That's a big assumption. Because the stars have different masses, their surface gravities would be different, which would affect the scale heights and hence the number densities.

Wait, surface gravity g is proportional to mass/(radius^2). If the radius isn't given, I can't compute g. But perhaps the problem expects me to ignore this and proceed, thinking that the ratio is only based on the given abundance ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the H number densities are the same because the problem doesn't provide any information about the stars' surface gravity or radii, so I can assume they're the same.

If that's the case, then n_Si1/n_Si2 =12.589, which is approximately 12.6, so option B.

So I think the answer is B.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data and Definitions:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si abundance relative to Fe is 10^{0.3} ≈ 2 times higher than Fe.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg abundance relative to Si is 10^{0.3} ≈ 2 times higher than Si.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^{-4.5}.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^{-5}.
   - [Mg/Si]_sun = 0 → nMg/nSi = 1 in the Sun.

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^{-4.5}.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies nSi1/nFe1 = 10^{0.3} ≈ 2.
- Substituting nFe1 = (10^{-4.5})nH1, we get:
  \[
  nSi1 = 2 \cdot (10^{-4.5})nH1 = 2 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot nH1 \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot nH1.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun = 10^{-5}.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} ≈ 2.
- Substituting nMg2 = (10^{-5})nH2, we get:
  \[
  nSi2 = \frac{(10^{-5})nH2}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot nH2.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{nSi1}{nSi2} = \frac{(6.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot nH1)}{(5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot nH2)} = \frac{6.32}{5} \cdot 10^{1} \cdot \frac{nH1}{nH2}.
\]
- Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{nSi1}{nSi2} \approx 1.264 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{nH1}{nH2} = 12.64 \cdot \frac{nH1}{nH2}.
  \]

#### Assumption:
Since the problem does not provide information about the stars' radii or surface gravities, we assume the hydrogen number densities are the same for both stars (\(nH1/nH2 = 1\)).

### Final Ratio:
\[
\frac{nSi1}{nSi2} \approx 12.6.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. The data are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=10^-5

The question is: what's the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2? So, (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2)?

The options are A to D, with numbers like ~3.9, ~12.6, etc. Hmm.

Wait, I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star because the ratio of silicon would depend on their [Si/H] values. Then I can compare them to get the ratio.

Let me think about the given data. For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as solar. So [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe,nH)_sun. Wait, no, I think [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, actually, the notation [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) relative to the Sun. So for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) =0 → So their ratio is the same as solar.

Which means n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = 10^([Fe/H}_1 + log(nFe/nH)_sun )

Wait, no, wait. Because [Fe/H]_1 is defined as log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 0 → So log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) = log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

But in the Sun, n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5), since from the data 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH) is -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 means Fe abundance is same as Sun, so n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) → n_Fe1 = n_H1 * 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → same as Sun, so n_Mg2/n_H2 = 1e-5 (since in Sun, nMg/nH=1e-5).

Wait, but for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → which is log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know the solar [Mg/Si]. Let me think.

Wait, I need to find the [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratio.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, for Star 1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. That is, log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) )=0.3.

Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So,

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

What's the solar ratio n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun? Let's compute.

In the Sun, n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun = (n_Si_sun) / (n_Fe_sun).

But wait, I don't have the solar [Si/Fe] value given. Oh wait, I can compute it.

In the Sun, n_Si = (n_Si_sun) and n_Fe_sun is given. Wait, but I don't have the exact solar abundance of Si. Hmm.

Wait, the question gives the solar photospheric composition as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Si/Fe] by knowing the solar abundance of Si.

Wait, I don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun). If I can compute that, then I can use it.

Alternatively, let's think about the solar photosphere. Let me denote the solar abundance ratios as:

n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, the solar [Mg/Si] is given by [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun).

From Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Mg/Si] value.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/H] = log(n_Mg/n_H) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) )=0 → So n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun = same as the Sun's, which is 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → so [Mg/H]_sun is log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) = (7-12) = -5. So [Mg/H]_sun is -5, but in the Sun, [Mg/H]_sun is zero. Wait no, no. Wait, the [X/H] is defined as log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X/n_H)_sun. But in the Sun, [X/H]_sun is zero for any element. So, in the Sun, [Mg/H]_sun=0 → which is why 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → because that gives log(nMg/nH) = -5, so [Mg/H] = log(1e-5) - log(1e-5) =0.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the Sun, for any element X:

[X/H]_sun = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun) )

But since n_X_sun /n_H_sun = n_X/n_H in the Sun, then [X/H]_sun is zero. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, meaning its Fe/H is same as Sun. Similarly Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Sun's values. Let me denote for the Sun:

n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.

But what's n_Si_sun/n_H_sun?

Hmm. The question gives [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2, so perhaps I need to relate these.

Let me think about Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

Which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) =0.3.

So,

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) =0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun. Is there a way to find this?

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_sun as log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

Wait, but I don't have that value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find it using other data. Let me think about Star_1. We know [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1 /n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H1.

Also, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 → which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But I don't know n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun. So perhaps I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the given [Mg/Si]_2 for Star_2 and combine the information.

Wait, perhaps I can find the [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data. Hmmm.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) = ?

Because in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0. So that doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait another approach: For Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun) → but wait, not exactly, because the molecular weight changes. Alternatively, because [Fe/H] is given as 0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So for Star_1:

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

But I don't know the relationship between n_H1 and n_H2. Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So perhaps I can express n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of their respective n_H, and then take the ratio.

So let's proceed.

First, let's find n_Si1.

From Star_1's [Si/Fe] =0.3.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - [Si/Fe]_sun =0.3.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

So:

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Si/Fe]_sun.

But I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can express this in terms of the Sun's values.

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun}.

But n_Fe1 is known in terms of n_H1, since [Fe/H]_1=0.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun * n_H1) * 10^{0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun}.

Hmm, but I still have [Si/Fe]_sun unknown. I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find [Si/Fe]_sun using other data.

Wait, maybe from the Sun's composition, I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun. Let me see.

Wait, the Sun's n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun is 1e-4.5. I don't have the Sun's n_Si_sun, but perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun as log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

But I don't have n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the solar [Mg/Si] which would allow me to find [Si/Fe]_sun if I know [Mg/Fe]_sun.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach.

Let me consider both stars and try to find the ratio of silicon in each.

Wait, perhaps for Star_2, the [Mg/Si] is 0.3, and [Mg/H]=0.

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But since [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 /n_H_sun).

Wait, because [Mg/H]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_H2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) ) =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So,

log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

But n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2 → substitute:

log( [ (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H2 ) / n_Si2 ) =0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun).

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si2 in terms of n_H2.

Alternatively, rearrange the [Mg/Si]_2 equation.

n_Mg2 /n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ).

Wait, n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun is the solar [Mg/Si] value, which is [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0 → so [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, so n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun =10^0=1.

Wait, wait, no. Because [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0 → so [Mg/Si]_sun=0, which implies n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun=10^0=1.

So n_Mg_sun = n_Si_sun.

Therefore, for Star_2:

n_Mg2/n_Si2 =10^{0.3} * 1 → n_Mg2 =10^{0.3} * n_Si2.

But from [Mg/H]_2=0, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2.

So,

(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H2 = 10^{0.3} * n_Si2.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2 / (10^{0.3} )

But wait,

n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun is given as 1e-5 (since 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → 1e-5).

So,

n_Si2 = (1e-5) * (n_H2) / (10^{0.3} )

So,

n_Si2 = (1e-5) / (10^{0.3}) * n_H2.

Similarly, let's find n_Si1.

In Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun)}.

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun.

In the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) =0 → no, that's zero. Wait no, no. Because [X/Y]_sun is defined as log(n_X/n_Y)_sun - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun ) → but wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no. The definition is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun).

So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun = log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) )=0.

So [Si/Fe]_sun=0 → log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) =0 → n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun=1.

So,

n_Si_sun =n_Fe_sun.

Therefore, for Star_1:

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + 0 → 0.3.

So,

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

n_Fe_sun is known? Let me see.

Yes, from the Sun's data: n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So,

n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H1.

Thus,

n_Si1 = (1e-4.5 *n_H1) *10^{0.3}.

10^{0.3} is approximately 2, since 10^0.3≈1.995≈2.

So,

n_Si1 = 1e-4.5 * 2 *n_H1 = 2e-4.5 *n_H1.

Wait, 1e-4.5 is 3.16e-5, so 2e-4.5 is about 6.32e-5.

But I don't know the exact value; perhaps I can keep it as 10^{0.3}.

So, n_Si1 = 1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} *n_H1.

Now, for Star_2, we have n_Si2 = (1e-5) *n_H2 / 10^{0.3}.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is:

[ (1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} *n_H1 ) ] / [ (1e-5 *n_H2 ) /10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

= (1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} ) / (1e-5 /10^{0.3}) ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= [ (1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} ) *10^{0.3} / 1e-5 ) ] * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= [1e-4.5 *10^{0.6} / 1e-5 ] * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Compute 1e-4.5 /1e-5 = 1e( -4.5 +5 ) = 1e0.5 = sqrt(10) ≈3.162.

So,

= 3.162 * 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Wait, 10^{0.6} is about 3.98, so 3.162 *3.98 ≈12.54.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 12.54 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, but I think I can find n_H1 and n_H2. Because the mass of the star affects the surface gravity, right? But wait, the problem is about elemental abundances, not about line broadening. Oh, wait, perhaps the question assumes that the hydrogen number densities are the same? Or perhaps I can relate the total number densities? Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the total mass of the star doesn't directly affect the elemental abundances unless considering pressure or gravity, but the problem says to assume LTE, so I think it's about the number densities. But I'm not sure about the relation between n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, but perhaps for the ratio of silicon, the H ratio will cancel out if the stars have the same effective temperature and gravity? Or perhaps not. I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the number density of hydrogen in a star's photosphere is determined by the star's surface gravity and temperature. If the stars have different masses, their surface gravities would be different. But wait, the problem doesn't provide any information about their surface gravities or temperatures. So perhaps the question assumes that the H number densities are the same, or that the ratio (n_H1/n_H2) is 1. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) is only determined by the [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] values, and the [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H] values, without considering n_H1 and n_H2. But I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun. [Si/Fe]=0.3 → Si is 10^0.3 times higher than Fe. So in Star_1, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^0.3. But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1. And in the Sun, n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun is 1e-4.5. So n_Si1 = (1e-4.5) * n_H1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → Mg is same as Sun. [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg is 10^0.3 times Si. So n_Mg2 = n_Si2 *10^0.3.

But n_Mg2 is also (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2 =1e-5 *n_H2.

So,

1e-5 *n_H2 = n_Si2 *10^0.3 → n_Si2 = (1e-5 *n_H2 ) / 10^0.3.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is:

(1e-4.5 *n_H1 *10^0.3) / (1e-5 *n_H2 /10^0.3 )

= 1e-4.5 /1e-5 * 10^0.3 *10^0.3 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= 10^0.5 * 10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Wait, 0.3 +0.3=0.6. So,

= 10^{0.5 +0.6} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

=10^{1.1} * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

10^1.1 is about 12.589.

So, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 12.589 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Hmm, but I don't have the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same surface gravity. Because if two stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, their surface gravity (g) is determined by their mass and radius. But the problem doesn't give any info about the radius or surface gravity.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that both stars have the same temperature and pressure, so their number densities are the same. But that doesn't make sense because their masses are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2 is the same as the ratio of the total number of particles, but I don't see how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the number densities of hydrogen are the same for both stars, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the H number density is determined by the star's mass, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think that the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2 is 1. But I'm not confident.

Wait, let's think about the ratio of the total number of particles. For a star, the total number density (n_total) is the sum of all element's number densities. But without knowing all the elements, I can't compute that.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the problem expects me to ignore the H ratio, assuming it's the same for both stars. If I do that, then (n_H1/n_H2) =1, and the ratio is 12.589, which is about 12.6, which is option B.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So 12.6 is option B.

But why would n_H1/n_H2 =1? That's a big assumption. Because the stars have different masses, their surface gravities would be different, which would affect the scale heights and hence the number densities.

Wait, surface gravity g is proportional to mass/(radius^2). If the radius isn't given, I can't compute g. But perhaps the problem expects me to ignore this and proceed, thinking that the ratio is only based on the given abundance ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the H number densities are the same because the problem doesn't provide any information about the stars' surface gravity or radii, so I can assume they're the same.

If that's the case, then n_Si1/n_Si2 =12.589, which is approximately 12.6, so option B.

So I think the answer is B.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data and Definitions:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si abundance relative to Fe is 10^{0.3} ≈ 2 times higher than Fe.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg abundance relative to Si is 10^{0.3} ≈ 2 times higher than Si.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^{-4.5}.
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^{-5}.
   - [Mg/Si]_sun = 0 → nMg/nSi = 1 in the Sun.

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^{-4.5}.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies nSi1/nFe1 = 10^{0.3} ≈ 2.
- Substituting nFe1 = (10^{-4.5})nH1, we get:
  \[
  nSi1 = 2 \cdot (10^{-4.5})nH1 = 2 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot nH1 \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot nH1.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun = 10^{-5}.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} ≈ 2.
- Substituting nMg2 = (10^{-5})nH2, we get:
  \[
  nSi2 = \frac{(10^{-5})nH2}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot nH2.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{nSi1}{nSi2} = \frac{(6.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot nH1)}{(5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot nH2)} = \frac{6.32}{5} \cdot 10^{1} \cdot \frac{nH1}{nH2}.
\]
- Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{nSi1}{nSi2} \approx 1.264 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{nH1}{nH2} = 12.64 \cdot \frac{nH1}{nH2}.
  \]

#### Assumption:
Since the problem does not provide information about the stars' radii or surface gravities, we assume the hydrogen number densities are the same for both stars (\(nH1/nH2 = 1\)).

### Final Ratio:
\[
\frac{nSi1}{nSi2} \approx 12.6.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
