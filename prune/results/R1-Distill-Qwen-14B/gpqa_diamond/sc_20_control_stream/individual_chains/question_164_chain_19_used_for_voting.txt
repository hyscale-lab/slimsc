Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary systems are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question is asking me by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh, the options are A to D, which are all different decimal factors.

Let me read the question again. Both systems have eclipses with certain periods. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. Wait, so their orbital periods are 2 and 1 years respectively. Also, the periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Oh, right, in binary stars, the eclipse period is the same as the orbital period because the stars are eclipsing each other as they orbit.

Then there are spectroscopic observations, which give the radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocities of the two stars are inversely proportional to their masses. Like, if one star is more massive, it moves slower because it's closer to the center of mass. So the less massive star has a higher RV amplitude.

The mass function relates the masses of the stars to the observed velocities. I think the formula involves the velocity amplitudes and the period. Oh right, the mass function for each star in the binary system is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1 * P )/( 2π G ), but maybe I'm mixing up some terms here. Wait, another approach: the ratio of the masses can be found using the velocity amplitudes.

Right, in a binary system, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes. So M1/M2 = K2/K1, where K is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity. So for system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So M1/M2 would be 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2 in system_1. But wait, that can't be right because the total mass would be M1 + M2.

Wait, no, in the binary system, the more massive star has the smaller velocity. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the mass ratio q is M2/M1 = (K1)/(K2). Because if M2 is more massive, it has a smaller K. So in system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M2 is twice as massive as M1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2M1 = 3M1. So M1 = (M_total_1)/3.

But wait, the problem is asking about the mass of each system, which is the sum of the two stars. So for each system, I need to find the total mass and compare them.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect this? Because Kepler's third law relates the period to the masses. The formula is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ (M1 + M2) a³, where a is the semi-major axis. But I don't have the semi-major axis directly.

Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass and the period. The formula I think is K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not sure about the exact form. Wait, maybe another approach.

The mass function for each star is f(M) = (M2³ sin³ i) / ( (M1 + M2)² ) ) = (K1 P)/(2π G) ) * (1/(1 + q)² ), where q is the mass ratio M2/M1. But if the inclination angle is the same for both systems, which we can assume since we're comparing the two, then sin i would be the same, maybe 1 for both (edge-on, which is the case for eclipsing binaries). So I can ignore the sin i terms as they are the same for both systems.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the total masses of the two systems can be found by comparing their velocity amplitudes and periods.

Wait, another formula: In a binary system, the mass ratio is given by (M2/M1) = (K1/K2). Because the more massive star moves slower. So in system_1, M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So in system_1, M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

For system_2, the velocity amplitudes are 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10. So M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2 = 1.5. So M2=1.5 M1. The total mass is then M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, no, wait: in system_2, which star is which? Let me think again. System_2's velocities are 15 and 10. So K1 is 15, K2 is10. So the ratio M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 15/10=1.5. So M2 is 1.5 times M1 in system_2. So total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but M1 here refers to each system's own M1. Hmm, perhaps I should use different variables for each system. Let me clarify.

Let's denote for system_1:

M1a and M2a are the masses of the two stars.

Similarly, system_2: M1b and M2b.

So for system_1: M2a/M1a = K1a / K2a = 10/5 = 2. So M2a = 2 M1a. Total mass = M1a + M2a = 3 M1a.

For system_2: M2b/M1b = K1b / K2b = 15/10 = 1.5. So M2b = 1.5 M1b. Total mass = M1b + M2b = 2.5 M1b.

But how does the period come into play? Because the period relates to the total mass of the system. The larger the mass, the longer the period? Wait, no, it's the other way around. Wait, Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³/(M1 + M2). So for a given separation a, a more massive system will have a shorter orbital period. But in our case, the periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. So system_1 has a longer period than system_2. But I'm not sure how that affects the masses.

Wait, but the velocity amplitudes are related to the masses and the period. Let me think about another approach. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * P^(1/3) ) ) 

Assuming that the inclination i is the same for both systems (e.g., edge-on, which is the case for eclipsing binaries), then sin i is 1. So for system_1:

K1a = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2a) / ( ( (M1a + M2a )^(2/3) ) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly for K2a:

K2a = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1a) / ( ( (M1a + M2a )^(2/3) ) * P1^(1/3) )

So, K1a / K2a = M2a / M1a = 2, as before.

But perhaps I can relate the velocities and the periods to find the total masses.

Wait, let me take the ratio of the two velocities in a system. For system_1, K1a = 10, K2a=5. So K1a=2*K2a.

Which gives M2a = 2 M1a.

Similarly, for system_2, K1b=15, K2b=10, so K1b=1.5*K2b. So M2b = 1.5 M1b.

But to find the total mass of each system, I need to express M1a and M1b in terms that can be compared.

Wait, perhaps using the same formula for each system and then taking the ratio.

Let me write the formula for each K.

For system_1:

K1a = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * M2a sin i / ( (M1a + M2a )^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2a = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * M1a sin i / ( (M1a + M2a )^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Dividing these two equations, K1a / K2a = M2a / M1a = 2.

Which we already know.

Now, for system_2:

K1b = (2π G)^(1/3) * M2b sin i / ( (M1b + M2b )^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

K2b = same formula but with M1b.

So K1b / K2b = M2b / M1b = 1.5.

So, the question is, how do the total masses of the two systems compare?

We can write the total mass as M_total_1 = M1a + M2a = M1a + 2 M1a = 3 M1a.

M_total_2 = M1b + M2b = M1b + 1.5 M1b = 2.5 M1b.

So, to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (3 M1a) / (2.5 M1b) ).

But we need another relation between M1a and M1b. Maybe via the period and the velocity amplitudes.

Hmm. Let's see, can we find the ratio of the system masses using the velocities and the periods?

Let me consider the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude again.

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since sin i is the same for both systems, we can ignore it when taking the ratio.

So, for system_1, let's write K1a in terms of M_total_1 and P1.

K1a = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2a) / ( (M_total_1)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, M2a = 2 M1a, and M_total_1 = 3 M1a.

So, substituting, K1a = (2π G)^(1/3) * (2 M1a) / ( (3 M1a)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) )

Wait, because P1 is 2 years.

Wait, let me compute this.

K1a = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (2 M1a) ) / [ (3 M1a )^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify the denominator:

(3 M1a )^(2/3 ) = 3^(2/3) * (M1a )^(2/3 )

(2)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3 )

So denominator is 3^(2/3) * M1a^(2/3) * 2^(1/3 )

So putting it all together:

K1a = [ (2π G)^(1/3) * 2 M1a ] / [ 3^(2/3) M1a^(2/3) 2^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The 2 M1a in numerator is 2* M1a.

Denominator has 3^(2/3) * M1a^(2/3) * 2^(1/3).

So, 2 / 2^(1/3) = 2^(1 - 1/3) = 2^(2/3).

M1a / M1a^(2/3) = M1a^(1 - 2/3) = M1a^(1/3).

So now,

K1a = (2π G)^(1/3) * 2^(2/3) * M1a^(1/3) / (3^(2/3) )

= (2π G)^(1/3) * [ (2^2)^(1/3) ) ] * M1a^(1/3) / (3^(2/3) )

= (2π G)^(1/3) * (4)^(1/3) * M1a^(1/3) / (3^(2/3) )

Alternatively, 2^(2/3) is same as 4^(1/3).

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

K1a = [ (2π G) * (4) / (3^2) ) ]^(1/3) * M1a^(1/3)

Because 3^(2/3) is (3^2)^(1/3).

Wait, (3^2) is 9, so 3^(2/3) = 9^(1/3).

So,

K1a = [ (2π G) * (4) / 9 ) ]^(1/3) * (M1a)^(1/3 )

Similarly, the same approach for system_2's K1b.

For system_2:

K1b = (2π G)^(1/3) * M2b / ( (M_total_2)^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

We know M2b=1.5 M1b, and M_total_2 = 2.5 M1b.

So,

K1b = (2π G)^(1/3) * (1.5 M1b) / [ (2.5 M1b )^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) ) ]

Because P2 is 1 year.

So,

Denominator: (2.5 M1b )^(2/3) = (2.5)^(2/3) * M1b^(2/3 )

So,

K1b = (2π G)^(1/3) * 1.5 M1b / [ (2.5)^(2/3) M1b^(2/3 ) * 1 ]

= (2π G)^(1/3) * 1.5 / (2.5)^(2/3) ) * M1b^(1/3 )

Because M1b / M1b^(2/3) = M1b^(1/3).

So, K1b is proportional to [ (2π G) * (1.5) / (2.5)^(2) ) ]^(1/3) ) * M1b^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, let me re-express the constants.

Hmm, perhaps I can take the ratio of K1a and K1b, and see how M1a and M1b relate.

Let me write:

K1a / K1b = [ ( [ (2π G) * (4) / 9 ] / [ (2π G) * (1.5) / (2.5)^2 ) ] )^(1/3) ] * [ M1a^(1/3) / M1b^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to take the ratio of K1a over K1b:

K1a / K1b = [ ( (2π G) * 4 / 9 ) / ( (2π G) * 1.5 / (2.5)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M1a / M1b )^(1/3 )

Because the other terms (like (2π G)^(1/3) ) would cancel out when taking the ratio.

So,

K1a/K1b = [ (4/9) / ( (1.5) / (6.25) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M1a / M1b )^(1/3 )

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator inside the brackets.

Numerator inside: 4/9.

Denominator inside: 1.5 / (2.5)^2 = 1.5 /6.25 = 0.24.

So,

(4/9 ) / (0.24 ) = (4/9 ) * (1/0.24 ) = (4/9 ) * (4.16666...) ) ≈ 4 * 4.16667 /9 ≈ 16.6667/9 ≈ 1.85185.

So,

K1a/K1b ≈ (1.85185 )^(1/3) * ( M1a/M1b )^(1/3 )

But K1a is given as 10 km/s, K1b is 15 km/s. So K1a/K1b = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So,

0.6667 ≈ (1.85185 )^(1/3) * ( M1a/M1b )^(1/3 )

Compute (1.85185 )^(1/3). Cube root of 1.85185. Let's see, 1.2^3=1.728, 1.25^3=1.953125. So 1.85 is between 1.2^3 and 1.25^3. Let me compute cube of 1.24: 1.24^3 = approx 1.24*1.24=1.5376, then *1.24: 1.5376*1.24 ≈ 1.906. So 1.24^3 ≈1.906. Our number is 1.85185, which is a bit less than that. So approximately, 1.235^3. Let me compute 1.235^3.

1.235 *1.235 = approx 1.525. Then 1.525 *1.235. Let me compute:

1.5 *1.235 = 1.8525.

0.025 *1.235=0.030875.

So total is 1.8525 +0.030875=1.883375. Hmm, that's higher than 1.85185. Let me try 1.23.

1.23^3: 1.23 *1.23=1.5129. Then 1.5129 *1.23. Let's compute:

1.5*1.23=1.845, 0.0129*1.23≈0.0158. So sum is about 1.8608. That's higher than 1.85185. Let's try 1.225.

1.225^3: 1.225 *1.225=1.5006. Then 1.5006 *1.225.

1.5*1.225=1.8375, 0.0006*1.225=0.000735. Sum is 1.838235. Hmm, which is lower than 1.85185.

Wait, so cube of 1.225 is ~1.838, cube of 1.23 is ~1.8608. We need 1.85185, which is between 1.225 and 1.23.

Let me find a better approximation. Let's compute at 1.228.

1.228^3: 1.228 *1.228 = let's compute:

1.2 *1.2 =1.44; 1.2 *0.028=0.0336; 0.028*1.2=0.0336; 0.028^2=0.000784. So (1.2+0.028)^2 = 1.44 + 0.0336+0.0336 +0.000784 = 1.44 +0.0672 +0.000784=1.507984.

Then multiply by 1.228: 1.507984 *1.228.

1.5 *1.228 =1.842.

0.007984 *1.228 ≈0.009796.

So total is approximately 1.842 +0.0098=1.8518. Oh! Exactly our number. So the cube root of 1.85185 is approximately 1.228.

So,

K1a/K1b ≈ 1.228 * ( M1a / M1b )^(1/3 )

But K1a/K1b is 2/3 ≈0.6667.

So,

0.6667 ≈ 1.228 * ( M1a / M1b )^(1/3 )

Divide both sides by 1.228:

0.6667 / 1.228 ≈ ( M1a / M1b )^(1/3 )

Calculate 0.6667 / 1.228: 0.6667 is approximately 2/3. 2/3 ≈0.6667. 0.6667/1.228 ≈ 0.5427.

So,

0.5427 ≈ ( M1a / M1b )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

(0.5427)^3 ≈ M1a / M1b

Compute 0.5427^3: 0.5427 *0.5427 = ~0.2945. Then 0.2945 *0.5427 ≈0.1603.

So, M1a / M1b ≈0.1603.

Which is approximately 0.16.

So, M1a is about 0.16 times M1b.

Wait, but M1a is the mass of the first star in system_1, and M1b is the first star in system_2. But how does that relate to the total masses?

Earlier, we had:

M_total_1 =3 M1a.

M_total_2=2.5 M1b.

We need to find (M_total_1)/(M_total_2) = (3 M1a )/(2.5 M1b ) = (3/2.5) * (M1a/M1b ) = 1.2 * 0.1603 ≈ 0.1924.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.1924 is less than 1, which would mean system_1 is less massive than system_2. But the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Which would require the factor to be greater than 1. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let's recap. The calculation led me to M1a / M1b ≈ 0.16. So M1a is about 0.16 times M1b. So M1a is smaller. So M_total_1 is 3 * M1a and M_total_2 is 2.5 * M1b.

So M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (3 M1a ) / (2.5 M1b ) ) = (3/2.5) * (M1a/M1b ) ) = 1.2 * 0.16≈0.192.

Wait, that would imply system_1 is about 0.19 times as massive as system_2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. If it's 0.19 times, system_1 is less massive, which would make the factor about 5.26 times less. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the ratio somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass function ratio. Let me recheck.

Wait, K is proportional to (M2 sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So for system_1, K1a = (M2a) / ( (M_total_1)^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, system_2: K1b = (M2b) / ( (M_total_2)^(2/3) P2^(1/3) )

So, the ratio K1a/K1b = [ M2a / M2b ] * [ (M_total_2 / M_total_1 )^(2/3) ] * [ P2 / P1 ]^(1/3 )

Wait, because when you take the ratio, it's (M2a / M_total_1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ) / (M2b / M_total_2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) )

Which is [ M2a / M2b ] * [ (M_total_2 / M_total_1 )^(2/3) ] * [ P2 / P1 ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

K1a/K1b = (M2a/M2b) * ( (M_total_2/M_total_1 )^(2/3) ) * ( P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

But earlier, I have M2a = 2 M1a, and M_total_1 =3 M1a. So M2a = (2/3) M_total_1.

Similarly, M2b=1.5 M1b, and M_total_2=2.5 M1b. So M2b= (1.5/2.5) M_total_2 = (3/5) M_total_2.

So,

M2a / M2b = [ (2/3) M_total_1 ] / [ (3/5) M_total_2 ] = (2/3 *5/3 ) * ( M_total_1 / M_total_2 ) = (10/9) * ( M_total_1 / M_total_2 )

Plugging into the ratio equation:

K1a/K1b = (10/9 ( M_total_1 / M_total_2 )) * ( ( M_total_2 / M_total_1 )^(2/3) ) * ( 1/2 )^(1/3 )

Because P2 is 1, P1 is 2, so P2/P1 = 1/2.

Let me compute each part.

Let me denote x = M_total_1 / M_total_2. So x is the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Then, the equation becomes:

K1a/K1b = ( (10/9) x ) * ( (1/x ) )^(2/3) ) * (1/2)^(1/3 )

Simplify:

= (10/9 x ) * ( x^(-2/3) ) * (1/2^(1/3) )

= (10/(9 * 2^(1/3) )) ) * x^(1 - 2/3 )

= (10/(9 * 2^(1/3) )) ) * x^(1/3 )

We know K1a/K1b = 10/15 = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = (10/(9 * 2^(1/3) )) ) * x^(1/3 )

Multiply both sides by 9 * 2^(1/3) /10:

(2/3) * (9 * 2^(1/3) ) /10 = x^(1/3 )

Compute the left side:

(2/3) * (9 * 2^(1/3) ) /10 = (2 * 9 * 2^(1/3) ) / (3 *10 ) ) = (18 * 2^(1/3) ) / 30 = (3 * 2^(1/3) ) /5.

So,

x^(1/3) = (3 * 2^(1/3) ) /5.

Cube both sides:

x = [ (3 * 2^(1/3) ) /5 ]^3 = (27 * (2^(1) )) ) / (125 ) = (54) / 125 = 0.432.

So x is approximately 0.432.

x is M_total_1 / M_total_2. So system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Which means system_2 is more massive by a factor of about 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315. But the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Since 0.432 is less than 1, it means system_1 is less massive, not more. So I must have done something wrong because the question states, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?".

Wait, perhaps I messed up the ratio. Let me recheck the earlier steps.

In the equation:

x^(1/3) = (3 * 2^(1/3) ) /5.

Wait, let's compute that again.

(3 * 2^(1/3) ) /5 ≈ (3 * 1.26 ) /5 ≈ (3.78 ) /5 ≈ 0.756.

So x^(1/3) ≈0.756.

So x = (0.756)^3 ≈0.756 *0.756 = ~0.5715; 0.5715 *0.756 ≈0.432.

So x is 0.432, as before.

So system_1 is about 0.432 times the mass of system_2. Which means system_2 is about 2.31 times more massive than system_1.

But the question is asking "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If system_1 is less massive, the factor would be less than 1. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, which would mean it's about 0.43 times the mass. So the factor is approximately 0.43. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6.

Wait, the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If the factor is less than 1, it's less massive. So perhaps the answer is 0.43 times, which is close to option A (0.4) or option B (0.6). But 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than 0.6.

Wait, but let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the mass ratio? Let's see.

Wait, another approach: the mass function for each system. The mass function is given by f(M) = (M2³ sin³ i) / ( (M1 + M2 )² ) ) = (K1 P ) / (2π G ), but with the period in seconds and velocities in m/s.

But perhaps I can find the mass function for each system and then compare. Wait, but without knowing the actual distance or other details, it's tricky. Alternatively, since both systems are eclipsing binaries, perhaps the inclination is the same (i=90 degrees), so sin i=1.

Wait, but I don't have the actual velocity amplitudes in m/s, just km/s. But perhaps we can relate the mass functions.

Wait, no, perhaps I can write the mass function for each system and find the ratio.

For system_1, the mass function f1 = (M2a³) / ( (M_total_1 )² ) ) = (K1a P1 )/(2π G )

Similarly, for system_2, f2 = (M2b³ ) / ( (M_total_2 )² ) ) = (K1b P2 )/(2π G )

Taking the ratio f1/f2 = [ (M2a³ M_total_2²) / (M2b³ M_total_1²) ) ] * (P1 / P2 )

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total masses.

Wait, but given the time I've spent and the possible options, perhaps the correct answer is approximately 0.4 times, which is option A.

But wait, let's think of another approach. In a binary system, the mass function can be written as f(M) = (M2³ sin³ i) / ( (M1 + M2 )² ), but when you have two stars orbiting each other, the mass ratio is q = M2/M1.

We found earlier that q1 = 2 (M2a/M1a =2 ), q2=1.5 (M2b/M1b=1.5).

The mass function can be expressed in terms of q. For system_1, f1 = (M2a³ ) / ( (M_total_1 )^2 ) ) = ( ( q1 M1a )³ ) / ( ( M1a (1 + q1) )^2 )) )

= ( q1^3 M1a^3 ) / ( M1a^2 (1+q1)^2 ) )

= ( q1^3 M1a ) / ( (1 + q1 )^2 )

Similarly, for system_2, f2 = ( q2^3 M1b ) / ( (1 + q2 )^2 )

The mass function is also equal to (K1 P )/(2π G ), but since we can't find the actual masses without knowing the distance, perhaps we can find the ratio of the mass functions.

f1/f2 = [ q1^3 (1 + q2 )^2 M1a (1 + q1 )^{-2} ) ] / [ q2^3 (1 + q1 )^2 M1b (1 + q2 )^{-2} ) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me compute f1 = (K1a P1 )/(2π G ), f2=(K1b P2 )/(2π G )

So, f1/f2 = (K1a P1 )/( K1b P2 )

Plugging in the values,

K1a=10, P1=2 years.

K1b=15, P2=1 year.

So,

f1/f2 = (10 * 2 ) / (15 *1 ) ) =20/15=4/3≈1.333.

So, f1= 1.333 f2.

But f1 = ( (q1^3 M1a ) ) / ( (1 + q1 )^2 )

And f2 = ( ( q2^3 M1b ) ) / ( (1 + q2 )^2 )

Wait, but I'm not sure if this leads me anywhere without knowing the actual masses.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that since the period is longer for system_1, that suggests that the system is more massive, because for a longer period, the separation is larger, requiring a larger mass to keep the same orbital speed. But earlier calculations suggested system_1 is less massive, which conflicts with that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio wrong earlier. Let me re-express the ratio:

We have x = M_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.432 as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. So the factor is 0.43. So the answer would be option A (~0.4), but the options don't have 0.43, but option A is ~0.4. So I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Observations**:
   - System_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \) and velocity amplitudes \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_{2a} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - System_2 has an orbital period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \) and velocity amplitudes \( K_{1b} = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - The mass ratio \( q = M_2 / M_1 \) is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes: \( q = K_1 / K_2 \).

2. **Mass Ratios**:
   - For system_1: \( q_1 = M_{2a} / M_{1a} = K_{1a} / K_{2a} = 10 / 5 = 2 \). Thus, \( M_{2a} = 2 M_{1a} \), and the total mass is \( M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1a} + M_{2a} = 3 M_{1a} \).
   - For system_2: \( q_2 = M_{2b} / M_{1b} = K_{1b} / K_{2b} = 15 / 10 = 1.5 \). Thus, \( M_{2b} = 1.5 M_{1b} \), and the total mass is \( M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{1b} + M_{2b} = 2.5 M_{1b} \).

3. **Relative Masses**:
   - The ratio of the total masses is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3 M_{1a}}{2.5 M_{1b}} = \frac{3}{2.5} \cdot \frac{M_{1a}}{M_{1b}}.
     \]
   - Using the velocity-amplitude relationship and the periods, the ratio \( M_{1a} / M_{1b} \) is determined to be approximately \( 0.16 \). Substituting this:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3}{2.5} \cdot 0.16 = 0.432.
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - System_1 is approximately \( 0.432 \) times as massive as system_2. This is closest to the option \( 0.4 \).
