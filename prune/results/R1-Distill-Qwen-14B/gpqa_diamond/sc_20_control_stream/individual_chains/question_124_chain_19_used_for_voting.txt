Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters.

The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? The options are A) 54, B) 68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, I need to figure this out. So, I'm thinking about how the particles move and decay. The particles are moving at a certain speed, which is ultra-relativistic, so their gamma factor (Lorentz factor) is significant. Gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since they're ultra-relativistic, v is close to c, so gamma is large.

The detector is a sphere with radius 30 meters. So the particles are produced at the center, and they have to travel outward. But they decay, so not all make it to the walls. The fraction that makes it depends on their lifetime and how far they can travel before decaying.

Wait, I remember something about the proper lifetime and the dilated lifetime. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So the travel distance is velocity * lifetime. So in the lab frame, the distance a particle travels before decaying is v * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

If the particle's speed is v ≈ c, then distance D = c * gamma * tau.

Now, in the initial scenario, gamma is 20. So the distance would be D = c * 20 * tau. And one third of the particles reach the inner walls, which are at 30 meters. So if D is greater than or equal to 30 meters, some of them will make it. But in this case, maybe the decay length is such that only 1/3 reach the wall. Wait, or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall depends on the ratio of the decay length to the detector radius. The decay length is c * gamma * tau. So if the decay length L is much larger than the detector radius R, then most particles decay after passing through the detector, so all of them would have decayed, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if L is less than R, then the particles have a higher chance of decaying within the detector.

Wait, no, the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So the probability that a particle decays into the detector (radius R) is roughly the ratio of R to the decay length, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability that a particle doesn't decay (i.e., survives) while traveling to the detector wall is e^(-R/L), where L is the decay length. Because the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-x/L), where x is the distance traveled. So P_survive = e^(-x/L).

In the initial case, one third reach the wall. So P_survive is 1/3. So 1/3 = e^(-R/(gamma c tau)), because R is 30 meters, and L = c gamma tau. So L = c gamma tau.

Wait, let's write this down. Let me denote:

The proper lifetime is tau. The average lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau.

The average distance a particle travels before decaying is L = c * gamma tau.

So, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it's traveled a distance R is P = e^(-R/(L)) = e^(-R/(c gamma tau)).

Wait no, wait. The decay length is L = c gamma tau. So R is 30 meters.

So in the initial situation, with gamma = 20, the probability that a particle reaches the detector wall is 1/3. That would mean P = 1/3 = e^(-R/(L)) = e^(-30/(c gamma tau)).

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again.

The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance x is P = e^(-x / L), where L is the decay length. So when x is equal to the detector radius R, P is e^(-R/L) = e^(-R/(c gamma tau)).

In the initial scenario, this probability is 1/3. So,

1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 tau)).

We can solve for c * tau. Let me compute that.

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 tau)

So,

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau)

Multiply both sides by (20 c tau):

ln(1/3) * (20 c tau) = -30.

But ln(1/3) is approximately -1.0986.

So,

(-1.0986) * (20 c tau) = -30.

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 * 20 c tau = 30.

So,

20 c tau = 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.3 meters.

So,

c tau ≈ 27.3 / 20 ≈ 1.365 meters.

Hmm, but wait, that doesn't make much sense, because c is about 3e8 m/s, so tau would be about 1.365e-8 seconds? That seems really small, but okay, perhaps it's correct since the particles are fast and decay quickly.

Now, the question is, what gamma is needed so that the probability P is 2/3 instead of 1/3.

So, set P = 2/3.

2/3 = e^(-30/(c gamma tau)).

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(c gamma tau).

Compute ln(2/3): approximately -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(c gamma tau).

Multiply both sides by (c gamma tau):

-0.4055 * c gamma tau = -30.

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 * c gamma tau = 30.

Now, substitute the value of c tau that we found earlier, which was about 1.365 meters.

So,

0.4055 * gamma * (1.365) = 30.

Compute 0.4055 * 1.365 ≈ 0.4055 * 1.365 ≈ let's calculate:

1.365 * 0.4 = 0.546.

1.365 * 0.0055 = ~0.0075.

So total approx 0.5535.

So,

0.5535 * gamma ≈ 30.

So,

gamma ≈ 30 / 0.5535 ≈ 54.

Wait, that's approximately 54. Let me compute more accurately.

0.4055 * 1.365 = 0.4055 * 1.365.

Let me compute 0.4 * 1.365 = 0.546.

0.0055 * 1.365 = 0.0075075.

Sum is 0.546 + 0.0075075 ≈ 0.5535075.

So,

gamma = 30 / 0.5535075 ≈ approximately 54.17.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We started by noting that the probability to survive is P = e^(-R/(L)), where L is decay length. For the initial case, gamma was 20, and P = 1/3.

So, 1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 tau)).

Then, we solved for c tau and found c tau ≈ 1.365 m.

Then, for the new gamma, we set P = 2/3, and again expressed in terms of gamma. Substituted c tau, solved for gamma and got around 54.

That makes sense. So the answer should be option A) 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' decay probability and their travel distance. The probability that a particle survives decay and reaches the detector wall is given by:

\[
P = e^{-\frac{R}{L}}
\]

where \( R \) is the detector radius (30 meters), and \( L \) is the decay length, defined as:

\[
L = c \gamma \tau
\]

Here, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. The probability of survival depends on the ratio of the detector radius \( R \) to the decay length \( L \).

### Step 1: Initial Case (\( \gamma = 20 \), \( P = \frac{1}{3} \))
For the initial scenario, where \( \gamma = 20 \) and \( P = \frac{1}{3} \), we solve for \( c \tau \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}
\]

\[
-1.0986 = -\frac{30}{20 c \tau}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
20 c \tau = \frac{30}{1.0986} \approx 27.3 \, \text{meters}
\]

\[
c \tau \approx \frac{27.3}{20} \approx 1.365 \, \text{meters}
\]

### Step 2: New Case (\( P = \frac{2}{3} \))
For the new scenario, where \( P = \frac{2}{3} \), we solve for \( \gamma \):

\[
\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau}
\]

\[
-0.4055 = -\frac{30}{\gamma \cdot (c \tau)}
\]

Substituting \( c \tau \approx 1.365 \):

\[
-0.4055 = -\frac{30}{\gamma \cdot 1.365}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\gamma \cdot 1.365 = \frac{30}{0.4055} \approx 74.0
\]

\[
\gamma \approx \frac{74.0}{1.365} \approx 54.17
\]

### Final Answer
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately \( \gamma = 54 \). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
