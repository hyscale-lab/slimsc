Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. I've heard that it's typically around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this problem is mixing multiple solutions, so it's a bit more complicated.

First, I should figure out the moles of each acid and base involved. The solutions given are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh wait, wait. Ba(OH)2 is a base, and the others are acids. So I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess because neutralization depends on the limiting reactant.

Let me break it down step by step.

Calculate moles for each solution.

Starting with HCl: It's a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+.

Volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. So moles = Molarity * Volume. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. So 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's sulfuric acid, which is a strong acid as well, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives 2 moles of H+.

Volume is 300 mL (0.3 L) and concentration is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. So H+ from this is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

Volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentration 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So now, comparing the H+ and OH- moles.

H+ total: 0.28, OH-: 0.2. So H+ is in excess. The OH- will neutralize some of the H+.

The reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. The amount of heat depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

The limiting reagent here is OH- because it's 0.2 moles. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So the neutralization will proceed until either the OH- is used up or the H+ is.

So moles of H+ neutralized: 0.2. So the remaining H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But that's not needed for the enthalpy calculation because only the neutralized part contributes.

The enthalpy for neutralization is typically calculated per mole of H+ or OH- reacted. Since the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. So each mole of H+ and OH- combining gives -57 kJ.

Wait wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. The enthalpy of neutralization is the heat per mole of acid or base? Let me think. For a monoprotic acid and base, it's -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

In this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. So total enthalpy would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ. Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because sulfuric acid is diprotic, but in the initial calculation, I've accounted for the two H+ ions.

Wait, but when you have H2SO4 in solution, the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second one is strong as well, right? Or is the second one weak? I think for concentrated solutions, the second H+ isn't as strong, but in dilute solutions like 0.3 M, it's often considered that both dissociate. Wait, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, which is the heat when acid and base react. So regardless of the strength, all the H+ from the acids and OH- from the base will react as much as possible.

So in this case, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So 0.28 moles H+ total, 0.2 moles OH-.

So all 0.2 OH- will react, using up 0.2 H+.

So the reaction is: 0.2 moles H+ + 0.2 moles OH- → 0.2 moles H2O.

Each mole of H2O formation releases 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative).

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57,000 J) → because 57 kJ is 57,000 J. Wait, wait, no, the question's options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Which is approximately -11.4 kJ. Hmm, but the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, so perhaps I should convert kJ to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So if the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, converting to kcal would be -11.4 / 4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal. Because 4.184 * 2.72 is around 11.4.

Wait, let me calculate: 4 * 2.72 = 10.88, 0.184 * 2.72 ≈ 0.500. So total about 11.38, which is about 11.4 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal. But since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy is negative.

So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Total H+ available: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

Enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ (or -57,000 J). So 0.2 * (-57,000) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ. Converting to kcal: -11.4 / 4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal.

So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but another thought: is the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid or per mole of H+?

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is defined as the enthalpy change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base to form water. For strong acids and strong bases, it's approximately -57 kJ per mole of acid (since each acid donates one H+). But H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when it reacts, each mole can donate two H+.

Wait, so when H2SO4 is neutralized, each mole releases 2 * 57 kJ? Or wait, no. Because for each mole of H2SO4, it can provide two moles of H+, so each mole would release 2 * 57 kJ? But wait, that's not accurate. Because the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ ion neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So each mole of H+ requires one mole of OH- to make H2O, releasing 57 kJ.

So in this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, so 0.2 * 57 kJ is 11.4 kJ released, so -11.4 kJ. But the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is almost the same if I compute 11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, wait, 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184 (since 1 kcal = 4184 J). So 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.724 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.724 kcal, which rounds to -2.72 kcal. So option A.

Wait, but I thought the enthalpy would be -11.4 kJ, which would be option D (-16.0 kJ is not close), but option D is 16 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but another angle: perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but each mole gives two OH-; but when it neutralizes, it's two moles of H+ per mole of Ba(OH)2. Wait, no, the neutralization is on a 1:1 basis of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but the way I calculated before is correct. So if 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, that's 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a larger value. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting.

So 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

Each mole releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options except D is close, but D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy per mole is different. Perhaps for each mole of H2O, it's -57 kJ, but when you have strong acids and bases, it's more like -57 kJ per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but the standard value is -57 kJ per mole of H2O. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But option B is -11.42 kcal. Let's see: 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -2.72 kcal is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? Oh wait, maybe I confused kJ and kcal in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, not kcal. But the options have both. So let me see.

Wait, another aspect: perhaps the neutralization isn't only for the acid and base, but for the overall reaction, considering stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: write the net ionic equations.

HCl is H+ + Cl^-.

H2SO4 is 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when you mix, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH^- from Ba(OH)2.

The reaction: H+ + OH^- → H2O.

So moles of H+ available: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Moles of OH^-: 0.2.

Moles of H+ neutralized: 0.2.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options is exactly that. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating something.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the H2SO4 is not a strong acid in this context. Wait, but the problem states it's 0.3 M H2SO4. I think in dilute solutions, it's a strong acid, but maybe in this case, only the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second is weak. But the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, which probably assumes full dissociation for both.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry differently. For example, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, it's a 1:1 molar ratio because each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, the neutralization is between H+ from all acids and OH- from the base. So it's a general neutralization, not specific to any acid-base pair. So the approach I took earlier should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents of H+ = (0.1 + 0.18) = 0.28 eq (since each H+ is one equivalent).

Equivalents of OH- = 0.2 * 1 (since each OH- is one equivalent) → 0.2 eq.

So the neutralization is limited by OH- (0.2 eq).

So 0.2 equivalents of H+ and OH- react. So the heat is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Wait, wait, looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11400 J, which in kcal is 11400 / 4184 = approximately 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be 11.42 kcal, which is 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. Which would be more than the 11.4 kJ I calculated. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed that H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole, but I accounted for that. So no, I don't think that's an issue.

Another angle: perhaps the total volume is considered for the concentration of the solution, but enthalpy is per mole of reaction, not per volume. So it shouldn't affect the moles.

Wait, another idea: maybe the reaction isn't just H+ + OH- → H2O, but something else because of the presence of Ba^2+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, for example, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction could be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, that would be a metathesis reaction. Let's write the full equation.

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l).

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

The enthalpy for this reaction would be the sum of the neutralization enthalpies, plus any lattice energies or such. Hmm, but calculating that would require more data than given in the problem. So perhaps the question is expecting a simpler approach, treating each H+ with each OH-.

Wait, but if the problem mixes all three solutions, perhaps the HCl and H2SO4 are both acids and Ba(OH)2 is the base. So the net reaction is the combination of all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 reacting with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the initial approach is correct.

So back to the calculation: 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, releasing 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options match that exactly. The options are:

A: -2.72 kcal → ~-11.4 kJ.

So A is -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal, so option A is correct. So why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be about -47.7 kJ, which is higher.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recheck.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles → correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 → correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 → correct.

So yes, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28.

So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2, leading to 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So converting that to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the answer is -2.72 kcal, option A.

But then why is option B present? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so perhaps it contributes more OH- than I calculated. Wait, no, I accounted for 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 giving 0.2 moles of OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is in kJ, so the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use 57 kcal/mol instead of kJ. Wait, no, 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal (since 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.6). Wait, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the standard enthalpy of neutralization.

Standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of water is formed from an acid and a base. For strong acids and strong bases, it's about -57 kJ per mole of H2O. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, or -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer should be option A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.8 kJ. That's way off. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 OH-.

So correct.

So the neutralization is 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Convert to kcal: 11,400 J / 4,184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal. So enthalpy is -2.72 kcal → option A.

So the correct answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is a strong acid and diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total \( \text{OH}^- = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it will neutralize \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) formed.  
     Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) to form \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}_2\text{O} \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Convert \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Evaluate the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it corresponds to approximately \( -47.7 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far from the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
