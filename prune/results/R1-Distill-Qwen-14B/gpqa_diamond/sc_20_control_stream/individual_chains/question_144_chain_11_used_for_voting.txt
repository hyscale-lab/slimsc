Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and I need to find its mean decay distance. Hmm, mesons are subatomic particles, right? I remember they're made of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in meters, so it's a length measurement.

Wait, I think the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay distance (L) is given by L = v * τ * c, where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, I think the formula might actually be L = (v * c) * τ. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently.

I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, in particle physics, I think Γ is often given in energy units, so the formula might involve some constants.

Also, the velocity v of the particle depends on its energy and mass. Since E_X is given, which is 8 GeV, and the rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, the particle is moving relativistically. So I need to find v in terms of E and m. 

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E/(m c²). Once I have γ, I can find the velocity v using v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) or maybe another formula. Alternatively, since the particle is moving at a high speed, v is approximately c multiplied by sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the beta factor β = v/c. β is given by sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Let me compute that.

So, m_X is 1.2 GeV, E_X is 8 GeV. Let's compute (m_X c²)/(E_X c²) = (1.2)/(8) = 0.15. So 1 - (0.15)^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root gives sqrt(0.9775). Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, more precisely, Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, in natural units where ħ = c = 1, these have units of GeV and inverse GeV (which is time when ħ is included). So I need to make sure to convert units properly.

Wait, let's think about units. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, wait, no, because 6.582e-25 GeV s divided by 0.32 GeV gives (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So yes, when you divide by Γ in GeV, you get time in seconds. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25) / (0.32) s. Let me compute that more accurately: 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 3.2e-1 = 6.582 / 3.2 * 1e-24 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now the decay length L is v * τ. Since v is in terms of c, so L = β c τ. Let me compute that.

β is approximately 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s. So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s. Let me compute that. 

First, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 × 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625 × 1e-16 m. Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.113e-16 m.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options are in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. Let me think again. My calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recompute beta more accurately. So (m_X)/(E_X) is 1.2 /8 = 0.15. So (m_X c²)/(E_X c²) = 0.15. So 1 - (0.15)^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is not exactly 0.9887. Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculating sqrt(0.9775): Let's see, 0.9887 squared is (approx) 0.9776, so yes, 0.9887 is correct. So no mistake there.

Then, tau is around 2.056875e-24 seconds. Multiplying by beta (0.9887) and c (3e8 m/s):

L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.1e-16 m.

Wait, but the options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.06e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.06e-16.

Hmm, none of these match 6.1e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let's recheck gamma. Gamma is E/(m c^2) in natural units, where c=1. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Wait, so the velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667)^2)).

Calculating 1/(6.6667)^2: 6.6667 is 20/3, so square is (400/9)≈44.444, so 1/44.444≈0.0225. So 1-0.0225=0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887, as before. So no mistake in beta.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Let me recheck. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = hbar / Gamma. Hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV s. So tau = (6.582e-25) / (0.32) GeV s / GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The decay width Γ is related to the total decay rate, but when calculating the mean lifetime, it's tau = ħ / Γ. Yes, that part is correct.

So L = beta c tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this more precisely.

3e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s is 3 * 2.056875 =6.170625, so 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.1e-16 m. Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the decay length using another approach. Or perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta. Wait, no, it's L = beta c tau. Since beta is v/c, so v = beta c. So decay length is v * tau = beta c tau.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are different. Alternatively, maybe I used the wrong units for the decay width.

Wait, the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. That's correct. So tau is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic gamma factor for the lifetime. Because when a particle is moving, its lifetime from the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Wait, but the mean lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the rest frame. The lab frame's lifetime is longer by gamma. So perhaps I'm supposed to multiply tau by gamma.

Wait, that's a crucial point! Because the decay width Γ is the same in all frames, but the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times tau.

Wait, no, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is energy-related. The lifetime tau is in the rest frame. So when the particle is moving, from the lab frame's perspective, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the mean lifetime observed is gamma * tau.

Ah, I think I missed that. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma times tau. So the decay length L = v * (gamma tau).

Because from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer. So the formula should be L = beta c gamma tau.

Because the lifetime is gamma tau, and velocity is beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, so perhaps I missed the gamma factor in the previous calculation. Let me recalculate.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, earlier I computed L as beta c tau. So I need to now include gamma in the calculation.

So, let's recalculate:

beta ≈ 0.9887, gamma ≈6.6667.

So, L = beta c gamma tau.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So compute:

beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

Then, c is 3e8 m/s.

So, L = 6.591 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591:

6.170625e-16 *6.591 ≈ approx 40.8e-16 m. Wait, that's 4.08e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.08e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is 5.02e-15. Hmm, 4.08e-15 is close to option B.

But wait, let me recompute the product more accurately.

Compute 6.591 * 6.170625e-16:

6.591 *6 =39.546,

6.591 *0.170625= approx 1.125.

So total ≈40.671e-16 m =4.0671e-15 m. Which is about 4.07e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15. That's very close. So the correct answer is option B.

So where did I go wrong before? I forgot to account for the time dilation factor (gamma) in the lifetime. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so the decay length increases by gamma. Hence, the correct calculation includes gamma.

To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relativistic energy relation is \( E = \gamma m c^2 \). Given \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), the Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) in the lab frame is given by:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we compute:

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
3 \times 2.056875 = 6.170625 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Next, multiply by \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.591
\]

\[
L = 6.591 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
