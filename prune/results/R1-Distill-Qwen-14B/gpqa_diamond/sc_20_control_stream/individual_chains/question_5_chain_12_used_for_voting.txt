Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

First, I should figure out what the operator P looks like when it's along an arbitrary direction. Oh right, for a direction n, the operator is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. So if n is in the x-z plane, it means the y-component of n is zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. 

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. In the x-z plane, the direction n would have components (n_x, 0, n_z). So the direction is such that the y-component is zero. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, and n_y is 0.

So the operator P along direction n, P_n, is given by P · n. That is, P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, P_y doesn't contribute.

Now, I need to compute P_n. Let's write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting:

n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Breaking it down into matrices:

P_x matrix is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Multiply by ħ/2:
P_x = ħ/2 * [ [0,1],[1,0] ]

Similarly, P_z matrix is:
[ [1,0], [0,-1] ]
Multiply by ħ/2: P_z = ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [0,1;1,0] + cosθ * [1,0;0,-1] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So the matrix for P_n is:

ħ/2 * [
[ cosθ, sinθ ],
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]
]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

An eigenvector v satisfies P_n v = (ħ/2) v.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator P_n has eigenvalues. Let me think about that.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = λ |v>. Here, we're told that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So λ is ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, let me write it as a matrix equation.

Divide both sides by ħ/2 (since it's non-zero), we get:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a
[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So two equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0 => (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0 => sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

So now, we have two equations:

(1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

(2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

[ (cosθ -1)      sinθ        ] [a]   = [0]
[ sinθ         (-cosθ -1) ] [b]      [0]

But for a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Let me compute the determinant:

D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Expanding:

= ( -cos^2θ - cosθ + cosθ +1 ) - sin²θ

Wait, no, let me compute (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):

Multiply (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -cosθ (cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1)
= -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ +1
= -cos²θ +1

So D = (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ

But 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ, so D = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

Ah, so the determinant is zero, which means the system has non-trivial solutions. So we can pick one equation to find the ratio of a and b.

Let's take equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Let me solve for a in terms of b.

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b => a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Simplify denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -(2 sin²(theta/2)), since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( - 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] b

Simplify numerator: -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Denominator: -2 sin²(theta/2)

So:

a = [ (-2 sin cos) / (-2 sin^2) ) ] b = [ (2 sin cos) / (2 sin^2) ) ] b = [ cos / sin ] b = cot(theta/2) * b

Wait, let me compute again:

The numerator is - sinθ, denominator is (cosθ -1).

Alternatively, perhaps we can write a in terms of b:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Because:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Now, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] b 

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b 

= cot(theta/2) b 

So a = cot(theta/2) * b 

Let me write this ratio as a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b 

Alternatively, a = cot(theta/2) b.

But perhaps it's easier to set b = 1 and find a, but let's see.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] 

We can factor out b: b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

Alternatively, let me set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2) * sin(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2). So a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2).

Wait, that would make the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, let me check. Let me suppose a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2). Then equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = (cosθ -1) cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2 )

Let me compute this:

We can use trigonometric identities.

cos(theta) = 2 cos²(theta/2) - 1.

So cos(theta) -1 = 2 cos²(theta/2) - 2 = 2 (cos²(theta/2) - 1 )= -2 sin²(theta/2).

So equation (1) becomes:

(-2 sin²(theta/2)) * cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2 )

Hmm, and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

(-2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) + [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2 )

= -2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

Which equals zero. So yes, this satisfies equation (1).

Similarly, equation (2):

sinθ a - cosθ b -b = 0.

Substituting a and b:

sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ * sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) = ?

Compute sinθ cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2).

cos(theta) sin(theta/2) = [ 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ] sin(theta/2) = 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2).

So equation (2) becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - [ 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] - sin(theta/2) 

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)

= 0 + 0 = 0.

Yes, it works.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, but we need to normalize it.

Wait, what is the length of the vector? The length squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1. So it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, let me read them again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. The eigenvector components should be dimensionless, right? Because the operator is in terms of ħ, which is a constant with units of J·s. So the eigenvectors are in a Hilbert space, so they should be dimensionless.

Looking back, in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which fits with what I found.

But wait, let me look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, the operator given is in the x-z plane, so phi would be zero or something? Hmm.

But the problem didn't specify phi, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the eigenvector is to be found for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction has polar angle theta from the z-axis, but phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing: the operator is P along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the spin operator S (or P here) for a spin-½ particle.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the operator P given here is probably analogous to the spin operator S. Because in quantum mechanics, the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the same idea applies here.

In that case, the eigenvector for S_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be along the direction n.

In the case of spin-½, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n. The spin-up state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I found.

So the normalized eigenvector has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Operator Setup**: The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:
   - $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
   - $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
   - $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

   For a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is the unit vector in spherical coordinates. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the operator becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   where $+\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue. Substituting the matrix form of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving the Eigenvalue System**: The equations are:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0,
   \]
   \[
   \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero, which is satisfied. Solving for $a$ and $b$, we find that the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The length of the eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**: Comparing with the given options:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect, as it includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is not dimensionless.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect, as it involves $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which do not match the derived eigenvector.
   - **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

First, I should figure out what the operator P looks like when it's along an arbitrary direction. Oh right, for a direction n, the operator is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. So if n is in the x-z plane, it means the y-component of n is zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. 

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. In the x-z plane, the direction n would have components (n_x, 0, n_z). So the direction is such that the y-component is zero. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, and n_y is 0.

So the operator P along direction n, P_n, is given by P · n. That is, P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, P_y doesn't contribute.

Now, I need to compute P_n. Let's write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting:

n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Breaking it down into matrices:

P_x matrix is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Multiply by ħ/2:
P_x = ħ/2 * [ [0,1],[1,0] ]

Similarly, P_z matrix is:
[ [1,0], [0,-1] ]
Multiply by ħ/2: P_z = ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [0,1;1,0] + cosθ * [1,0;0,-1] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So the matrix for P_n is:

ħ/2 * [
[ cosθ, sinθ ],
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]
]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

An eigenvector v satisfies P_n v = (ħ/2) v.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator P_n has eigenvalues. Let me think about that.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = λ |v>. Here, we're told that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So λ is ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, let me write it as a matrix equation.

Divide both sides by ħ/2 (since it's non-zero), we get:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a
[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So two equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0 => (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0 => sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

So now, we have two equations:

(1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

(2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can write this as a homogeneous system:

[ (cosθ -1)      sinθ        ] [a]   = [0]
[ sinθ         (-cosθ -1) ] [b]      [0]

But for a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Let me compute the determinant:

D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Expanding:

= ( -cos^2θ - cosθ + cosθ +1 ) - sin²θ

Wait, no, let me compute (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):

Multiply (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -cosθ (cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1)
= -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ +1
= -cos²θ +1

So D = (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ

But 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ, so D = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

Ah, so the determinant is zero, which means the system has non-trivial solutions. So we can pick one equation to find the ratio of a and b.

Let's take equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Let me solve for a in terms of b.

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b => a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Simplify denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -(2 sin²(theta/2)), since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( - 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] b

Simplify numerator: -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Denominator: -2 sin²(theta/2)

So:

a = [ (-2 sin cos) / (-2 sin^2) ) ] b = [ (2 sin cos) / (2 sin^2) ) ] b = [ cos / sin ] b = cot(theta/2) * b

Wait, let me compute again:

The numerator is - sinθ, denominator is (cosθ -1).

Alternatively, perhaps we can write a in terms of b:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Because:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Now, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] b 

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b 

= cot(theta/2) b 

So a = cot(theta/2) * b 

Let me write this ratio as a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b 

Alternatively, a = cot(theta/2) b.

But perhaps it's easier to set b = 1 and find a, but let's see.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] 

We can factor out b: b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

Alternatively, let me set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2) * sin(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2). So a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2).

Wait, that would make the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, let me check. Let me suppose a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2). Then equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = (cosθ -1) cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2 )

Let me compute this:

We can use trigonometric identities.

cos(theta) = 2 cos²(theta/2) - 1.

So cos(theta) -1 = 2 cos²(theta/2) - 2 = 2 (cos²(theta/2) - 1 )= -2 sin²(theta/2).

So equation (1) becomes:

(-2 sin²(theta/2)) * cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2 )

Hmm, and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

(-2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) + [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2 )

= -2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

Which equals zero. So yes, this satisfies equation (1).

Similarly, equation (2):

sinθ a - cosθ b -b = 0.

Substituting a and b:

sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ * sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) = ?

Compute sinθ cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2).

cos(theta) sin(theta/2) = [ 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ] sin(theta/2) = 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2).

So equation (2) becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - [ 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] - sin(theta/2) 

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) + sin(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)

= 0 + 0 = 0.

Yes, it works.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, but we need to normalize it.

Wait, what is the length of the vector? The length squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1. So it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, let me read them again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. The eigenvector components should be dimensionless, right? Because the operator is in terms of ħ, which is a constant with units of J·s. So the eigenvectors are in a Hilbert space, so they should be dimensionless.

Looking back, in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which fits with what I found.

But wait, let me look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, the operator given is in the x-z plane, so phi would be zero or something? Hmm.

But the problem didn't specify phi, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the eigenvector is to be found for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction has polar angle theta from the z-axis, but phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing: the operator is P along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the spin operator S (or P here) for a spin-½ particle.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the operator P given here is probably analogous to the spin operator S. Because in quantum mechanics, the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the same idea applies here.

In that case, the eigenvector for S_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be along the direction n.

In the case of spin-½, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n. The spin-up state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what I found.

So the normalized eigenvector has components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Operator Setup**: The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:
   - $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
   - $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
   - $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

   For a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is the unit vector in spherical coordinates. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the operator becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   where $+\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue. Substituting the matrix form of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Solving the Eigenvalue System**: The equations are:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0,
   \]
   \[
   \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero, which is satisfied. Solving for $a$ and $b$, we find that the eigenvector is proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The length of the eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**: Comparing with the given options:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect, as it includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is not dimensionless.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect, as it involves $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which do not match the derived eigenvector.
   - **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
