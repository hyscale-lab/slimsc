Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully and figure out what's going on.

So, the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots are present, 40% of the surface is covered, and the effective temperature of the photosphere drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. The problem involves the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this problem, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe the far-ultraviolet. Let me calculate the energy difference between the two levels.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So, E = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, in terms of temperature, we can relate the energy to thermal energy via k*T. Since Boltzmann's factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), I can write it as exp( - (hc/(λ k T)) ).

But wait, hc/(λ k) would give a term in units of energy over energy, so a dimensionless number. Let me compute this term.

Calculating hc/(k) first: h is 6.626e-34 J s, c is 3e8 m/s. So, hc is 1.9878e-25 J m. k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K. So, hc/(k) is 1.9878e-25 / 1.38e-23 = approximately 0.0144 meters per Kelvin.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The term (hc)/(λ k T) is dimensionless. Let me compute hc/(λ k T) for both temperatures.

Wait, for each temperature, T is 6000 K and 5500 K. Let me compute this term for each.

First, for T = 6000 K:

hc/(λ k T) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K )

Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K.

Multiply the constants:

1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30 = approx 2. * 1e-30? Wait, 1.448 * 1.38 is roughly 2 (since 1.4*1.4 is about 2). Let me compute it more accurately. 1.448 * 1.38: 1*1=1, 1*0.38=0.38, 0.448*1=0.448, 0.448*0.38=0.170. So adding up 1 + 0.38 + 0.448 + 0.170 = 2.0 (approx). So 2e-30 J·m/K.

But wait, the denominator is (1.448e-7 m) * (1.38e-23 J/K) * (6000 K) = (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * 6e3) J·m.

Wait, 1.448e-7 * 6e3 = 1.448e-7 * 6e3 = 1.448 * 6e-4 = 8.688e-4 m.

Then, 8.688e-4 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 8.688e-4 *1.38e-23 = approx 1.2e-26 J·m.

So the denominator is 1.2e-26 J·m.

Wait, maybe I should recompute this more accurately. Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator = λ * k * T = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K.

Multiply 1.448e-7 by 6000: 1.448e-7 *6e3 = 1.448e-4 m.

Then, 1.448e-4 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 *1.38 = approx 2, so 2e-27 J·m.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this as a single calculation.

Compute hc/(λ k T) for T=6000 K.

h = 6.626e-34 J s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1.448e-7 m
k = 1.38e-23 J/K
T = 6000 K

So,

hc/(λ k T) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 *6e3)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = 1.448 *1.38 = 2. * 1e-30 (since 1e-7 *1e-23=1e-30)

Wait, 1.448 *1.38 is about 2. So 2e-30.

Multiply by 6e3: 2e-30 *6e3 = 1.2e-26.

So, denominator is 1.2e-26 J·m.

So, hc/(λ k T) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.2e-26) = approx 16.56.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.2e-26 is about 16.56.

So, that's hc/(λ k T) = ~16.56.

Then, for T=6000 K, the exponent is -16.56.

But wait, that's a big number. So the exponential term would be very small, because exp(-16.56) is a tiny number. Hmm, that seems odd. Let me think: for a given energy, when the temperature is high, the exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio would be larger.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute again.

Another approach: Let me compute hc/(λ k T) as (hc/(k)) * (1/(λ T)).

We can compute hc/(k) first.

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So hc/(k) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.38e-23 = approx 0.0144 m/K.

So, hc/(k) ≈ 0.0144 m/K.

Then, (hc/(k)) * (1/(λ T)) = 0.0144 m/K * 1/(λ T)

So, for λ = 1.448e-7 m, T = 6000 K.

1/(λ T) = 1/(1.448e-7 m *6000 K) = 1/(8.688e-4 m·K) ≈ 1.151e3 K/m.

So, hc/(λ k T) = 0.0144 m/K * 1.151e3 K/m = 0.0144 *1.151e3.

0.0144 * 1000 is 14.4, so 0.0144 *1151 ≈ 16.56.

Yes, same as before. So the exponent is about -16.56, which is a very small number. So n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-16.56), which is like 1.9e-7.

Wait, but this seems way too small. Let me check: exp(-16) is about 1.1e-7, so yes, about 1e-7.

Wait, but when the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes larger in magnitude (more negative), so the ratio would be even smaller. Because T is lower, so if T drops, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio would decrease.

The problem states that when the star has spots, 40% of its surface is covered, and the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So in this case, the exponent is hc/(λ k T). So for T=5500 K:

Compute hc/(λ k T) for T=5500.

We can compute this as before.

hc/(k) is 0.0144 m/K as before.

So, hc/(k) * 1/(lambda T) for lambda=1.448e-7 m, T=5500.

1/(lambda T) = 1/(1.448e-7 m *5500 K) = 1/(8.014e-4 m·K) ≈ 1.248e3 K/m.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 0.0144 m/K * 1.248e3 K/m = 0.0144 *1248 ≈ 18.0.

Wait, 1248 * 0.0144: 1248 *0.01 is 12.48, 1248 *0.0044=5.5952. So sum is 18.0752. So approximately 18.08.

So the exponent becomes -18.08.

So the ratio n2/n1 for T=6000K is exp(-16.56) ≈ 8.4e-7.

For T=5500K, it's exp(-18.08) ≈ 1.2e-8.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 (n2 is higher energy level) decreases.

So the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which means when T is lower. So that makes sense because the exponential term becomes smaller.

The question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So, factor = (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Which would be [exp(-16.56) ] / [ exp(-18.08) ) ] = exp(1.52).

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents: exp(a)/exp(b)=exp(a-b).

So a is -16.56, b is -18.08. a - b = (-16.56) - (-18.08) = 1.52.

So exp(1.52) is approximately equal to about 4.57.

Because e^1.6 is about 4.95, and e^1.5 is about 4.48. So 1.52 is between, around 4.57.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this value.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes. Let me re-calculate the exponents.

For T=6000 K:

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

Compute hc/(lambda k T) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * 6e3 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = 1.993e-30. Multiply by 6e3: 1.993e-30 *6e3 = 1.196e-26.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.196e-26 = approximately 16.61.

So exp(-16.61) ≈ 8.3e-7.

For T=5500 K:

Denominator (lambda k T) = 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 *5500 = 1.448e-7 *7.59e-20 = let me compute that.

1.448e-7 *5.5e3 = 1.448e-7 *5.5e3 = 1.448 *5.5e-4 = 7.964e-4.

Then, 7.964e-4 *1.38e-23 = 1.097e-26.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.9878e-25 /1.097e-26 = approx 18.12.

So exp(-18.12) ≈ 1.3e-8.

So the ratio factor is (8.3e-7) / (1.3e-8) = approximately 63.8.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, 8.3e-7 divided by 1.3e-8 is (8.3 / 1.3) * 1e1 = approx 6.38 *10 = 63.8.

But that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because according to this calculation, the factor is about 63, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the levels. Wait, the ratio observed is n1/n2, not n2/n1. Because the question states, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

Wait, let me recheck. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me define the ratio as R = (n1) / (n2). 

So, when spots are present, R decreases. So, R_spot < R_no_spots.

So when the star has spots, the ratio R is lower. Let's see what that implies.

Because without spots, T is higher, so the population in higher energy levels is higher. So n2 is higher, so R = n1/n2 would be lower when T is higher.

Wait, but when the star has spots, T is lower, leading R to be higher. Wait, no, because if T is lower, the higher energy level (level 2) is less populated. So n2 decreases, so n1/n2 would increase. But the problem says when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So perhaps I have the ratio in the reverse.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. Let me re-read the question.

The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2 or n2/n1) decreases.

Wait, considering that when the star has spots (T lower), if the ratio is n2/n1, then n2/n1 would decrease, because lower T means fewer atoms in higher energy levels. So if the ratio (n2/n1) decreases, then the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp(1.52) ~4.5, which is option C.

But according to the earlier calculation, the factor is about 63, not 4.5. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong energy. Let me double-check the energy term.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near-UV. The energy is E = hc/lambda.

I think I made a mistake in the calculation of hc/(lambda k T). Let me recompute this more accurately.

Compute hc/(lambda k T) for T=6000 K.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact, but approx 3e8 m/s)
lambda = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Compute numerator: h * c = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m.

Denominator: lambda * k * T = 1.448e-7 m * 1.380649e-23 J/K * 6000 K.

Compute the denominator step by step:

1.448e-7 m * 1.380649e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 * 1.380649e-23 = 1.996e-30 J·m/K.

Multiply by T=6000 K: 1.996e-30 *6000 = 1.1976e-26 J·m.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.1976e-26 = 16.59.

Similarly, for T=5500 K:

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.380649e-23 *5500 = 1.448e-7 *7.5935695e-20 = 1.104e-26.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.9864e-25 / 1.104e-26 = 18.0.

So the exponents are exp(-16.59) and exp(-18.0).

Compute the ratio of the ratios: [exp(-16.59) / exp(-18.0)] = exp(1.41) ≈ 4.1.

Wait, 1.41 is the exponent. e^1.41 is approximately 4.1.

Wait, this is because when you have (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spot) - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) )

Wait no, the ratio is ((n2/n1)_T=6000)/( (n2/n1)_T=5500) = [exp(-16.59) ] / [ exp(-18.0) ] = exp(1.41) ≈ 4.1.

Which is approximately 4.1, which is near option C (~4.5). But wait, my precise calculation gives 1.41, which is e^1.41 ≈ 4.1.

Wait, but the option C is ~4.5. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding, the correct answer is C.

But earlier I thought the ratio was 63, which was incorrect. So I must have made a mistake in what ratio I was computing.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when spots are present, T is lower, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher. So (n1/n2) increases.

So the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) ]

So the (g1/g2) cancels out. So it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_6000) - (E2-E1)/(k T_5500) )

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )

Which is the same as exp( (hc/(lambda k)) [1/6000 -1/5500 ] )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me compute it properly.

The exponent delta is (ΔE/(k))[ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Where T1=6000, T2=5500.

ΔE is the energy difference, hc/lambda.

So, ΔE/(k) is hc/(lambda k).

So, the exponent is (hc/(lambda k)) [1/6000 - 1/5500 ]

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1.

So, [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(3.3e7) )= approx -1.515e-5 K^-1.

Wait, 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000. So 5500-6000= -500.

So,  (1/6000 -1/5500)= -500/(33e6) )= -5/(33e3) )= -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (hc/(lambda k)) * (-1.515e-5).

Wait, but hc/(lambda k) is 16.59 for T=6000 K, but that's when the denominator is lambda k T. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, let me compute the exponent as (ΔE)/(k T_spot) - (ΔE)/(k T_no_spot) )

= (ΔE)/(k) [ 1/T_spot - 1/T_no_spot ]

Which is the same as (hc/(lambda k)) [ 1/T_spot - 1/T_no_spot ]

So, let's compute this.

We have T_spot =5500 K, T_no_spot=6000 K.

So,

exponent = (hc/(lambda k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ]

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4.

So, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33e6) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 )= approx 1.515e-5.

So, the exponent is (hc/(lambda k)) * 1.515e-5.

Wait, but what is hc/(lambda k)?

Earlier, we found that for T=6000 K, hc/(lambda k T) ≈16.59.

But hc/(lambda k) is 16.59 * T.

Wait, no, hc/(lambda k) = (hc/(lambda k T)) * T.

So, hc/(lambda k) = (16.59) *6000 K. That's going to be a huge number. But that can't be right, so perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exponent as (hc/(lambda k)) (1/T_spot -1/T_no_spot).

But hc/(lambda k) = (hc/(lambda k T)) * T.

So for T=6000 K, hc/(lambda k T)=16.59 → hc/(lambda k) = 16.59 *6000 = 99540 K.

So the exponent becomes 99540 * [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] = 99540*(1.515e-5) ≈ 99540 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.508.

So, the exponent is about 1.508.

Thus, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = exp(1.508) ≈ 4.5.

Ah, that's matching option C.

Wait, so I think I messed up the initial approach, but now it's clear.

So the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is higher, because higher T makes the exponential term larger, so n2 is more populated, making n1/n2 smaller. So when the star has spots (T lower), n1/n2 increases.

But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. That contradicts, so perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1). Because when T is higher, n2/n1 is higher, but when T is lower, the ratio decreases.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp(1.508) ≈4.5.

Which is option C. So the answer should be C) ~4.5.

Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$) is 6000 K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. The problem involves the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), which decreases when the star has spots. The goal is to determine the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of $\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}$, so the energy difference is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.

The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into this expression, the ratio becomes:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\Delta E / (kT)$
The energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$, $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$, and $\lambda = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}$. Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The term $\Delta E / (kT)$ is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})T}.
\]

For $T = 6000 \, \text{K}$:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(6000)} \approx 16.56.
\]

For $T = 5500 \, \text{K}$:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(5500)} \approx 18.08.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(16.56 - 18.08\right) = \exp(-1.52).
\]

The ratio $\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}} / \left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}$ is:

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully and figure out what's going on.

So, the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots are present, 40% of the surface is covered, and the effective temperature of the photosphere drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. The problem involves the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this problem, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe the far-ultraviolet. Let me calculate the energy difference between the two levels.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So, E = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, in terms of temperature, we can relate the energy to thermal energy via k*T. Since Boltzmann's factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), I can write it as exp( - (hc/(λ k T)) ).

But wait, hc/(λ k) would give a term in units of energy over energy, so a dimensionless number. Let me compute this term.

Calculating hc/(k) first: h is 6.626e-34 J s, c is 3e8 m/s. So, hc is 1.9878e-25 J m. k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K. So, hc/(k) is 1.9878e-25 / 1.38e-23 = approximately 0.0144 meters per Kelvin.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The term (hc)/(λ k T) is dimensionless. Let me compute hc/(λ k T) for both temperatures.

Wait, for each temperature, T is 6000 K and 5500 K. Let me compute this term for each.

First, for T = 6000 K:

hc/(λ k T) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K )

Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K.

Multiply the constants:

1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30 = approx 2. * 1e-30? Wait, 1.448 * 1.38 is roughly 2 (since 1.4*1.4 is about 2). Let me compute it more accurately. 1.448 * 1.38: 1*1=1, 1*0.38=0.38, 0.448*1=0.448, 0.448*0.38=0.170. So adding up 1 + 0.38 + 0.448 + 0.170 = 2.0 (approx). So 2e-30 J·m/K.

But wait, the denominator is (1.448e-7 m) * (1.38e-23 J/K) * (6000 K) = (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * 6e3) J·m.

Wait, 1.448e-7 * 6e3 = 1.448e-7 * 6e3 = 1.448 * 6e-4 = 8.688e-4 m.

Then, 8.688e-4 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 8.688e-4 *1.38e-23 = approx 1.2e-26 J·m.

So the denominator is 1.2e-26 J·m.

Wait, maybe I should recompute this more accurately. Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator = λ * k * T = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K.

Multiply 1.448e-7 by 6000: 1.448e-7 *6e3 = 1.448e-4 m.

Then, 1.448e-4 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448 *1.38 = approx 2, so 2e-27 J·m.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this as a single calculation.

Compute hc/(λ k T) for T=6000 K.

h = 6.626e-34 J s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1.448e-7 m
k = 1.38e-23 J/K
T = 6000 K

So,

hc/(λ k T) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 *6e3)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = 1.448 *1.38 = 2. * 1e-30 (since 1e-7 *1e-23=1e-30)

Wait, 1.448 *1.38 is about 2. So 2e-30.

Multiply by 6e3: 2e-30 *6e3 = 1.2e-26.

So, denominator is 1.2e-26 J·m.

So, hc/(λ k T) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.2e-26) = approx 16.56.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.2e-26 is about 16.56.

So, that's hc/(λ k T) = ~16.56.

Then, for T=6000 K, the exponent is -16.56.

But wait, that's a big number. So the exponential term would be very small, because exp(-16.56) is a tiny number. Hmm, that seems odd. Let me think: for a given energy, when the temperature is high, the exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio would be larger.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute again.

Another approach: Let me compute hc/(λ k T) as (hc/(k)) * (1/(λ T)).

We can compute hc/(k) first.

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So hc/(k) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.38e-23 = approx 0.0144 m/K.

So, hc/(k) ≈ 0.0144 m/K.

Then, (hc/(k)) * (1/(λ T)) = 0.0144 m/K * 1/(λ T)

So, for λ = 1.448e-7 m, T = 6000 K.

1/(λ T) = 1/(1.448e-7 m *6000 K) = 1/(8.688e-4 m·K) ≈ 1.151e3 K/m.

So, hc/(λ k T) = 0.0144 m/K * 1.151e3 K/m = 0.0144 *1.151e3.

0.0144 * 1000 is 14.4, so 0.0144 *1151 ≈ 16.56.

Yes, same as before. So the exponent is about -16.56, which is a very small number. So n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-16.56), which is like 1.9e-7.

Wait, but this seems way too small. Let me check: exp(-16) is about 1.1e-7, so yes, about 1e-7.

Wait, but when the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes larger in magnitude (more negative), so the ratio would be even smaller. Because T is lower, so if T drops, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio would decrease.

The problem states that when the star has spots, 40% of its surface is covered, and the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So in this case, the exponent is hc/(λ k T). So for T=5500 K:

Compute hc/(λ k T) for T=5500.

We can compute this as before.

hc/(k) is 0.0144 m/K as before.

So, hc/(k) * 1/(lambda T) for lambda=1.448e-7 m, T=5500.

1/(lambda T) = 1/(1.448e-7 m *5500 K) = 1/(8.014e-4 m·K) ≈ 1.248e3 K/m.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 0.0144 m/K * 1.248e3 K/m = 0.0144 *1248 ≈ 18.0.

Wait, 1248 * 0.0144: 1248 *0.01 is 12.48, 1248 *0.0044=5.5952. So sum is 18.0752. So approximately 18.08.

So the exponent becomes -18.08.

So the ratio n2/n1 for T=6000K is exp(-16.56) ≈ 8.4e-7.

For T=5500K, it's exp(-18.08) ≈ 1.2e-8.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 (n2 is higher energy level) decreases.

So the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which means when T is lower. So that makes sense because the exponential term becomes smaller.

The question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So, factor = (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

Which would be [exp(-16.56) ] / [ exp(-18.08) ) ] = exp(1.52).

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents: exp(a)/exp(b)=exp(a-b).

So a is -16.56, b is -18.08. a - b = (-16.56) - (-18.08) = 1.52.

So exp(1.52) is approximately equal to about 4.57.

Because e^1.6 is about 4.95, and e^1.5 is about 4.48. So 1.52 is between, around 4.57.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this value.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes. Let me re-calculate the exponents.

For T=6000 K:

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

Compute hc/(lambda k T) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * 6e3 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = 1.993e-30. Multiply by 6e3: 1.993e-30 *6e3 = 1.196e-26.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.196e-26 = approximately 16.61.

So exp(-16.61) ≈ 8.3e-7.

For T=5500 K:

Denominator (lambda k T) = 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 *5500 = 1.448e-7 *7.59e-20 = let me compute that.

1.448e-7 *5.5e3 = 1.448e-7 *5.5e3 = 1.448 *5.5e-4 = 7.964e-4.

Then, 7.964e-4 *1.38e-23 = 1.097e-26.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.9878e-25 /1.097e-26 = approx 18.12.

So exp(-18.12) ≈ 1.3e-8.

So the ratio factor is (8.3e-7) / (1.3e-8) = approximately 63.8.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, 8.3e-7 divided by 1.3e-8 is (8.3 / 1.3) * 1e1 = approx 6.38 *10 = 63.8.

But that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because according to this calculation, the factor is about 63, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the levels. Wait, the ratio observed is n1/n2, not n2/n1. Because the question states, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

Wait, let me recheck. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me define the ratio as R = (n1) / (n2). 

So, when spots are present, R decreases. So, R_spot < R_no_spots.

So when the star has spots, the ratio R is lower. Let's see what that implies.

Because without spots, T is higher, so the population in higher energy levels is higher. So n2 is higher, so R = n1/n2 would be lower when T is higher.

Wait, but when the star has spots, T is lower, leading R to be higher. Wait, no, because if T is lower, the higher energy level (level 2) is less populated. So n2 decreases, so n1/n2 would increase. But the problem says when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So perhaps I have the ratio in the reverse.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1. Let me re-read the question.

The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2 or n2/n1) decreases.

Wait, considering that when the star has spots (T lower), if the ratio is n2/n1, then n2/n1 would decrease, because lower T means fewer atoms in higher energy levels. So if the ratio (n2/n1) decreases, then the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp(1.52) ~4.5, which is option C.

But according to the earlier calculation, the factor is about 63, not 4.5. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong energy. Let me double-check the energy term.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near-UV. The energy is E = hc/lambda.

I think I made a mistake in the calculation of hc/(lambda k T). Let me recompute this more accurately.

Compute hc/(lambda k T) for T=6000 K.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact, but approx 3e8 m/s)
lambda = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Compute numerator: h * c = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m.

Denominator: lambda * k * T = 1.448e-7 m * 1.380649e-23 J/K * 6000 K.

Compute the denominator step by step:

1.448e-7 m * 1.380649e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 * 1.380649e-23 = 1.996e-30 J·m/K.

Multiply by T=6000 K: 1.996e-30 *6000 = 1.1976e-26 J·m.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.1976e-26 = 16.59.

Similarly, for T=5500 K:

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.380649e-23 *5500 = 1.448e-7 *7.5935695e-20 = 1.104e-26.

So hc/(lambda k T) = 1.9864e-25 / 1.104e-26 = 18.0.

So the exponents are exp(-16.59) and exp(-18.0).

Compute the ratio of the ratios: [exp(-16.59) / exp(-18.0)] = exp(1.41) ≈ 4.1.

Wait, 1.41 is the exponent. e^1.41 is approximately 4.1.

Wait, this is because when you have (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spot) - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) )

Wait no, the ratio is ((n2/n1)_T=6000)/( (n2/n1)_T=5500) = [exp(-16.59) ] / [ exp(-18.0) ] = exp(1.41) ≈ 4.1.

Which is approximately 4.1, which is near option C (~4.5). But wait, my precise calculation gives 1.41, which is e^1.41 ≈ 4.1.

Wait, but the option C is ~4.5. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding, the correct answer is C.

But earlier I thought the ratio was 63, which was incorrect. So I must have made a mistake in what ratio I was computing.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when spots are present, T is lower, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher. So (n1/n2) increases.

So the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) ]

So the (g1/g2) cancels out. So it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_6000) - (E2-E1)/(k T_5500) )

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] )

Which is the same as exp( (hc/(lambda k)) [1/6000 -1/5500 ] )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me compute it properly.

The exponent delta is (ΔE/(k))[ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Where T1=6000, T2=5500.

ΔE is the energy difference, hc/lambda.

So, ΔE/(k) is hc/(lambda k).

So, the exponent is (hc/(lambda k)) [1/6000 - 1/5500 ]

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1.

So, [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(3.3e7) )= approx -1.515e-5 K^-1.

Wait, 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000. So 5500-6000= -500.

So,  (1/6000 -1/5500)= -500/(33e6) )= -5/(33e3) )= -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (hc/(lambda k)) * (-1.515e-5).

Wait, but hc/(lambda k) is 16.59 for T=6000 K, but that's when the denominator is lambda k T. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, let me compute the exponent as (ΔE)/(k T_spot) - (ΔE)/(k T_no_spot) )

= (ΔE)/(k) [ 1/T_spot - 1/T_no_spot ]

Which is the same as (hc/(lambda k)) [ 1/T_spot - 1/T_no_spot ]

So, let's compute this.

We have T_spot =5500 K, T_no_spot=6000 K.

So,

exponent = (hc/(lambda k)) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ]

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4.

So, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33e6) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 )= approx 1.515e-5.

So, the exponent is (hc/(lambda k)) * 1.515e-5.

Wait, but what is hc/(lambda k)?

Earlier, we found that for T=6000 K, hc/(lambda k T) ≈16.59.

But hc/(lambda k) is 16.59 * T.

Wait, no, hc/(lambda k) = (hc/(lambda k T)) * T.

So, hc/(lambda k) = (16.59) *6000 K. That's going to be a huge number. But that can't be right, so perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exponent as (hc/(lambda k)) (1/T_spot -1/T_no_spot).

But hc/(lambda k) = (hc/(lambda k T)) * T.

So for T=6000 K, hc/(lambda k T)=16.59 → hc/(lambda k) = 16.59 *6000 = 99540 K.

So the exponent becomes 99540 * [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] = 99540*(1.515e-5) ≈ 99540 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.508.

So, the exponent is about 1.508.

Thus, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = exp(1.508) ≈ 4.5.

Ah, that's matching option C.

Wait, so I think I messed up the initial approach, but now it's clear.

So the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is higher, because higher T makes the exponential term larger, so n2 is more populated, making n1/n2 smaller. So when the star has spots (T lower), n1/n2 increases.

But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. That contradicts, so perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1). Because when T is higher, n2/n1 is higher, but when T is lower, the ratio decreases.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp(1.508) ≈4.5.

Which is option C. So the answer should be C) ~4.5.


Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$) is 6000 K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. The problem involves the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), which decreases when the star has spots. The goal is to determine the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of $\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}$, so the energy difference is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.

The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into this expression, the ratio becomes:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\Delta E / (kT)$
The energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$, $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$, and $\lambda = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}$. Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The term $\Delta E / (kT)$ is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})T}.
\]

For $T = 6000 \, \text{K}$:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(6000)} \approx 16.56.
\]

For $T = 5500 \, \text{K}$:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})(5500)} \approx 18.08.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(16.56 - 18.08\right) = \exp(-1.52).
\]

The ratio $\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}} / \left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}$ is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.52) \approx 4.57.
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately $4.5$, which matches option C.

ANSWER: C
