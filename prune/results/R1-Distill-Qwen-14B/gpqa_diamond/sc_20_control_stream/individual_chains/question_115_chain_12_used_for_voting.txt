Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But the specifics here are a bit tricky.

So, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors relate to their speeds. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to know their exact velocities, just their energies or momenta.

Since they annihilate, their total energy and momentum must be conserved. Let me consider the frame where the collision happens. The electron and positron are moving towards each other, so I think I should calculate their total momentum and energy before the collision.

Electron and positron have the same mass, but opposite charges. But since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be opposite? Wait, but the problem says the electron is moving left to right, and the positron is moving right to left? Or wait, no, the positron is moving from the right, so maybe same direction as the electron? Wait, no, the problem says: "electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left" and the positron is "from the right" along the same axis. So the electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from left along horizontal), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's from the right, moving along horizontal to the left). So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says: the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal — so direction is to the right. Positron is moving from the right along the horizontal — so direction is to the left. So they're moving toward each other along the same line.

So in the lab frame, their momenta are opposite. So when they collide, their total momentum will determine the frame in which they annihilate.

But when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Photons carry momentum, and since the problem states that both photons have the same energy, that might help. The photons are moving in opposite vertical directions relative to some axis? Wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both photons are moving to the right, but one up and the other down. Hmm, that's interesting because that might complicate the momentum calculations.

Wait, but if both photons are moving to the right, their momenta would be in the same direction. But wait, in that case, their horizontal components would add. But wait, the initial system (electron and positron) had some total momentum. Let's model this.

First, find the total energy and momentum before annihilation.

The electron has Lorentz factor gamma_e =4. Its rest mass is m_e. So its total energy is gamma_e * m_e c². Similarly, the positron has gamma_p =2, so energy is gamma_p * m_e c².

But wait, wait. The electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momentum vectors are opposite. So the total momentum is the sum of their individual momenta.

The momentum of a particle is p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma = (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2), and v = (pc²)/(gamma m c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the relation p = gamma m v. But v for each can be found in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, another way: since p = gamma m v, and for each particle, gamma = 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

Wait, but velocity and direction is important. Let's take the positive direction as the electron's direction (to the right). So the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative.

Hmm, but maybe using the fact that p = gamma * m * v.

Wait, let's compute the magnitudes. For the electron:

gamma_e =4, so p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e.

Similarly, for the positron, which is moving opposite: gamma_p =2, so p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p. But since it's moving opposite, its velocity is negative. So the total momentum P_total is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative, because it's moving left). Wait no, if the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is negative.

Wait, let's compute each particle's momentum.

First, let's find the velocities. For each particle, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So for the electron, gamma_e =4. So 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²).

Squaring both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e²/c²) → 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/16 → v_e²/c² = 15/16 → v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p =2. So 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²).

Squared: 4 = 1/(1 - v_p^2/c^2) → 1 - v_p^2/c^2 = 1/4 → v_p^2/c^2 = 3/4 → v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866 c.

But wait, which direction is each moving? The electron is moving to the right (from left), so v_e is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so v_p is negative, so v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.

Now, their momenta:

p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e =4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So the total momentum P_total is p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So the total momentum is in the positive direction (since sqrt(15) > sqrt(3)).

Next, energy. The total energy is the sum of the energies of electron and positron.

Each has energy E = gamma m c².

So E_e =4 m_e c², E_p = 2 m_e c².

Total energy E_total = (4 +2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

After annihilation, the two photons must carry off the total energy and momentum.

Each photon has energy E_photon. The problem states that the two photons have the same energy, E_photon.

So E_photon = E_total / 2 = 3 m_e c².

Wait, but wait. What about the momentum? The sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the total momentum, which is P_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Each photon has energy E_photon =3 m_e c². The momentum of a photon is p_photon = E_photon / c.

So each photon's momentum is (3 m_e c²) / c =3 m_e c.

So each photon has momentum 3 m_e c.

Now, the photons are moving in directions described as upper-right and lower-right. So their directions are symmetrically placed above and below the horizontal axis, making the same angle with the horizontal. Let's say the angle with respect to the horizontal is theta. So one photon is at +theta (upper right), and the other at -theta (lower right). Since they're moving in opposite vertical directions but same horizontal direction.

Wait, but wait. Because both are moving to the right, their momenta have positive x-components. So their momenta vectors are in the same general direction but with some vertical component. But the total momentum must be along the horizontal, as the initial system had a horizontal momentum.

Wait, the initial total momentum is along the horizontal (the x-axis), so the sum of the two photons' momenta must also be along the x-axis.

Each photon has momentum p_photon =3 m_e c. Let me represent them as vectors.

Let's model each photon's momentum as a vector. Let the first photon have an angle theta above the x-axis, and the second have theta below the x-axis.

So the momentum vectors are:

Photon 1: p1 = (3 m_e c) * (cos(theta), sin(theta)) )

Photon 2: p2 = (3 m_e c) * (cos(theta), -sin(theta)) )

The sum of these vectors is p1 + p2 = ( 6 m_e c cos(theta), 0 )

But the sum must equal the total initial momentum, which is (m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0 )

So equate the x-components:

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify: 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.

Let me compute that.

Wait, compute sqrt(15) ≈3.872, sqrt(3)≈1.732.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈3.872 -1.732 ≈2.14.

Divide by 6: 2.14 /6 ≈0.3567.

So cos(theta) ≈0.3567. Theta ≈acos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but wait. Each photon is making an angle theta with the horizontal. So the angle between them would be 2 theta. Because one is at theta above, the other at theta below. So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.

So 2 *69 ≈138 degrees. Hmm, that's one of the options, option C.

But let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's compute the exact value of cos(theta):

sqrt(15) = approx 3.872983, sqrt(3)=1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = approx 2.14093.

Divided by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So theta = arccos(0.35682).

Calculating that, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees. So 2 theta≈138 degrees.

Which would be the angle between the two photons. So the answer would be option C) 138.

Wait, but wait another thing. I assumed that both photons have the same magnitude of momentum. Each has p=3 m_e c. Is that correct?

Yes, because each photon's energy is 3 m_e c², and since p_photon = E_photon / c, each has p=3 m_e c.

So the sum of their x-components must equal the initial total momentum, which we found to be m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So 6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Cancel m_e c from each side: 6 cos(theta)= sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

That's correct.

So theta is ~69 degrees, and the angle between the two photons is 2*69=138 degrees.

So the correct answer is C)138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, followed by the production of two photons. The key principles are conservation of energy and momentum.

### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum
- The electron has a Lorentz factor of \( \gamma_e = 4 \), and the positron has \( \gamma_p = 2 \). Their rest mass is \( m_e \), and the speed of light is \( c \).
- The total energy before annihilation is:
  \[
  E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
  \]
- The total momentum is calculated using the relativistic momentum formula \( p = \gamma m v \). The electron moves to the right with velocity \( v_e = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \), and the positron moves to the left with velocity \( v_p = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \). Thus:
  \[
  p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c = m_e c \sqrt{15},
  \]
  \[
  p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c\right) = -m_e c \sqrt{3}.
  \]
  The total momentum is:
  \[
  P_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
  \]

### Step 2: Photon Properties After Annihilation
- After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \( E_{\text{photon}} \). Since energy is conserved:
  \[
  E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = \frac{6 m_e c^2}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.
  \]
- The momentum of each photon is:
  \[
  p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
  \]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
- The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, symmetrically placed relative to the horizontal axis. Let the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis be \( \theta \). The momentum vectors of the photons are:
  \[
  \vec{p}_1 = (3 m_e c \cos\theta, 3 m_e c \sin\theta), \quad \vec{p}_2 = (3 m_e c \cos\theta, -3 m_e c \sin\theta).
  \]
  The total momentum is:
  \[
  \vec{P}_{\text{total}} = \vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2 = (6 m_e c \cos\theta, 0).
  \]
- Equating the total momentum to the initial momentum:
  \[
  6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
  \]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
- Compute \( \cos\theta \):
  \[
  \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.140.
  \]
  \[
  \cos\theta = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567.
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \theta = \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
  \]
- The angle between the two photons is \( 2\theta \):
  \[
  2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
  \]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
