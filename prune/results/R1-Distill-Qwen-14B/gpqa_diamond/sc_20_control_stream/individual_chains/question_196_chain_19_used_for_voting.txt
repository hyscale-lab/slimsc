Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed of a particle in such a system.

Wait, what do I remember about harmonic oscillators? So, in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has a potential energy proportional to x squared. The force is F = -kx, according to Hooke's law. The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Oh, right! The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy is the same. So the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's in the classical, non-relativistic case. This problem is about a relativistic oscillator, though.

Right, in relativity, things change because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Oh wait, but the question is about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. So I need to take into account relativistic effects.

So, the particle's motion is subject to special relativity. The potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but how does the system behave in this case? The oscillator's restoring force is F = -kx, but the dynamics are relativistic. So energy conservation would involve both the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy.

Let me think about energy conservation. At maximum amplitude A, the particle comes to rest momentarily, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. In the relativistic case, the situation might be different because the kinetic energy depends on velocity in a non-linear way.

Wait, no, the maximum speed occurs when the particle is passing through the equilibrium point. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc² (is that right? Or is the rest energy separate? Hmm.)

Wait, no. Let's think again. The total mechanical energy in the non-relativistic case is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

So at maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right because the total energy should include the rest mass energy. Oh wait, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but when x is maximum, the system's total energy is E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is the potential energy part of the total mechanical energy, which is E = mc² + (1/2)kA²?

Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is a combination of rest mass energy and potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's structure this properly.

In the relativistic case, total energy E is given by E = gamma * mc². So when the particle is at x = A, its velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Because when x is A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA²? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy, which is E = (1/2)kA²? No, that doesn't make sense because in non-relativistic, E is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of KE and PE. But in the relativistic case, you can't ignore the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is mc² plus the non-relativistic potential energy. Because in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and when the particle is at x=0, all of that is converted into kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy comes from the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

Hmm, perhaps let's consider this: At x = A, the particle's velocity is zero, so its kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy is just (1/2)kA², but that can't be right because the rest mass energy is mc². So wait, maybe I should think that the system's total energy is mc² plus (1/2)kA². Because when the particle is at rest (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is mc². When it's at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but that seems a bit off because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy would be (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at x=A, but the rest mass energy is mc², which is way larger. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is considered in the frame of the oscillator, and the total energy is (1/2)kA², but that seems to ignore the rest mass energy. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to approach it using the principle of energy conservation.

The system's total energy E must be conserved. At any point, E = kinetic energy + potential energy.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So, E = (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

At maximum amplitude x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, because v=0. Thus, E = (1-1)mc² + (1/2)k A² = (1/2)k A².

But wait, that would imply that the total energy is just (1/2)k A², but that seems to neglect the rest mass energy. That can't be right because the particle's rest mass energy is mc², which is much larger than (1/2)k A² unless k is very large or A is very large.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the potential energy is part of the total energy, but the rest mass energy is separate. So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). So, E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but then when the particle is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy would be (gamma - 1) mc² + 0. But according to energy conservation, this should equal E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, let's write that equation:

At x=0 (maximum speed), potential energy is zero, so:

E = (gamma - 1) mc² + 0 = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, substituting, (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc²? That can't be right because then the left side would be (gamma -1) mc² and the right would be (1/2)k A² + mc². Wait, that would lead to (gamma -1) = (1/2 k A²)/(mc²) + 1, meaning gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1? Wait, no, maybe I messed up the equation.

Wait, let me think again. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and mechanical energy (which in non-relativistic is (1/2)kA²). So, E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At x = 0, the potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

mc² + (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, that can't be. Because if I move mc² from the right, I get (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc². Then gamma -1 = (1/2 k A²)/(mc²) + 1. That would give gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1. Hmm, but that would make gamma larger than 1, which is possible, but let's see.

Wait, but if I rearrange it correctly:

At x=0, E = (gamma -1) mc² + 0 = (gamma -1) mc².

But the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So,

(gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, that's not correct because then (gamma-1) would be 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), which would make gamma = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But that can't be right because when the particle is at x=0, the kinetic energy is in addition to the rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the total energy being the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. So,

E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But when the particle is at x=0, its mechanical energy is all kinetic, so:

E = mc² + (1/2)k A² = (gamma) mc².

Because the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so total mechanical energy is (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, no. Wait, the total energy E is mc² plus the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). So, E = mc² + (kinetic + potential).

At x=0, potential is zero, so E = mc² + kinetic.

But kinetic is (gamma -1) mc², so E = mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term for simplicity. Let me let (k A²)/(2 m c²) = α. So,

gamma = 1 + α.

Now,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + α.

I need to solve for v.

Let me square both sides:

gamma² = (1 + α)² = 1 + 2α + α².

But gamma² is 1/(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + 2α + α².

Let me take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + 2α + α²).

But in terms of solving for v, perhaps it's better to express v in terms of gamma.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express v in terms of gamma.

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, from gamma = 1 + α,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + α)^2).

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this expression.

Let me compute 1/(1 + α)^2.

1/(1 + α)^2 = 1/(1 + 2α + α²).

So,

1 - 1/(1 + 2α + α²) = [ (1 + 2α + α²) - 1 ] / (1 + 2α + α²) ) 

= (2α + α²) / (1 + 2α + α²)

= α (2 + α) / (1 + α)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [α (2 + α) ] / (1 + α)^2 )

= c * sqrt( α (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha).

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which I can write as (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = (k A^2)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me substitute alpha back in:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 ] )

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me see if any of the options match this expression.

Looking at the options, option A and B have square roots, and involve terms with kA²/(2m) or similar.

Wait, looking at option D:

D) v_max = c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2 ]

Wait, that looks similar to the expression I have for v.

Wait, let's see. If I have v = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 ), where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c²))) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Let me factor out (k A^2/(2 m c²)) from the numerator:

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c²)) [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

Hmm, let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (k A^2/(2 m c²)) [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) ]

Denominator: [ 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) ]^2

Let me factor the numerator:

= (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ]

But 2 is 4/(2), so:

= (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) [ (4 + k A^2/( m c^2 )) / 2 ]

Hmm, not sure that's helping.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write everything in terms of (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as alpha.

So, alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then,

v = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

But 2 + alpha is (alpha +2), and denominator is (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the square root:

[ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

= [ (alpha (alpha + 2) ) ] / ( (alpha + 1)^2 )

Hmm, perhaps factor it into something that looks like 1 - (something).

Alternatively, let me think about it as:

[ alpha (alpha + 2) ] = alpha^2 + 2 alpha = (alpha +1)^2 -1.

Because (alpha +1)^2 is alpha^2 + 2 alpha +1. So,

alpha^2 + 2 alpha = (alpha+1)^2 -1.

So,

[ alpha (alpha +2) ] = (alpha+1)^2 -1.

So, [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1+alpha)^2 = [ (1+alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1+alpha)^2 = 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 )

Which is,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Looking at the options, that's option D.

Option D says:

v_max= c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, no, the option is written as (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 in the denominator. Wait, the expression in option D is:

D) v_max = c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2 ]

Which matches what we have.

So the maximum speed is given by option D.

But wait, let me double-check.

Another approach: In the non-relativistic limit, when (k A²)/(2 m c²) is very small, say alpha << 1, then option D becomes:

v ≈ c sqrt(1 - [1 - 2 alpha ] ) = c sqrt( 2 alpha )

Because 1/(1 + alpha) ≈ 1 - alpha when alpha is small.

So,

1/(1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha.

Then,

1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 2 alpha.

So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 2 alpha ) = c sqrt( 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) = c sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2) ) ) = c * (A sqrt(k/(m c^2)) )

Wait, but the non-relativistic maximum speed is sqrt(k A²/m), so in the non-relativistic limit, when alpha is small, let's compare:

In option D,

v ≈ c sqrt( 2 * (k A²/(2 m c^2)) ) = c sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) ) = sqrt( (k A^2 c^2)/(m c^2) ) ) = sqrt( k A² / m )

Which is correct for the non-relativistic case. So that suggests that option D is correct.

Alternatively, looking at option B:

Option B is v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, that seems to have a different form.

Another check: when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) approaches zero, option D gives v_max ≈ sqrt(k A^2/m), which is correct non-relativistic.

What about when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) approaches 1? Let's say alpha =1.

Then,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2 ) = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/4 ) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 0.866c.

Which makes sense, as the speed approaches a significant fraction of c.

In option D, when alpha is very large, let's say alpha approaches infinity, then 1 + alpha ≈ alpha, so 1/(1 + alpha)^2 approaches zero, so 1 - 0 =1, so v approaches c, which makes sense because you can't go faster than light.

So option D seems to fit all checks.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). The potential energy is given by \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) at maximum amplitude \( x = A \), where the velocity is zero. At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is entirely kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Using energy conservation, the total energy at \( x = A \) is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At \( x = 0 \), the total energy is entirely kinetic:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \alpha
\]

The Lorentz factor is also related to velocity by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \alpha \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
\]

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the form of option D. To verify, consider the non-relativistic limit (\( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \)):

\[
v_{\text{max}} \approx c \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}}
\]

This recovers the classical result for maximum speed, confirming the correctness of the relativistic expression. Additionally, when \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \to \infty \), \( v_{\text{max}} \to c \), consistent with the relativistic speed limit.

Thus, the correct answer is:
