Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r², right? And the question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Wait, wait. Let me think. In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), but wait, isn't that for each degree of freedom? Or maybe I should think in terms of the principal quantum number n?

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up the 1D and 3D cases. In 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So the energy is E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. Or wait, no—wait, no, in 3D, each direction (x, y, z) has its own quantum number (n_x, n_y, n_z), so the total energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Alternatively, sometimes they parameterize it as n_total = n_x + n_y + n_z, and E = ħ ω (n_total + 3/2). 

So wait, the ground state is n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Then n_total = 0, E = (3/2) ħ ω. The first excited state would be when n_total = 1. So the states are degenerate for each n_total. The degeneracy is given by the number of combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that sum to a particular value.

So the third excited state—wait, what's the order here? The ground state is n_total = 0 (E=(3/2)ħω), first excited is n_total=1 (E=(5/2)ħω), second is n_total=2 (E=(7/2)ħω), third is n_total=3 (E=(9/2)ħω). Because each time you add 1 to n_total, the energy increases by ħω. So the third excited state is n_total=3. 

Wait, no, wait. Because the ground state is the lowest, so first excited is the next higher, which is n_total=1, second is n_total=2, third is n_total=3. So the third excited state would have n_total=3.

Now, the energy for that would be (3/2 + 3) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the question.

Next, how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for that energy? That is, the degeneracy, the number of distinct states with E = (9/2) ħω. Which is the number of ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. 

So the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.

Hmm, that's a combinatorics problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (n + k -1 choose k-1), where n is the total and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3. So (3 +3-1 choose 3-1)= (5 choose 2) = 10. So 10 eigenfunctions.

So the energy is (9/2) ħ ω and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħ ω and 10. Option C has 3, which doesn't fit.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the energy. The ground state is n=0, energy (3/2) ħω. Then each excited state adds an ħω. So the first excited (n=1) is (5/2), second (n=2) is (7/2), third (n=3) is (9/2). Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.

In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \), and the energy levels are quantized as \( E = \hbar \omega (n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}) \), where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions. The total quantum number is \( n_{\text{total}} = n_x + n_y + n_z \), and the energy can also be expressed as \( E = \hbar \omega (n_{\text{total}} + \frac{3}{2}) \).

The ground state corresponds to \( n_{\text{total}} = 0 \) with energy \( E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \). Each successive excited state increases \( n_{\text{total}} \) by 1, and the energy increases by \( \hbar \omega \). Therefore:
- Ground state: \( n_{\text{total}} = 0 \), \( E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \),
- First excited state: \( n_{\text{total}} = 1 \), \( E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \),
- Second excited state: \( n_{\text{total}} = 2 \), \( E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \),
- Third excited state: \( n_{\text{total}} = 3 \), \( E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

For the third excited state (\( n_{\text{total}} = 3 \)), the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponds to the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by \( \binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \), where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \). Thus, the degeneracy is \( \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10 \).

From the options provided:
- Option A correctly states the energy as \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and the degeneracy as 10.
- Option C incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3.
- Options B and D involve incorrect expressions for the energy.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
