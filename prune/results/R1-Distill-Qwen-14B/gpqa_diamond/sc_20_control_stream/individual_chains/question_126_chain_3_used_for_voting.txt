Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about reactions involving LAH and NaBH4, and then looking at the products using HPLC. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step.

First, the question says that two reactions are performed. Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4, also followed by acidic workup. After both reactions, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks each chromatogram shows.

Alright, so I need to figure out what the products of each reaction are first.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. I remember that LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the structure of the starting material is a ketone at position 3 of a six-carbon chain, with a methoxy group at position 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out mentally. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. But the 5th carbon has a methoxy. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3. So, 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-? Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO-(CH2)3CH3. But wait, 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is the fourth carbon from the ketone. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

The molecule is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? No. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, no. Hexane has six carbons, so hexan-3-one would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3

But in the given compound, it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, on carbon 5, which is the CH2 next to the ketone, that's where the methoxy is attached. So, structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH3? No, wait. Let me count again. Wait, hexan-3-one: positions 1 to 6.

- Position 3 is the ketone: O=C-R.
- So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methoxy on position 5.

Wait, position 5 is the second carbon from the end. So, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3 attached to which carbon? Wait, position 5 is the fifth carbon. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? No, wait, let's imagine the structure as:

(CH2)2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that's seven carbons. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. Let me write it as:

Carbon 1: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, perhaps not. Let me think systematically.

Hexan-3-one: positions 1 to 6, with C=O at position 3.

So, structure is:

1: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3

But with a methoxy at position 5, which is the fourth carbon from the end. So, position 5 is the second CH2 group after the ketone. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be seven carbons. Wait, wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (CO), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH(OCH3)). No, wait, perhaps position 5 is CH(OCH3), making the structure:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So, when LAH is used, the ketone at position 3 is reduced to an alcohol. LAH would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol, so the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at the methoxy group. Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone, does the configuration change?

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The methoxy is on carbon 5, which is a stereocenter. So, that's an S configuration. When we reduce the ketone (carbon 3) to an alcohol, the product will have an additional stereocenter at carbon 3.

Wait, but wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols without any specific stereochemistry unless the starting material is a prochiral ketone. Wait, the starting material is a ketone, so it's prochiral. So, when reduced, will it form a chiral center with R or S configuration? Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a stereocenter at C5. The ketone is at C3. Upon reduction, C3 becomes an OH group, making it a stereocenter. So, the product would be 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy group at C5. But what about the configuration at C3?

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but when it reduces a ketone, the product's configuration depends on the starting material's structure. Wait, no, wait, the ketone is not a stereocenter, so when reduced, the alcohol will have two possible configurations, but since the starting material is a prochiral ketone, the product will become a chiral center with a specific configuration. But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. Does that influence the configuration at C3 upon reduction?

Wait, I think that the reduction of a ketone (which is planar) would lead to the formation of a new chiral center with a specific configuration. But in this case, the starting material is (S)-configured at C5, but what does that have to do with the configuration at C3 after reduction? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the configuration at C3 will be determined by the hydride attack. Wait, LAH would approach from the less hindered side. Alternatively, since the starting material is (S) at C5, maybe the structure around C3 is such that the hydride attack occurs from a particular side, determining the configuration at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the ketone doesn't involve any influence from the existing stereocenter. Wait, but the ketone is at C3, which is a different position from C5. So, perhaps the configuration at C3 is determined by the structure, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, maybe the product will be a racemic mixture? No, wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and in this case, the ketone is in a chiral environment due to the S configuration at C5.

Wait, maybe the product will be a single enantiomer because the reaction is stereoselective. Or perhaps the configuration is determined by other factors.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product structure. After reduction, the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group at C5. So, the structure would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, the configuration at C5 is (S), but C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, but what about the configuration at C3? Since the starting ketone isn't chiral, the product could form as a racemic mixture at C3. But wait, wait, no, because the starting material is chiral at C5, maybe the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction isn't stereoselective, leading to a racemic mixture at C3. But wait, in the presence of a chiral center elsewhere, maybe the reaction is stereoselective.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed and see what the product is, and whether it's a single enantiomer or a mixture.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol with two stereocenters: C3 and C5. But wait, wait: the starting material has a stereocenter at C5 (S configuration) and the ketone at C3. After reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So, the product is 3-R or 3-S, depending on how the reduction occurs.

Wait, perhaps the configuration at C3 is determined by the structure of the starting material. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me imagine the structure:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Positions:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: C=O (ketone)

4: CH2

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH3

Wait, no. Wait, 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. So, carbon 5 is CH(OCH3), with the neighboring carbons being 4 and 6.

So, for (S) configuration at C5, looking at the priorities: the substituents are OCH3 (highest priority), CH2CO (from C4?), CH2CH3 (from C6?), and the CH2 from C4? Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that the starting material is a single enantiomer, which after reduction, creates another stereocenter.

But perhaps the key point is that the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, or maybe a single enantiomer, but I'm not sure yet.

Moving on to Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH. So, it's:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So, 2 and 4 positions are carbonyls.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Let me count: 1 (O=C-), 2 (CH2), 3 (C(O)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). Wait, no, that can't be right because 2 and 4 would be on a five-carbon chain.

Ah, no, wait: 2 and 4 would mean the positions are 2 and 4 in a five-carbon chain. So, positions 2 and 4 have ketone groups. So, structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, but that would make it pentane-2,4-dione. So, when treated with NaBH4, which is a reducing agent, but it's a ketone, so it will be reduced. But wait, NaBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. However, since there are two ketone groups, each will be reduced.

But wait, in this case, the molecule is symmetric. So, when NaBH4 is in excess, both ketones will be reduced. So, each C=O becomes a CHOH group. So, the product would be 2,4-pentanediol: HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3?

No, wait, perhaps it's (CH3)C(O)CH2COCH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be 5 carbons if it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. But that's five carbons, yes: positions 1 (CH3), 2 (C=O), 3 (CH2), 4 (C=O), 5 (CH3). So, each ketone is on C2 and C4.

So, when treated with NaBH4, each ketone is reduced. So, each -C(O)- becomes -CH(OH)-. But wait, since the molecule is symmetric, the product would be 2,4-pentanediol: HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting material is:

O
||
CH3-C-CH2-C-CH3
   |   |
   O   O

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be six carbons. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as pentane-2,4-dione: 

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, it's a five-carbon chain with ketones at positions 2 and 4.

So, when NaBH4 is added, each ketone is reduced. So, each C=O becomes a CH(OH) group. So, the product is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. So, 2,4-pentanediol. Now, each of the two secondary alcohols is a stereocenter. But wait, each of these positions (C2 and C4) is a stereocenter because the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol creates a new chiral center.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a symmetrical diketone. So, when each ketone is reduced, each can form two possible stereoisomers. However, since the molecule is symmetrical (the two ketones are in symmetric positions), the product will be a single diastereomer or a mixture?

Wait, when you reduce a symmetrical diketone with a chiral reducing agent, you can get a racemic mixture if each center forms both enantiomers. But NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent, but wait, no, NaBH4 is not chiral. It's a non-chiral reducing agent. So, the reduction may lead to a racemic mixture at each center.

Wait, but if both ketones are reduced, and each reduction leads to a racemic mixture, then the overall product would have multiple stereoisomers. However, due to the symmetry, perhaps not all possible combinations are present.

Wait, let's think about the product structure. Each reduction of a ketone (C2 and C4) would create a new chiral center. So, each has two possibilities. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the two stereocenters are identical in terms of their environment. So, the possible stereoisomers are:

1) Both alcohols are R configuration.

2) Both are S configuration.

3) One R and one S.

Wait, but wait, in a symmetrical molecule like this, would the stereoisomers be identical if the configurations are (R,R) and (S,S), or would they be different? Let me think. For a molecule with two stereocenters, if the molecule is symmetrical, such as meso compounds, some stereoisomers may be identical.

In this case, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. The molecule would have two stereocenters at C2 and C4. Now, if the configurations are R and S at each, but because the molecule is symmetrical, certain stereoisomers might be the same. 

Wait, if both C2 and C4 are R configuration, would the molecule be the same as if both are S? Because the molecule is symmetrical along the central CH2 group. So, (R,R) and (S,S) would be enantiomers of each other, but each would be a distinct stereoisomer. Alternatively, if one is R and the other S, would that lead to a meso form?

Wait, no, because in a meso compound, the stereocenters are mirror images of each other, making the molecule achiral. In this case, 2,4-pentanediol would have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. So, if C2 is R and C4 is S, the molecule would be a meso compound, making it achiral. So, the possible stereoisomers are:

- (R,R) and (S,S): these are enantiomers, each being a pair.

- (R,S) which is the meso form, and thus a single compound.

So, from the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4 in excess, I think the product would be a mixture of three possible stereoisomers: two enantiomeric pairs (R,R and S,S) and the meso form (R,S). But wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent but not a chiral one, so it would produce both possible configurations at each center.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is a symmetrical diketone. So, when each ketone is reduced, each would form a secondary alcohol, but since the molecule is symmetrical, the product would have both stereocenters in the same configuration or opposite.

But perhaps, in this case, the product after NaBH4 reduction would be the meso compound and the two enantiomers. Wait, but how many products in total?

Wait, when you reduce a symmetrical diketone, the possible stereoisomers are as follows:

- Both stereocenters R and R: which would be a single enantiomer.

- Both S and S: the other enantiomer.

- R and S: which, due to symmetry, would be a meso compound.

So, that's three possible products. But wait, when NaBH4 is used, which is a non-chiral reducing agent, the product would form a racemic mixture for each stereocenter. But considering the symmetry, would that lead to three products?

Alternatively, maybe the product is a single meso compound because the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no, because NaBH4 would lead to both possible configurations.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let's imagine that each ketone reduction produces both R and S configurations. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the combination of R and S at each center would lead to a meso form, while the same configuration (R,R or S,S) would be their own stereoisomers.

So, the products after Reaction II would be three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (meso R,S). But wait, would they form all three? Or would it form all possible combinations?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces all possible stereoisomers, but in the case of a symmetrical starting material, the products would be a racemic mixture for each possible configuration, but considering the symmetry, some would be identical.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a 50:50 mixture of (R,R) and (S,S), and a 100% of the meso compound. No, that doesn't make sense because each reduction would give a racemic mixture, but the overall product would have all possible stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each stereocenter is formed in a racemic mixture, leading to the products (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), and (S,S). But due to the symmetry, (R,S) and (S,R) are the same (meso), so only three distinct stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and the meso.

So, the product would be a mixture of three stereoisomers.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the outcome of the reduction. When we have a symmetrical diketone and reduce it with a non-chiral reducing agent, each ketone is reduced independently, but the molecule's symmetry would cause some stereoisomers to be identical.

So, if each ketone is reduced to give both R and S configurations, the possible stereoisomers would be (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), (S,S). But because the molecule is symmetrical, (R,S) and (S,R) are the same, so they're a single meso compound. So, the products are (R,R), (S,S), and the meso form.

But wait, when NaBH4 is used in excess, it would fully reduce both ketones, but each reduction step is independent. So, each ketone would form a racemic mixture. But considering the molecule's symmetry, the overall product would have three stereoisomers.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible products and their number. Let's proceed.

Now, bringing it all together. After both reactions, the products are combined. So, Reaction I's product is (probably) a compound with two stereocenters (if the reduction led to a new stereocenter), and Reaction II's product is a mixture of three stereoisomers: two are enantiomers of each other, and one is a meso compound.

Wait, but let me recap. Reaction I: starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5. After reduction with LAH, the ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, introducing a new chiral center at C3. So, the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group at C5. But wait, the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Wait, but what's the configuration at C3? Since the starting material is (S) at C5, would that influence the configuration at C3? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, maybe the product has a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, maybe the product is a single enantiomer, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer, with two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

But regardless, let's proceed. So, the product from Reaction I is a molecule with two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer with possible multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, but wait, the starting material has a single stereocenter. Upon reduction, it gains another stereocenter. So, the product would have two stereocenters, meaning it can exist as multiple stereoisomers.

But let's think about the outcome of Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group at C5.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3?

Wait, no, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's:

(CH2)2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

No, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. Hexan-3-one has 6 carbons, with the ketone at position 3. So, positions are:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: C=O

4: CH2

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH3.

Wait, no. If it's 5-methoxy, then position 5 has the methoxy. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3.

No, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would be 6 carbons: positions 1 to 6.

So, after reduction, the ketone (position 3) becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy at position 5.

Thus, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but this would have a new stereocenter at C3. So, the molecule now has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

The configuration at C3 would depend on the approach of the hydride. Since the starting material is (S)-configured at C5, perhaps the hydride attacks from a specific face, leading to a particular configuration at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer with specific configurations at both C3 and C5. Let's say the product is (R) at C3 and (S) at C5. So, the product has two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer with possible multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, but the question says that Reaction I is 100% complete, so the product is a single compound. So, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, with both C3 and C5 being stereocenters. Therefore, it's a diastereomer with two stereocenters.

But I'm not fully confident about this. Let's proceed.

Now, the products from both reactions are combined. So, Reaction I gives one product (maybe a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers), and Reaction II gives three stereoisomers (two enantiomers and a meso compound). Wait, but earlier I thought Reaction II gives three stereoisomers, but perhaps the product is a mixture of (R,R), (S,S), and the meso form.

Wait, but wait, pentane-2,4-dione when treated with excess NaBH4 would yield 2,4-pentanediol. Each ketone is reduced to an alcohol, creating stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material is symmetrical, the product would have two stereocenters, leading to possible stereoisomers.

But again, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible number of products from each reaction.

Reaction I: 1 product (since it's a single enantiomer, perhaps), but actually, it might have two chiral centers, leading to multiple stereoisomers. Or maybe not. Let me think: the starting material is (S) at C5, and upon reduction, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two chiral centers but is a single diastereomer. So, that would be one product.

Reaction II: The product is 2,4-pentanediol, which can exist as three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (meso R,S). But since the reaction is done in excess NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps all possible stereoisomers are formed. So, the product is a mixture of three stereoisomers.

Wait, but NaBH4 is a non-chiral reducing agent, so when each ketone is reduced, each would form a racemic mixture, leading to all possible combinations. But due to the symmetry, the (R,S) and (S,R) configurations are the same, making them a single meso compound.

So, the products from Reaction II are three: (R,R), (S,S), and the meso form.

Wait, but actually, when you have two chiral centers and the molecule is symmetrical, the number of stereoisomers is determined by whether it's a meso compound. In this case, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound when the configurations are opposite. So, the possible stereoisomers are (R,R), (S,S), and the meso form. So, three stereoisomers.

Now, combining the products from both reactions: Reaction I gives one product (a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers) and Reaction II gives three stereoisomers.

Wait, no, Reaction I may give a single stereoisomer, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I gives two stereoisomers, but I think it's more likely that it's a single product, given the starting material's configuration.

So, the combined products are: 1 (from I) + 3 (from II) = 4 products.

Now, when running these on HPLC columns, the number of peaks depends on whether the compounds are enantiomers or diastereomers.

First, normal-phase HPLC: this column doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, so enantiomers would co-elute. But diastereomers would elute at different times.

Chiral HPLC: this column can separate enantiomers as they have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase.

So, let's think about the combined products:

Product from Reaction I: Let's say it's a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers. So, two stereocenters → possible diastereomers if others have different configurations. But in this case, since it's a single product, it's just one compound.

Wait, but in reality, if the product has two chiral centers, it could be a single diastereomer, so only one peak in normal-phase (since it's a single compound) and one peak in chiral HPLC (since it's a single enantiomer, but if it's a single diastereomer, perhaps it's just one peak).

Wait, no. Wait, if the product is a single stereoisomer, meaning it's a single diastereomer, then in normal phase, it's a single peak. In chiral HPLC, it's a single peak as well because there's only one enantiomer present.

But wait, in the case of Reaction I, the product has two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer with others. But if the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, then in normal-phase HPLC, it would be a single peak. In chiral HPLC, since it's a single enantiomer, it would also be a single peak.

But wait, if the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, and is a single stereoisomer, then in normal-phase, it's one peak, and in chiral HPLC, it's one peak because it's a single enantiomer.

Now, the products from Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol, which has three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and the meso form.

In normal-phase HPLC, the meso form would elute as one peak, while (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers. Since normal-phase doesn't separate enantiomers, (R,R) and (S,S) would co-elute as one peak. So, in normal-phase, the products from Reaction II would give two peaks: one for the meso form, and one for the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers.

So, total peaks in normal-phase HPLC: 1 (Reaction I) + 2 (Reaction II) = 3 peaks.

In chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, each stereoisomer would elute as a separate peak. So, the three products from Reaction II would give three peaks: (R,R), (S,S), and the meso.

Wait, but the meso form is not chiral, so it would elute as a single peak in both normal and chiral HPLC.

Wait, yes. The meso compound is achiral, so in chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak (since it's not separated by the chiral column). The (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, so in chiral HPLC, they would elute as two separate peaks.

So, for Reaction II in chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (meso, R,R, S,S).

But wait, the meso form is not chiral, so in chiral HPLC, it would only show one peak, while each enantiomer of the other stereoisomers would show as separate peaks. So, Reaction II would contribute three peaks in chiral HPLC: (R,R) and (S,S) as separate peaks, and the meso as a single peak.

Wait, no. The meso form is a single compound, so it's one peak. The (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, so they would be two peaks in chiral HPLC.

So, Reaction II in chiral HPLC would give 1 (meso) + 2 (R,R and S,S) = 3 peaks.

Reaction I's product is a single compound, so in chiral HPLC, it would be one peak.

So, total peaks in chiral HPLC: 1 (Reaction I) + 3 (Reaction II) = 4 peaks.

Wait, but wait a second. Reaction I's product has two chiral centers. So, it's a diastereomer with others, but as a single stereoisomer, so it's a single peak in both HPLC columns.

Reaction II's products are three stereoisomers: two enantiomers and a meso. So, in chiral HPLC, the meso is one peak, and the two enantiomers are two peaks. So, 3 peaks from Reaction II.

Plus Reaction I's product: 1. So, 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

In normal-phase HPLC, Reaction II's products (three stereoisomers) would have the meso as one peak, and the two enantiomers as one peak (since they co-elute). So, Reaction II contributes 2 peaks. Reaction I contributes 1. So, total 3 peaks in normal-phase.

Wait, but wait. Let me recap:

Reaction I: 1 product (single stereoisomer with two chiral centers) → 1 peak in both HPLC.

Reaction II: 3 stereoisomers → in normal-phase, meso is 1 peak, (R,R) and (S,S) are 1 peak → total 2 peaks.

So, in normal-phase, total peaks: 1 + 2 = 3.

In chiral HPLC: Reaction I → 1 peak, Reaction II → (R,R), (S,S), meso → 3 peaks. So, total 4 peaks.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal. But wait, in my calculation, normal-phase has 3 peaks, chiral has 4.

Hm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, if Reaction I's product is a single diastereomer (two stereocenters), then in normal-phase HPLC, it would be a single peak. In chiral HPLC, it's a single peak as well because it's a single enantiomer, or perhaps as a diastereomer, but the key is, in chiral HPLC, it's a single peak.

Reaction II's products: 3 stereoisomers. In normal-phase, the meso is 1 peak, the (R,R) and (S,S) are 1 peak. So total 2 peaks from Reaction II. So, in normal-phase, 1 (Reaction I) + 2 (Reaction II) = 3 peaks.

In chiral HPLC, Reaction I: 1 peak. Reaction II: 3 peaks (meso, R,R, S,S). So, 4 peaks.

Looking back at the options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, none of the options match my calculation of 4 and 3. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single compound and thus doesn't contribute to the number of peaks in the same way.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate Reaction I. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, which reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol. The product is (R)- or (S)-configured at C3, but due to the starting material's configuration at C5, perhaps the product has a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers. So, in normal-phase HPLC, it's a single peak. In chiral HPLC, it's also a single peak because it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, but if it's a diastereomer, perhaps it's just a single compound, so it's a single peak in both cases.

So, Reaction I contributes 1 peak in both HPLC methods.

Reaction II's products: three stereoisomers, which in normal-phase give 2 peaks (meso and the two enantiomers as one peak). In chiral HPLC, they give 3 peaks.

So, total peaks:

Chiral HPLC: 1 (I) + 3 (II) = 4.

Normal-phase: 1 (I) + 2 (II) = 3.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer would have 4 peaks in chiral and 3 in normal. But none of the options provided match this. The options are:

A) 5 and 4.

B)3 and 2.

C)4 and 2.

D)3 and 3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereoisomers from Reaction II.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a single diastereomer. Let me think again.

Pentane-2,4-dione treated with NaBH4 in excess: each ketone is reduced, but because the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, the meso form.

Wait, no. Because when you reduce each ketone, they can form either R or S configurations, but due to the molecule's symmetry, some stereoisomers would be identical.

Wait, perhaps the product is a meso compound only. But that doesn't make sense, because NaBH4 would provide both R and S configurations for each ketone reduction, leading to a mixture.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture of (R,R) and (S,S), plus the meso form. No, that's not possible because when each ketone is reduced, each has a 50:50 chance of R or S configuration. But considering the molecule's symmetry, the possible stereoisomers would include (R,R), (S,S), and the meso form.

But how many peaks would each contribute in the HPLC?

In normal-phase HPLC:

- The meso form is a single peak.

- The (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, so they co-elute as one peak.

So, Reaction II contributes 2 peaks in normal-phase.

In chiral HPLC:

- The meso form is a single peak.

- (R,R) and (S,S) are two peaks.

So, Reaction II contributes 3 peaks.

So, total peaks:

Reaction I: 1 peak in both HPLC.

Reaction II: 2 peaks (normal) and 3 peaks (chiral).

So, normal-phase: 1 + 2 = 3 peaks.

Chiral HPLC: 1 + 3 = 4 peaks.

But the options don't include this combination. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, but that would require a different approach, perhaps, if the reduction doesn't lead to a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer, whereas Reaction II's product is a single compound.

Wait, but Reaction II's product is definitely multiple stereoisomers because it's a symmetrical diketone reduced to a symmetrical diol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereoisomers in Reaction I.

Maybe Reaction I's product has only one stereocenter. Let me think again.

Reaction I: starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is reduced to an alcohol. So, the new OH is at C3, making it a stereocenter. So, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, C5 was already a stereocenter in the starting material. So, upon reduction, it gains another stereocenter at C3. So, the product has two stereocenters, leading to multiple stereoisomers.

But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at C3, making it a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but why would it? The starting material's configuration at C5 doesn't directly influence the configuration at C3 during reduction. Unless the reaction is stereoselective.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of the ketone at C3 leads to a specific configuration at C3 based on the structure. For example, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, influenced by the existing groups.

In the starting material, the (S) configuration at C5 would influence the approach of the hydride. Let me imagine the structure.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the groups around C5 are:

- OCH3 (highest priority),

- CH2CO (from C4),

- CH3 (from C6),

and the CH2 from C4.

Wait, perhaps the configuration is such that the hydride attacks from a specific face, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

But without knowing the exact structure and the approach, perhaps the product will have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers. So, Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer.

Thus, in normal-phase HPLC, it's a single peak. In chiral HPLC, it's a single peak because it's a single enantiomer.

Then, Reaction II's products contribute as discussed: 2 peaks in normal, 3 in chiral.

So, total peaks would be 3 in normal and 4 in chiral. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the products' structures are different, leading to different numbers of stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product has only one stereocenter. Let me think again.

No, because the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group at C5. So, it has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, but perhaps the configuration at C3 is the same as C5, making it a diastereomer, but not necessarily a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, meaning a single stereoisomer, so in Reaction I, only one product is formed.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, Reaction I contributes 1 peak.

Reaction II contributes 2 (normal) and 3 (chiral) peaks.

So, total peaks in normal: 3, chiral:4.

But options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with a specific configuration that makes it a single compound, so only one peak in both HPLCs.

Reaction II: in normal-phase, 2 peaks, chiral 3.

So, total peaks:

Chiral: 1+3=4.

Normal: 1+2=3.

But none of the options match.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I's product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product isn't a stereoisomer but a single compound without any new stereocenters. But that's impossible, because the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol introduces a stereocenter.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, but the product is a meso compound. But that doesn't make sense because the positions are not symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I isn't a stereoisomer but a single compound, but that's not possible because it has two chiral centers.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach from another angle.

Question: How many peaks in each HPLC?

Assume that Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer (two chiral centers). So, in normal-phase, it's one peak; in chiral, one peak.

Reaction II's product: three stereoisomers.

In normal-phase:

- Meso: 1 peak.

- (R,R) and (S,S): 1 peak.

So, Reaction II contributes 2 peaks.

Total normal-phase peaks: 1 + 2 =3.

In chiral:

- Meso:1.

- (R,R):1.

- (S,S):1.

So, Reaction II contributes 3.

Total chiral peaks:1 +3=4.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I'm wrong, and Reaction II's product is only two stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about Reaction II. Let me think again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → 2,4-pentanediol.

Each reduction introduces a stereocenter. The starting material is symmetrical, so possible stereoisomers are (R,R), (S,S), and meso.

But perhaps the reaction leads to only the meso form and one enantiomeric pair. Or perhaps it leads to a racemic mixture of (R,R) and (S,S), but no meso.

Wait, but that's not possible because the reduction of each ketone can lead to either R or S configuration, and due to the molecule's symmetry, the meso form is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't produce all three stereoisomers. Maybe it produces only (R,R) and (S,S) in equal amounts, making a racemic mixture, and the meso form isn't formed. But that doesn't make sense because the starting material is symmetrical, so the reduction should produce all possible stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, the meso form, but that's unlikely because NaBH4 would reduce each ketone independently, leading to a mixture.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that in Reaction II, the product is a single diastereomer: the meso form. But that would require the reaction to proceed in a way that produces only the meso product, which isn't the case with NaBH4.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture of (R,R) and (S,S), but no meso.

But that can't be right because the molecule's symmetry allows for the meso form.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a 1:1:1 mixture of (R,R), (S,S), and meso.

But this is getting too complicated. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 5,4.

B)3,2.

C)4,2.

D)3,3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereocenters for Reaction I.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I doesn't have any new stereocenters. Let me think: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Reduction of the ketone introduces a new stereocenter at C3. So, the product has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

But perhaps the configuration at C3 is the same as C5, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, but the product would have two stereocenters, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but perhaps due to the starting material being a single enantiomer, only two are formed. No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, so a single stereoisomer.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the number of peaks each product would contribute.

Assuming Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer with two stereocenters: 1 peak in both HPLC.

Reaction II's product is three stereoisomers: in normal-phase, 2 peaks; in chiral, 3 peaks.

So, total peaks:

Chiral: 1+3=4.

Normal: 1+2=3.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product isn't a stereoisomer, but that's impossible. So, perhaps I should think that Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer, and Reaction II's product has two stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a single diastereomer, the meso form, and nothing else. So, in that case:

Reaction II's product is a single compound (meso) → 1 peak in both HPLC.

So, Reaction I:1 peak in both.

Reaction II:1 peak in both.

Total peaks:

Chiral:1+1=2.

Normal:1+1=2.

But that's not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that would require the reduction to not be stereoselective. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so perhaps the product has a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, and Reaction II's product contributes two peaks.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II only gives two stereoisomers: (R,R) and (S,S), with the meso not being formed. But that's not correct because the molecule is symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction II gives only the meso and one enantiomer. But that's not possible.

I'm stuck. Perhaps looking for the correct answer based on the options, the correct answer is C) 4 and 2.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product isn't a stereoisomer. But that can't be. So, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single compound, and Reaction II's product contributes 2 peaks in normal-phase and 3 in chiral.

So, in normal-phase, total 3 peaks (1+2), and chiral 4.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is C) 4 and 2.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a single compound, which doesn't add any peaks beyond what Reaction II contributes.

Wait, no, it's combining both Reaction I and II's products.

Alternatively, maybe Reaction I's product is a meso compound, leading to a single peak in both HPLC. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are as follows:

Reaction I: a single compound with two stereocenters → 1 peak in both HPLC.

Reaction II: three stereoisomers → 2 peaks in normal-phase, 3 in chiral.

So, total peaks:

Chiral:1+3=4.

Normal:1+2=3.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but looking at the options, the closest would be C) 4 and 2, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, and Reaction II's products don't include the meso form, but only (R,R) and (S,S). But that's not correct because the molecule's symmetry allows for the meso form.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Based on the reasoning, the correct answer should be 4 peaks in chiral and 3 in normal, but since this option isn't present, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product doesn't contribute any peaks beyond what Reaction II has.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the structures of the products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → after reduction, becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Assuming this is a single stereoisomer, it would have a specific configuration.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → 2,4-pentanediol.

This product has three stereoisomers.

Now, when both products are combined, how many distinct compounds are there?

Reaction I's product: 1.

Reaction II's products:3.

Total:4 compounds.

In normal-phase HPLC: enantiomers co-elute. So, (R,R) and (S,S) from Reaction II would co-elute, and the meso is a separate peak. So, Reaction II contributes 2 peaks. Reaction I:1.

Total normal-phase:3.

Chiral HPLC: all four compounds are distinct, so 4 peaks.

Looking at options, the only one that matches is option C: 4 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal. But wait, Reaction I's product is a single compound, so why would normal-phase have 2 peaks from Reaction II and 1 from I, totaling 3. But option C says 2 peaks in normal-phase.

Hmm, perhaps Reaction I's product doesn't have any stereocenters, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the products from both reactions are the same, leading to fewer peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product and one of Reaction II's products are the same compound, reducing the total number of peaks.

But I don't think so, as they're structurally different. Reaction I's product is a hexanediol with a methoxy group, while Reaction II's product is a pentanediol.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Wait, but according to my reasoning, normal-phase would have 3 peaks. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, the best fit is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC chromatograms. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH
- **Reduction with LAH**: The ketone at position 3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter at C3. The product is **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**, which has two stereocenters (C3 and C5).
- **Outcome**: The product is a single stereoisomer due to the starting material being a single enantiomer. Thus, it contributes **1 peak** in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC.

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4
- **Reduction with NaBH4**: Each ketone group is reduced to a secondary alcohol, creating stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is **2,4-pentanediol**.
- **Possible stereoisomers**: 
  1. **(R,R)**: Enantiomer of (S,S).
  2. **(S,S)**: Enantiomer of (R,R).
  3. **Meso (R,S)**: Achiral due to symmetry.
- **Outcome**: The product is a mixture of three stereoisomers. In normal-phase HPLC, (R,R) and (S,S) co-elute as enantiomers, while the meso form elutes separately, contributing **2 peaks**. In chiral HPLC, all three stereoisomers are separated, contributing **3 peaks**.

### Combined Products
- **Reaction I**: 1 peak in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC.
- **Reaction II**: 
  - Normal-phase HPLC: 2 peaks (meso and (R,R)/(S,S)).
  - Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks (meso, (R,R), and (S,S)).

### Total Peaks
- **Normal-phase HPLC**: 1 (Reaction I) + 2 (Reaction II) = **3 peaks**.
- **Chiral HPLC**: 1 (Reaction I) + 3 (Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A (5, 4)**: Incorrect. The total peaks do not match the calculated values.
- **Option B (3, 2)**: Incorrect. The total peaks do not match the calculated values.
- **Option C (4, 2)**: Incorrect. While the chiral HPLC peaks match, the normal-phase HPLC peaks do not.
- **Option D (3, 3)**: Incorrect. The total peaks do not match the calculated values.

### Conclusion
Based on the reasoning, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it is the closest match to the calculated results.

ANSWER: C
