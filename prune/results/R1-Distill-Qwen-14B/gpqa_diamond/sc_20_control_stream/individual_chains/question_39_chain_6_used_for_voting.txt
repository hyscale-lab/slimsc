Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

Alright, the wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait. Oh, right, i is the imaginary unit, the square root of -1. But when we're dealing with wave functions, the probability density must be real and positive. So the modulus squared of ψ should be the probability density.

The problem states that when measuring the position of each particle, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. That means the wave function must be zero outside the interval [1,3]. Wait, but the wave function given is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, that can't be right because if we take the modulus squared, which is |ψ|^2, we should get a real number. Let me think.

Wait, actually, the given ψ(x) probably has a real part and an imaginary part. But for the wave function to have a non-zero probability only between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Wait, but the question says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. Oh, wait, that implies the wave function is zero outside that region. But the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) multiplied by some function, but the question says (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, perhaps that's a typo, and it's supposed to be a product, not a subtraction? Because otherwise, the wave function is a complex number for all x, which doesn't make sense if the probability is only between x=1 and x=3. Or perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says: the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So this is a complex number. The modulus squared of that would be [ (a/sqrt(1 + x) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 would be (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. But wait, the question says that when measurements are made, no particles are found outside x=1 and x=3. That implies that the probability outside that interval is zero. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero. But according to ψ as given, that's not the case unless (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i = 0 for x outside 1-3. But that would require a/sqrt(1+x) = 0.5i and the imaginary part is -0.5i. Wait, but that would require a/sqrt(1+x) = 0.5i. But sqrt(1+x) is a real number as long as x >= -1, which it is in our case. So a must be imaginary for that to happen. But I don't think that's the case because a is probably a real constant. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given only within the interval [1,3], and it's zero outside. So the actual wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i for 1 <= x <=3, and zero elsewhere. But that doesn't seem right because the wave function must be continuous, and if it's zero outside, then at x=1 and x=3, the wave function must approach zero. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the question states that the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, perhaps implying it's defined only in the region where particles can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. 

Wait, but that doesn't seem to align with the given expression. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) times e^{-i something}, but the problem states it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of normalization.

Wait, the wave function must be normalized. Meaning the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. So the normalization condition is integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx =1. 

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* is a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So |ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i) by its conjugate (a/sqrt(1+x) +0.5i), you get (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. 

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, but that's a complex number. But in reality, the wave function should be such that |ψ|^2 is real. So perhaps the given wave function is actually a real function, and the -0.5i is a typo. Hmm, that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is written as a product, but the user wrote it as a subtraction. Because without the imaginary part, the wave function would be real, and the condition that it's zero outside [1,3] would make more sense.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider. Maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but the problem states it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's wave function is in the form ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - i), but that's not what the problem says. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way the wave function is written, and the correct form is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something else. But perhaps I should proceed with the given information.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The problem states that all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, perhaps that's only valid between x=1 and x=3. So ψ(x) is zero outside [1,3], and inside that interval, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But then, wait, that would make ψ(x) zero outside, but non-zero inside. But the wave function can't just abruptly go to zero; it must be continuous. So at x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero. Let me check.

At x=1: ψ(1) = a/sqrt(2) -0.5i. For this to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. So a/sqrt(2) = 0, implying a=0, and -0.5i=0, which is impossible. So that can't be the case. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, but then we're told that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is actually ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by a complex exponential, but the problem as written uses a minus sign. Maybe I should proceed with the normalization approach, regardless of the confusion.

So, assuming that the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and it's defined only between x=1 and x=3 (since particles are found nowhere else), then the normalization condition is integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx =1.

So, |ψ(x)|² is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 3 [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx =1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, split it into two parts: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3, plus 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. Let u=1+x, du=dx. So when x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4. So ∫ from 2 to 4 (1/u) du = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and apply the normalization condition. The wave function is provided as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside the interval \(x \in [1, 3]\), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\)

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx
\]

Let \(u = 1+x\), so \(du = dx\). When \(x = 1\), \(u = 2\), and when \(x = 3\), \(u = 4\). Thus:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and apply the normalization condition. The wave function is provided as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside the interval \(x \in [1, 3]\), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\)

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx
\]

Let \(u = 1+x\), so \(du = dx\). When \(x = 1\), \(u = 2\), and when \(x = 3\), \(u = 4\). Thus:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 (\ln(4) - \ln(2)) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
