Okay, so I've got this physics question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry, and the choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) at high energies but includes additional terms (operators) that are suppressed by some high energy scale, typically the Planck scale. These operators are classified by their dimension.

Now, effective theories must respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so any effective theory built from it must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So that would mean Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely one of the correct symmetries.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The Standard Model and thus SMEFT must respect this because the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory. So operators in SMEFT should respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are likely correct.

Next, CP symmetry. Wait, the SM doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry, right? There's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. However, I'm not sure. SMEFT might include terms that violate CP, but whether they must respect it... I think the operators can have CP violation, so the symmetry doesn't have to be enforced. Therefore, I don't think option 3 (CP) is a must-respect symmetry.

Then there's CPT symmetry. CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, right? Every QFT that respects Poincare symmetry must also respect CPT symmetry. So since SMEFT is a QFT (well, an effective one), it must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So options 1,2 and 4.

Looking at the choices, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and includes additional operators suppressed by a high energy scale. These operators must respect the symmetries of the underlying SM. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz-invariant, so SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry as it builds upon the SM framework.  
2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must also respect it.  
3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry (e.g., CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry.  
4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.  

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).  

**Correct Answer**: C) 1,2,4
