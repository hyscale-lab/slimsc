Okay, so I've got this science problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs as per Einstein's theory of relativity. So, the astronaut's own experienced time, which is proper time, will be less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c. So, the time experienced by the astronaut (their proper time) would be affected by time dilation. But wait, how do I calculate that?

I think the formula for time dilation is based on the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the astronaut's own time is the proper time, which is shorter than the Earth's time. So the time measured on Earth (coordinate time) would be longer.

Wait, but the question is asking for the time from the astronaut's perspective. So the astronaut's clock runs slower compared to Earth's frame. So for them, the journey would take less time.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Let me think again. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the traveling astronaut. So from Earth's perspective, the spaceship is moving, so time on the spaceship runs slower. So the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is less than the Earth time.

But the question is about how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth, from their own perspective. So we need to calculate the proper time.

But wait, first I need to find out how far away Earth is from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, the question doesn't give the distance. Hmm, that's a problem. Because to calculate time, I need distance divided by speed. Oh, but perhaps the distance is implied as a certain value. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think the distance is approximately about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. But wait, wait, isn't the question about them traveling to Earth? So wait, the problem is that the aliens are in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 163,000 light-years away. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says the average lifetime is 150 solar years, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So their lifespan from Earth's perspective is 150 years, but from their own perspective, perhaps it's less? Or maybe that's a red herring. Wait, no, perhaps that's just background info.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the question is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective. So time experienced by astronaut = proper time.

But without the distance, how can we calculate the time? Oh wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the time from Earth's perspective, and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time. But the options don't give any time that's extremely small, so maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me reread the question.

The question is: Approximately how long will it take for their 22-year-old astronaut (from the astronaut's point of view) to reach Earth using this spacecraft?

So the time we're looking for is the proper time, tau (τ), as experienced by the astronaut.

To find τ, we can use the time dilation formula: τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in Earth's frame (i.e., the time it takes according to Earth), and v is the speed of the spacecraft.

But to find t, we need to calculate t = distance / speed.

Wait, but what's the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth? I think it's about 160,000 light-years. So let me take that as the distance. So distance d = 160,000 light-years.

But wait, the speed is 0.99999987c. So time from Earth's frame, t = d / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, and c is 1 ly/year, so t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ approximately 160,000.0000002 years. Wait, but that's an extremely small number. Wait, that can't be right because 160,000 divided by 0.99999987 is about 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) → 160,000 + 20.8 → 160,020.8 years? Wait, that's a long time.

Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait, the speed is 0.99999987c, so very close to c, so the time would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ ~160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) → 160,000 + 20.8 → ~160,020.8 years. So t ≈ 160,020.8 years from Earth's frame.

But the astronaut's experienced time τ would be t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute gamma.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ (0.99999974) c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051.

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.784.

So τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 160,020.8 * 0.00051 ≈ ?

Wait, 160,020.8 * 0.00051 → 160,020.8 * (5.1e-4) → let's compute 160,000 * 5.1e-4 = 81.6.

So τ ≈ 81.6 years.

Wait, 81 years would be the astronaut's experienced time. So the astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old when they arrive. But wait, their average lifetime is 150 years, so they would survive the trip. So the time taken from their perspective is about 81 years. So looking at the options, option C is 81 years.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Is the formula correct? Because sometimes I get confused between proper time and coordinate time.

Proper time (τ) is the time measured in the moving frame (the astronaut's frame). The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So yeah, that's correct.

But wait, the speed is so close to c that gamma is very large. But the sqrt term is small, so the product would give the proper time. So yeah, 81 years seems right.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000029 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974000029 = 0.00000025999971.

sqrt of that is approximately 0.0005099. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma is 1/0.0005099 ≈ 1960.78.

The distance is 160,000 light-years. So time from Earth's frame, t = d / v = 160000 ly / 0.99999987 c = 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 160000 + (160000 * 0.00000013) → 160000 + 20.8 ≈ 160020.8 years.

Then proper time τ = t * sqrt(...) → 160020.8 * 0.0005099.

Let me compute 160,020.8 * 0.0005099.

Approximately, 160,000 * 0.0005 is 80. So 0.0005099 is about 20% more than 0.0005, so 80 * 1.0198 ≈ 81.58 years.

So around 81.6 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years, making option C correct.

But wait, the options are A to D. Let me check:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching. So if the time is 81 years, and their age is 22, they would be 103 when they arrive. Since their average lifetime is 150, they'll live, so A is incorrect.

So the answer should be C) 81 years.

To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The astronaut's experienced time, known as proper time (τ), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (t) by the formula:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v = 0.99999987c\), the speed of the spacecraft, and \(c\) is the speed of light. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years. The time measured in Earth's frame, \(t\), is calculated as:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,020.8 \, \text{years}.
\]

Next, we calculate the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\), where:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\]

Squaring \(v/c\), we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974.
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026,
\]

and:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099.
\]

The proper time experienced by the astronaut is then:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,020.8 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
\]

From the astronaut's perspective, the journey takes approximately 81 years. Since the astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey, they would be 103 years old upon arrival. Given that their average lifetime is 150 years, they would survive the trip. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) 81 years.**

Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, and c is 1 ly/year, so t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ approximately 160,000.0000002 years. Wait, but that's an extremely small number. Wait, that can't be right because 160,000 divided by 0.99999987 is about 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) → 160,000 + 20.8 → 160,020.8 years? Wait, that's a long time.

Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait, the speed is 0.99999987c, so very close to c, so the time would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1/0.99999987) ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ ~160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) → 160,000 + 20.8 → ~160,020.8 years. So t ≈ 160,020.8 years from Earth's frame.

But the astronaut's experienced time τ would be t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute gamma.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ (0.99999974) c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051.

So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.784.

So τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 160,020.8 * 0.00051 ≈ ?

Wait, 160,020.8 * 0.00051 → 160,020.8 * (5.1e-4) → let's compute 160,000 * 5.1e-4 = 81.6.

So τ ≈ 81.6 years.

Wait, 81 years would be the astronaut's experienced time. So the astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old when they arrive.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

v = 0.99999987 c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000029 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974000029 = 0.00000025999971.

sqrt of that is approximately 0.0005099. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma is 1/0.0005099 ≈ 1960.78.

The distance is 160,000 light-years. So time from Earth's frame, t = d / v = 160000 ly / 0.99999987 c = 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 160000 + (160000 * 0.00000013) → 160000 + 20.8 ≈ 160020.8 years.

Then proper time τ = t * sqrt(...) → 160020.8 * 0.0005099.

Let me compute 160,020.8 * 0.0005099.

Approximately, 160,000 * 0.0005 is 80. So 0.0005099 is about 20% more than 0.0005, so 80 * 1.0198 ≈ 81.58 years.

So around 81.6 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years, making option C correct.

But wait, the options are A to D. Let me check:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching. So if the time is 81 years, and their age is 22, they would be 103 when they arrive. Since their average lifetime is 150, they'll live, so A is incorrect.

To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The astronaut's experienced time, known as proper time (τ), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (t) by the formula:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v = 0.99999987c\), the speed of the spacecraft, and \(c\) is the speed of light. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years. The time measured in Earth's frame, \(t\), is calculated as:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,020.8 \, \text{years}.
\]

Next, we calculate the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\), where:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\]

Squaring \(v/c\), we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974.
\]

Thus:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026,
\]

and:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099.
\]

The proper time experienced by the astronaut is then:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,020.8 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
\]

From the astronaut's perspective, the journey takes approximately 81 years. Since the astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey, they would be 103 years old upon arrival. Given that their average lifetime is 150 years, they would survive the trip. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) 81 years.**

Answer: C
