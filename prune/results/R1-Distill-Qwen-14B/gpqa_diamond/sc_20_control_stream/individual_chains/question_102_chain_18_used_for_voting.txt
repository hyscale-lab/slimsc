Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a genetic construct and why a green signal isn't observed in the mice after crossing with SOX10-Cre. Let me first try to understand the setup.

From what I remember, a bicistronic vector means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) on the same transcript, right? So in this case, the vector has the ligand ORF first, followed by the receptor ORF. Each is fused to a fluorescent marker. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

The vector uses loxP and lox2272 sites with stop cassettes. I think that these are used in Cre/LoxP recombination. The idea is that Cre will recombine the lox sites and remove the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. So, the ligand is at 5', with loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how that works. Oh right, the two different lox sites (loxP and lox2272) are recognition sites for the Cre recombinase. Cre can only recombine one or the other, depending on the strain, perhaps? Or maybe the orientation matters.

Wait, no. The key is that in a bicistronic vector, each ORF is flanked by different lox sites so that Cre can delete the stop cassette for either the ligand or the receptor. So, if the mice are homozygous for the construct, and then crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a tissue-specific Cre, then the Cre would delete the stop cassette in the tissue where SOX10 is expressed.

SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells, if I recall correctly. So the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like in the developing nervous system. So, when the Cre is expressed, it would delete the stop cassette in either the ligand or the receptor ORF.

Wait, but the vector setup is a bit confusing. The ligand is at 5', with CBA promoter, then the IRES is upstream of the receptor. Oh, wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the control of IRES. Hmm, I'm not entirely clear on that. CBA is a strong promoter, so the ligand would be expressed from the CBA promoter. Then, the IRES would drive the expression of the receptor, maybe in a way that it's co-expressed but perhaps in a different cell type or under different conditions.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is first, with its own promoter (CBA), and then the receptor is after an IRES. So, perhaps the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and then the receptor is expressed from the IRES, which might be a weaker promoter or cell-type specific.

But the presence of the stop cassettes complicates this. So, the ligand ORF (with mCherry) is followed by a stop with loxP sites. The receptor ORF (with eGFP) is after a stop with lox2272 sites. So, without Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression of the downstream ORF. So, the ligand would have its own promoter (CBA), so perhaps it's expressed, but the receptor would be under IRES, but the stop cassette would prevent eGFP expression.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ligand is under CBA promoter, so the transcript starts there. Then, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the receptor might be expressed via IRES, which is a way to have two proteins in the same transcript but under different promoters or such. I'm not entirely clear. Alternatively, the IRES could be a way to allow internal ribosome entry, so that the receptor is expressed in a different way.

But the key is that the stop cassettes are in between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. So, when Cre is present, it will recombine the lox sites and delete the stop cassette, allowing the downstream ORF to be expressed.

So, the setup is that in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since its promoter is CBA, which is strong), but the mCherry would be blocked by the stop cassette. Wait, no. Let's see: the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a stop in the loxP cassette. So, the ligand's stop is before mCherry, so without Cre, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, so mCherry won't be expressed. Or wait, perhaps the ligand is under CBA, then the ORF is followed by a stop, which is flanked by loxP sites. So, without Cre, the stop remains, preventing expression of the mCherry.

Hmm, perhaps. So in the Cre-negative situation, the ligand would be expressed (since the CBA promoter is active), but the mCherry would not. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, which is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. So, without Cre, the receptor ORF is expressed, but the eGFP is not.

Wait, no. Wait, the construct is ligand ORF (with CBA promoter) fused to mCherry, then a loxP-stop-loxP, then the receptor ORF (with IRES upstream), followed by a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP. So, the two ORFs are on the same transcript? Or on separate transcripts? Hmm.

Wait, bicistronic vectors are usually designed to have two ORFs on the same transcript, controlled by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) so that two proteins are produced from one mRNA. So, in this case, the first ORF is the ligand, under CBA promoter, then an IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by the stop and eGFP.

But the stop cassettes complicate that. So, in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the downstream ORF to be expressed. So, if Cre is active, it would delete the stop cassette for either the ligand or the receptor.

Wait, but the ligand's stop is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So, perhaps Cre is used to delete the stop and allow mCherry to be expressed as a fusion protein with the ligand. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

But then, the question says that after plasmid transfection, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested on Western blot. So, presumably, the construct is expressed in the cells, but perhaps the stop cassettes are preventing expression.

Wait, but this is about the mouse model. The mice are homozygous for the construct in a wt background. Then they crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells and their derivatives.

So, in the offspring, the SOX10-Cre would be active in neural crest cells, which would lead to Cre recombination in those cells. So, the Cre would delete the stop cassettes in those cells, allowing the expression of either ligand-mCherry or receptor-eGFP.

But the question says that when they visualize the offspring under a confocal microscope, they don't see a green signal. eGFP is green, so the eGFP should be expressed if the receptor is expressed.

So, why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Not sure how this would affect expression. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells, but expression-wise, they should still be expressed.

Option B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So, perhaps it's not trafficked to the cell surface. But the question is about expression, not function. The Western blot would show the protein, regardless of trafficking. But the question says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins on Western blot. If the construct wasn't expressed, the Western blot wouldn't show it. But the question mentions that the Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocyte culture, so perhaps the construct is expressed in vitro. But in the mice, maybe not.

Option C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Hmm, the construct has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter, so this might not be the case. Unless the IRES for the receptor doesn't have a proper enhancer.

Option D) the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So, perhaps the stop cassette removal would leave the ORF out of frame, so the eGFP isn't properly expressed. But wait, the stop cassette is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So, if the stop is removed, then the receptor would be expressed, and the eGFP would be in frame. Or wait, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So, if the stop is removed, the receptor ORF would continue into the eGFP, but would that be in frame?

Wait, no, because the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So, when Cre removes the stop, the ORF would go from receptor to eGFP. So, the eGFP would be in frame if the stop is removed, right? Unless there's a frame shift. But in the construct, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So, the stop is just a stop codon, then the lox sites.

Hmm. So, when Cre removes the lox2272 sites and the stop, the receptor ORF would be followed by eGFP in frame. So, the receptor-eGFP would be a fusion protein. But if the reading frame is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed properly.

Wait, perhaps the stop is actually a stop codon within the eGFP ORF. So, if the stop is removed, the ORF continues into eGFP, but if the frame is off, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly produced. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly in frame because the stop is in the wrong place. Wait, the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So, the sequence would be Receptor ORF followed by lox2272 sites and a stop. So, when Cre removes the lox sites and the stop, the Receptor ORF would end, and then eGFP would start. But perhaps the way this is inserted causes the eGFP to be out of frame, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP expression.

But that's a possibility for option D.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so perhaps if the IRES isn't effective, the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to allow internal ribosome entry, so the receptor would be co-expressed with the ligand.

Wait, but the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand ORF. So, when the CBA promoter drives the transcript, the ribosome would translate the ligand, then perhaps the IRES allows another round of translation for the receptor. So, both ligand and receptor would be expressed.

But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the setup. Let me try to imagine the construct:

The vector is a bicistronic plasmid, so two ORFs: Ligand and Receptor.

Structure:

5' [CBA promoter] [Ligand ORF] [loxP-stop-loxP] [Receptor ORF] [IRES] [lox2272-stop-lox2272] [eGFP] 3'

Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So, the structure is:

5' [CBA promoter] [Ligand ORF] [loxP-stop-loxP] [IRES] [Receptor ORF] [lox2272-stop-lox2272] [eGFP] 3'

Wait, that can't be right. Or perhaps the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. So, the construct is:

5' [CBA promoter] [Ligand ORF] [IRES] [Receptor ORF] [stop (lox2272)] [eGFP] 3'

But with the ligand ORF followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the ligand ORF. Then, the IRES allows for the translation of the receptor ORF. But both the ligand and receptor ORFs have stop cassettes, which block the expression of the fluorescent proteins unless Cre deletes them.

Wait, so the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop cassette blocks mCherry unless Cre deletes it. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed as a fusion with eGFP, but the stop cassette blocks eGFP unless Cre deletes it.

Wait, no, perhaps the ligand ORF is followed by the stop cassette, then the mCherry. So the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop cassette is between ligand and mCherry, so without Cre, mCherry isn't expressed.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP. So, without Cre, eGFP isn't expressed. But when Cre is present, it deletes the stop cassettes, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

So, in the mice, when Cre is active (in neural crest cells), the stop cassettes are deleted, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

But the problem states that in the offspring, they don't see the green signal. So, eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop cassette is removed, the receptor ORF would be followed by eGFP. If the two are not in frame, the eGFP won't be correctly expressed. So, the fusion would result in a nonfunctional eGFP, or perhaps no eGFP at all because the ribosome would terminate due to a frameshift.

So, that could explain the lack of green signal.

Alternatively, option B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, but the Western blot would still detect the protein. Since the question says that after plasmid transfection, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, implying that the proteins are expressed. But in the mice, perhaps they're not.

Wait, but the question is about the mouse model. If the construct is correctly inserted and Cre is active, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the eGFP is not in frame, it won't be expressed.

So, in this case, the Western blot in vitro (transfection to astrocytes) would show the proteins, but in the mouse, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive translation after the ligand ORF.

Wait, the construct is designed for the ligand to be expressed under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. So, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly, so the receptor isn't expressed even after Cre recombination.

But the question says that the mice are homozygous for the construct. So, perhaps the IRES is functional, but the stop cassette for eGFP is still present. Or no, because Cre should remove it.

Wait, no. When the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should delete the lox2272 stop cassette in the neural crest cells. So, the receptor-eGFP would be expressed, but if the eGFP is out of frame, then no signal.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette isn't properly flanked, so the Cre can't remove it, but that's probably not the case.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being translated correctly because the stop cassette removal didn't happen, but in that case, the green signal wouldn't be present. But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the problem states that the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, the Cre is active in the neural crest, which should delete the lox2272 stop cassette, allowing eGFP expression.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, then it won't be expressed. So, the problem might be with the frame.

So, looking at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't properly expressed, resulting in no green signal.

Another option is option C: the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong, so the enhancer might not be the issue.

Alternatively, option B: the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. If that were the case, eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, but the Western blot would show the protein. Since the question mentions that the Western blot after transfection gives a signal proportional to actin, maybe the proteins are expressed. But in the mouse, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But that would affect the ligand as well.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (but mCherry not expressed). The receptor would be under IRES, so perhaps not expressed without Cre. But when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, but the problem says that after the mice are born, they were visualized under a confocal. The green signal is from eGFP, but it's not observed. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, possible reasons include:

- The lox2272 stop cassette wasn't properly deleted (but why?), but the mouse is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre.

- The IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed even after Cre.

- The eGFP is not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the gene is not correctly expressed.

Hmm. Another angle: the vector has the ligand ORF at 5' end, and the receptor at 3' end. The stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and receptor and eGFP. So, when Cre deletes the stops, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

But perhaps the way the stop cassettes are placed causes the reading frame to be incorrect, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So, if the stop is flanked by lox2272 sites and the ORF is in the same reading frame, then removing the stop would allow eGFP to be in frame. But if the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP won't be expressed.

So, the problem is that the receptor ORF and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

That would explain why there's no green signal. So, option D is the correct answer.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor in a tissue-specific manner using SOX10-Cre. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Each ORF is flanked by stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP for the ligand and lox2272-stop-lox2272 for the receptor), which block expression of the downstream fluorescent proteins (mCherry for the ligand and eGFP for the receptor) in the absence of Cre. SOX10-Cre is expected to delete the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells, allowing expression of the fluorescent proteins.

Key observations and reasoning:

1. **Construct Design**: The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them. The receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between them. Without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. Cre recombination deletes the stop cassettes, allowing expression of the fluorescent proteins.

2. **Transfection and Western Blot**: After transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the proteins are expressed in vitro. However, in the mouse model, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Option A (Paracrine relationship)**: A paracrine relationship between the ligand and receptor does not explain the lack of eGFP expression. This option is irrelevant to the expression issue.
   - **Option B (Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi)**: If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, the Western blot would still detect the protein, as it would be synthesized but not trafficked to the cell surface. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.
   - **Option C (Missing enhancer)**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which does not rely on tissue-specific enhancers. The IRES for the receptor is functional, so this is unlikely to be the issue.
   - **Option D (Receptor and eGFP not in frame)**: The stop cassettes are positioned between the receptor ORF and eGFP. If the stop cassette removal results in a frameshift, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This is the most plausible explanation for the lack of green signal.

4. **Conclusion**: The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame after Cre-mediated removal of the stop cassette, preventing proper expression of eGFP.

Answer: D

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a genetic construct and why a green signal isn't observed in the mice after crossing with SOX10-Cre. Let me first try to understand the setup.

From what I remember, a bicistronic vector means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) on the same transcript, right? So in this case, the vector has the ligand ORF first, followed by the receptor ORF. Each is fused to a fluorescent marker. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

The vector uses loxP and lox2272 sites with stop cassettes. I think that these are used in Cre/LoxP recombination. The idea is that Cre will recombine the lox sites and remove the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. So, the ligand is at 5', with loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how that works. Oh right, the two different lox sites (loxP and lox2272) are recognition sites for the Cre recombinase. Cre can only recombine one or the other, depending on the strain, perhaps? Or maybe the orientation matters.

Wait, no. The key is that in a bicistronic vector, each ORF is flanked by different lox sites so that Cre can delete the stop cassette for either the ligand or the receptor. So, if the mice are homozygous for the construct, and then crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a tissue-specific Cre, then the Cre would delete the stop cassette in the tissue where SOX10 is expressed.

SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells, if I recall correctly. So the Cre would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like in the developing nervous system. So, when the Cre is expressed, it would delete the stop cassette in either the ligand or the receptor ORF.

Wait, but the vector setup is a bit confusing. The ligand is at 5', with CBA promoter, then the IRES is upstream of the receptor. Oh, wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the control of IRES. Hmm, I'm not entirely clear on that. CBA is a strong promoter, so the ligand would be expressed from the CBA promoter. Then, the IRES would drive the expression of the receptor, maybe in a way that it's co-expressed but perhaps in a different cell type or under different conditions.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is first, with its own promoter (CBA), and then the receptor is after an IRES. So, perhaps the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and then the receptor is expressed from the IRES, which might be a weaker promoter or cell-type specific.

But the presence of the stop cassettes complicates this. So, the ligand ORF (with mCherry) is followed by a stop with loxP sites. The receptor ORF (with eGFP) is after a stop with lox2272 sites. So, without Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression of the downstream ORF. So, the ligand would have its own promoter (CBA), so perhaps it's expressed, but the receptor would be under IRES, but the stop cassette would prevent eGFP expression.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ligand is under CBA promoter, so the transcript starts there. Then, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the receptor might be expressed via IRES, which is a way to have two proteins in the same transcript but under different promoters or such. I'm not entirely clear. Alternatively, the IRES could be a way to allow internal ribosome entry, so that the receptor is expressed in a different way.

But the key is that the stop cassettes are in between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. So, when Cre is present, it will recombine the lox sites and delete the stop cassette, allowing the downstream ORF to be expressed.

So, the setup is that in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since its promoter is CBA, which is strong), but the mCherry would be blocked by the stop cassette. Wait, no. Let's see: the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a stop in the loxP cassette. So, the ligand's stop is before mCherry, so without Cre, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, so mCherry won't be expressed. Or wait, perhaps the ligand is under CBA, then the ORF is followed by a stop, which is flanked by loxP sites. So, without Cre, the stop remains, preventing expression of the mCherry.

Hmm, perhaps. So in the Cre-negative situation, the ligand would be expressed (since the CBA promoter is active), but the mCherry would not. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, which is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. So, without Cre, the receptor ORF is expressed, but the eGFP is not.

Wait, no. Wait, the construct is ligand ORF (with CBA promoter) fused to mCherry, then a loxP-stop-loxP, then the receptor ORF (with IRES upstream), followed by a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP. So, the two ORFs are on the same transcript? Or on separate transcripts? Hmm.

Wait, bicistronic vectors are usually designed to have two ORFs on the same transcript, controlled by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) so that two proteins are produced from one mRNA. So, in this case, the first ORF is the ligand, under CBA promoter, then an IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by the stop and eGFP.

But the stop cassettes complicate that. So, in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the downstream ORF to be expressed. So, if Cre is active, it would delete the stop cassette for either the ligand or the receptor.

Wait, but the ligand's stop is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So, perhaps Cre is used to delete the stop and allow mCherry to be expressed as a fusion protein with the ligand. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

But then, the question says that after plasmid transfection, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested on Western blot. So, presumably, the construct is expressed in the cells, but perhaps the stop cassettes are preventing expression.

Wait, but this is about the mouse model. The mice are homozygous for the construct in a wt background. Then they crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells and their derivatives.

So, in the offspring, the SOX10-Cre would be active in neural crest cells, which would lead to Cre recombination in those cells. So, the Cre would delete the stop cassettes in those cells, allowing the expression of either ligand-mCherry or receptor-eGFP.

But the question says that when they visualize the offspring under a confocal microscope, they don't see a green signal. eGFP is green, so the eGFP should be expressed if the receptor is expressed.

So, why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Not sure how this would affect expression. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells, but expression-wise, they should still be expressed.

Option B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So, perhaps it's not trafficked to the cell surface. But the question is about expression, not function. The Western blot would show the protein, regardless of trafficking. But the question says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins on Western blot. If the construct wasn't expressed, the Western blot wouldn't show it. But the question mentions that the Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocyte culture, so perhaps the construct is expressed in vitro. But in the mice, maybe not.

Option C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Hmm, the construct has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter, so this might not be the case. Unless the IRES for the receptor doesn't have a proper enhancer.

Option D) the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So, perhaps the stop cassette removal would leave the ORF out of frame, so the eGFP isn't properly expressed. But wait, the stop cassette is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So, if the stop is removed, then the receptor would be expressed, and the eGFP would be in frame. Or wait, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So, if the stop is removed, the receptor ORF would continue into the eGFP, but would that be in frame?

Wait, no, because the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So, when Cre removes the stop, the ORF would go from receptor to eGFP. So, the eGFP would be in frame if the stop is removed, right? Unless there's a frame shift. But in the construct, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So, the stop is just a stop codon, then the lox sites.

Hmm. So, when Cre removes the lox2272 sites and the stop, the receptor ORF would be followed by eGFP in frame. So, the receptor-eGFP would be a fusion protein. But if the reading frame is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed properly.

Wait, perhaps the stop is actually a stop codon within the eGFP ORF. So, if the stop is removed, the ORF continues into eGFP, but if the frame is off, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly produced. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly in frame because the stop is in the wrong place. Wait, the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So, the sequence would be Receptor ORF followed by lox2272 sites and a stop. So, when Cre removes the lox sites and the stop, the Receptor ORF would end, and then eGFP would start. But perhaps the way this is inserted causes the eGFP to be out of frame, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP expression.

But that's a possibility for option D.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so perhaps if the IRES isn't effective, the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to allow internal ribosome entry, so the receptor would be co-expressed with the ligand.

Wait, but the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand ORF. So, when the CBA promoter drives the transcript, the ribosome would translate the ligand, then perhaps the IRES allows another round of translation for the receptor. So, both ligand and receptor would be expressed.

But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the setup. Let me try to imagine the construct:

The vector is a bicistronic plasmid, so two ORFs: Ligand and Receptor.

Structure:

5' [CBA promoter] [Ligand ORF] [loxP-stop-loxP] [Receptor ORF] [IRES] [lox2272-stop-lox2272] [eGFP] 3'

Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So, the structure is:

5' [CBA promoter] [Ligand ORF] [loxP-stop-loxP] [IRES] [Receptor ORF] [lox2272-stop-lox2272] [eGFP] 3'

Wait, that can't be right. Or perhaps the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. So, the construct is:

5' [CBA promoter] [Ligand ORF] [IRES] [Receptor ORF] [stop (lox2272)] [eGFP] 3'

But with the ligand ORF followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the ligand ORF. Then, the IRES allows for the translation of the receptor ORF. But both the ligand and receptor ORFs have stop cassettes, which block the expression of the fluorescent proteins unless Cre deletes them.

Wait, so the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop cassette blocks mCherry unless Cre deletes it. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed as a fusion with eGFP, but the stop cassette blocks eGFP unless Cre deletes it.

Wait, no, perhaps the ligand ORF is followed by the stop cassette, then the mCherry. So the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop cassette is between ligand and mCherry, so without Cre, mCherry isn't expressed.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP. So, without Cre, eGFP isn't expressed. But when Cre is present, it deletes the stop cassettes, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

So, in the mice, when Cre is active (in neural crest cells), the stop cassettes are deleted, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

But the problem states that in the offspring, they don't see the green signal. So, eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop cassette is removed, the receptor ORF would be followed by eGFP. If the two are not in frame, the eGFP won't be correctly expressed. So, the fusion would result in a nonfunctional eGFP, or perhaps no eGFP at all because the ribosome would terminate due to a frameshift.

So, that could explain the lack of green signal.

Alternatively, option B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, but the Western blot would still detect the protein. Since the question says that after plasmid transfection, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, implying that the proteins are expressed. But in the mice, perhaps they're not.

Wait, but the question is about the mouse model. If the construct is correctly inserted and Cre is active, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the eGFP is not in frame, it won't be expressed.

So, in this case, the Western blot in vitro (transfection to astrocytes) would show the proteins, but in the mouse, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive translation after the ligand ORF.

Wait, the construct is designed for the ligand to be expressed under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. So, perhaps the IRES isn't working correctly, so the receptor isn't expressed even after Cre recombination.

But the question says that the mice are homozygous for the construct. So, perhaps the IRES is functional, but the stop cassette for eGFP is still present. Or no, because Cre should remove it.

Wait, no. When the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should delete the lox2272 stop cassette in the neural crest cells. So, the receptor-eGFP would be expressed, but if the eGFP is out of frame, then no signal.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassette isn't properly flanked, so the Cre can't remove it, but that's probably not the case.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being translated correctly because the stop cassette removal didn't happen, but in that case, the green signal wouldn't be present. But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the problem states that the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, the Cre is active in the neural crest, which should delete the lox2272 stop cassette, allowing eGFP expression.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, then it won't be expressed. So, the problem might be with the frame.

So, looking at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't properly expressed, resulting in no green signal.

Another option is option C: the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong, so the enhancer might not be the issue.

Alternatively, option B: the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. If that were the case, eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, but the Western blot would show the protein. Since the question mentions that the Western blot after transfection gives a signal proportional to actin, maybe the proteins are expressed. But in the mouse, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But that would affect the ligand as well.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (but mCherry not expressed). The receptor would be under IRES, so perhaps not expressed without Cre. But when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, but the problem says that after the mice are born, they were visualized under a confocal. The green signal is from eGFP, but it's not observed. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, possible reasons include:

- The lox2272 stop cassette wasn't properly deleted (but why?), but the mouse is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre.

- The IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed even after Cre.

- The eGFP is not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the gene is not correctly expressed.

Hmm. Another angle: the vector has the ligand ORF at 5' end, and the receptor at 3' end. The stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and receptor and eGFP. So, when Cre deletes the stops, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

But perhaps the way the stop cassettes are placed causes the reading frame to be incorrect, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So, if the stop is flanked by lox2272 sites and the ORF is in the same reading frame, then removing the stop would allow eGFP to be in frame. But if the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP won't be expressed.

So, the problem is that the receptor ORF and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

That would explain why there's no green signal. So, option D is the correct answer.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor in a tissue-specific manner using SOX10-Cre. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Each ORF is flanked by stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP for the ligand and lox2272-stop-lox2272 for the receptor), which block expression of the downstream fluorescent proteins (mCherry for the ligand and eGFP for the receptor) in the absence of Cre. SOX10-Cre is expected to delete the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells, allowing expression of the fluorescent proteins.

Key observations and reasoning:

1. **Construct Design**: The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them. The receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between them. Without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. Cre recombination deletes the stop cassettes, allowing expression of the fluorescent proteins.

2. **Transfection and Western Blot**: After transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that the proteins are expressed in vitro. However, in the mouse model, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Option A (Paracrine relationship)**: A paracrine relationship between the ligand and receptor does not explain the lack of eGFP expression. This option is irrelevant to the expression issue.
   - **Option B (Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi)**: If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, the Western blot would still detect the protein, as it would be synthesized but not trafficked to the cell surface. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.
   - **Option C (Missing enhancer)**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which does not rely on tissue-specific enhancers. The IRES for the receptor is functional, so this is unlikely to be the issue.
   - **Option D (Receptor and eGFP not in frame)**: The stop cassettes are positioned between the receptor ORF and eGFP. If the stop cassette removal results in a frameshift, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This is the most plausible explanation for the lack of green signal.

4. **Conclusion**: The absence of the green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame after Cre-mediated removal of the stop cassette, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
