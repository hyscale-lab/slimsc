Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, which I think means their orbital periods have a ratio that's simple, but the given ratios here are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, that's for the periods of each planet, right?

The planets are labeled Planet_1 through Planet_5. The key here is that they have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't factor into the temperature difference. We need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So, T4 over T2, or T2 over T4?

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. It's T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/sigma )^0.25. But since albedo is the same for all, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the main factors are the star's temperature (which I assume is the same for all since it's the same star) and the orbital distance 'a'.

The formula simplifies when comparing planets around the same star. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on the inverse square root of the ratio of their orbital distances. Wait, no—because the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the square root of the star's luminosity over (16 pi sigma a²), but since luminosity and sigma are constants here, the important part is a.

So the equilibrium temperature T for a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance a. So T ∝ 1/√a. So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Because if a is larger, T is smaller, so T4 is for a4, T2 for a2. So the ratio is sqrt(a2 / a4).

Wait, but wait. The orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, for each planet, their orbital periods are in those ratios. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2P1, and so on.

But Kepler's third law says that (P^2)/(a^3) = const, assuming same star. So, P² is proportional to a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the orbital distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a2 = (P2)^(2/3) / (P1)^(2/3) * a1. Wait, perhaps I should express each a in terms of a1.

Let me think. Let me denote the orbital period of Planet_1 as P1. Then:

P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

So P2 = 2 P1.

P3 = 2.5 P1.

P4 = 3.5 P1.

P5 =5 P1.

From Kepler's third law: a^3 is proportional to P². So a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant based on the star.

So the ratio of a for each planet is a_i = (P_i / P1)^(2/3) * a1.

So a2 = (2 P1 / P1)^(2/3) * a1 = 2^(2/3) a1.

Similarly, a4 = (3.5 P1 / P1)^(2/3) a1 = (3.5)^(2/3) a1.

So the ratio a2 / a4 is [ (2)^(2/3) / (3.5)^(2/3) ) ] = (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = [ (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/2) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me double-check. T is proportional to 1/√a. So T4 = T1 * (a1 / a4 )^(1/2), and T2 = T1 * (a1 / a2 )^(1/2).

So the ratio T4/T2 = [ (a1/a4) / (a1/a2) ) ]^(1/2) = (a2/a4)^(1/2).

So yes, same as above.

So let's compute 2/3.5 first. 2 is 2, 3.5 is 7/2. So 2/(7/2) )= 4/7.

So (4/7) is the fraction. So (4/7)^(1/3) is the ratio.

Wait, wait, no. Because (a2/a4) is (2^(2/3) a1) / (3.5^(2/3) a1) ) = (2/3.5)^(2/3). So T4/T2 = sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

So let's compute 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately?

Hmm, cube root of 0.5 is about 0.7937, cube root of 0.5714 would be a bit higher. Alternatively, let me compute it numerically.

Let me think: 0.5714^(1/3)

We can approximate. Let's think of numbers whose cubes are near 0.57.

0.8^3=0.512.

0.83^3 = ?

0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.5717.

Wait, that's close to 0.5714. So 0.83^3≈0.5717. So the cube root of ~0.5714 is about 0.83.

So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait, the question is the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2. So that's T4/T2 ≈0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, and option D is ~0.75.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up which planet is which. The question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So is it T4 over T2, or T2 over T4?

Wait, the question says: what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2? So the order matters. But it's not clear if it's T4/T2 or T2/T4. The way the options are presented, I think the ratio is T4 to T2. Because if the periods are in the order 1,2,2.5,3.5,5, then P4 is longer than P2. Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), a4 is larger than a2. So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T4 is smaller than T2. So T4/T2 is less than 1. So the ratio would be roughly 0.83, so option C.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 4/7 is 0.57142857.

Cube root of x where x=0.57142857.

I can compute it with logarithms.

ln(0.57142857) is approximately ln(0.5714) ≈ -0.5596.

Divide by 3: -0.1865.

Exponential: e^-0.1865 ≈ 0.8305.

So 0.8305 is the cube root of 0.5714.

So T4/T2 is ~0.83.

So the answer should be option C, which is ~0.83.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto P^2 \), the orbital distance \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \).

Let the orbital period of Planet_1 be \( P_1 \). Then:
- \( P_2 = 2P_1 \),
- \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \).

The orbital distances are proportional to:
\[
a_2 \propto (P_2)^{2/3} = (2P_1)^{2/3} = 2^{2/3} \cdot a_1,
\]
\[
a_4 \propto (P_4)^{2/3} = (3.5P_1)^{2/3} = 3.5^{2/3} \cdot a_1.
\]

The ratio of orbital distances is:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \frac{2^{2/3}}{3.5^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Since \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplify \( \frac{2}{3.5} \):
\[
\frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

From the options provided:
- Option A: \( \sim 0.57 \),
- Option B: \( \sim 0.69 \),
- Option C: \( \sim 0.83 \),
- Option D: \( \sim 0.75 \),

the correct answer is **C**, as it matches the calculated ratio.

Wait, but wait. The orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, for each planet, their orbital periods are in those ratios. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2P1, and so on.

But Kepler's third law says that (P^2)/(a^3) = const, assuming same star. So, P² is proportional to a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the orbital distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a2 = (P2)^(2/3) / (P1)^(2/3) * a1. Wait, perhaps I should express each a in terms of a1.

Let me think. Let me denote the orbital period of Planet_1 as P1. Then:

P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

So P2 = 2 P1.

P3 = 2.5 P1.

P4 = 3.5 P1.

P5 =5 P1.

From Kepler's third law: a^3 is proportional to P². So a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant based on the star.

So the ratio of a for each planet is a_i = (P_i / P1)^(2/3) * a1.

So a2 = (2 P1 / P1)^(2/3) * a1 = 2^(2/3) a1.

Similarly, a4 = (3.5 P1 / P1)^(2/3) a1 = (3.5)^(2/3) a1.

So the ratio a2 / a4 is [ (2)^(2/3) / (3.5)^(2/3) ) ] = (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Then, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = [ (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/2) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me double-check. T is proportional to 1/√a. So T4 = T1 * (a1 / a4 )^(1/2), and T2 = T1 * (a1 / a2 )^(1/2).

So the ratio T4/T2 = [ (a1/a4) / (a1/a2) ) ]^(1/2) = (a2/a4)^(1/2).

So yes, same as above.

So let's compute 2/3.5 first. 2 is 2, 3.5 is 7/2. So 2/(7/2) )= 4/7.

So (4/7) is the fraction. So (4/7)^(1/3) is the ratio.

Wait, wait, no. Because (a2/a4) is (2^(2/3) a1) / (3.5^(2/3) a1) ) = (2/3.5)^(2/3). So T4/T2 = sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

So let's compute 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately?

Hmm, cube root of 0.5 is about 0.7937, cube root of 0.5714 would be a bit higher. Alternatively, let me compute it numerically.

0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.5717.

Wait, that's close to 0.5714. So 0.83^3≈0.5717. So the cube root of ~0.5714 is about 0.83.

So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait, the question is the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2. So that's T4/T2 ≈0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, and option D is ~0.75.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up which planet is which. The question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So is it T4 over T2, or T2 over T4?

So the ratio would be roughly 0.83, so option C.

Wait, 4/7 is 0.57142857.

Cube root of x where x=0.57142857.

So the answer should be option C, which is ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \).

Let the orbital period of Planet_1 be \( P_1 \). Then:
- \( P_2 = 2P_1 \),
- \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \).

The orbital distances are proportional to:
\[

\[
a_4 \propto (P_4)^{2/3} = (3.5P_1)^{2/3} = 3.5^{2/3} \cdot a_1.
\]

The ratio of orbital distances is:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \frac{2^{2/3}}{3.5^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Since \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplify \( \frac{2}{3.5} \):
\[
\frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

The cube root of \( 0.5714 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).
