Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to find how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The problem states that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with given values Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The options are A to D.

Wait, I think in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage isn't constant like in a regular cyclotron. Oh right, the frequency changes over time to match the proton's increasing speed. But how does that affect the number of revolutions?

I remember that the number of revolutions a particle makes in a synchrocyclotron can be calculated based on the energy gained. The voltage provides energy each time the proton goes around the ring. But wait, how much energy per revolution?

Each time the proton completes a half-revolution, it gains energy from the voltage. Because the voltage is alternating, the proton gets a push each time it passes through the gap. So for each full cycle of the voltage, the proton makes a certain number of revolutions.

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula. I think the number of revolutions N is related to the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

Proton's charge is e. The energy gained per revolution would be e multiplied by the voltage, but wait, because the voltage is applied each half-period, maybe. Or is it each full period? Let's think: in a cyclotron, the voltage alternates, providing energy each time the particle passes through the gap. So each time the particle does a half-revolution, it gains e*U0. Because the field reverses every half period, so the particle gets a push each time it goes through the gap. So for each full revolution, the particle passes through the gap twice, once for each half of the cycle.

Wait, no, maybe each time the voltage completes a cycle, the particle gains energy once. Or perhaps each time it completes a half-revolution, it gains energy once. Let me clarify.

In a cyclotron, the acceleration is applied twice per revolution because the voltage switches polarity every half-period. So a full revolution would involve two applications of the voltage. So each revolution gives the proton an energy of 2eU0.

Wait, but wait, the acceleration voltage is applied in the gaps between the D-shaped electrodes. Each time the particle passes through a gap, it receives a kick. Since the gaps are opposite each other, the particle passes through one gap, then the other, each time with the voltage perhaps opposite. So for each full revolution, the particle goes through two gaps. But because the voltage alternates each time, the phase changes.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let me think about the basic energy gain.

The energy per revolution is e multiplied by the peak voltage U0. Because each time the proton completes a revolution, it goes through the accelerating gap once. Or twice? I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let's think about it. The voltage is applied as a function of time: U(t) = U0 cos(...). The particle goes around in a circular path, and each time it passes through the gap, it gains energy e*U(t) at that moment. The maximum energy it can gain per pass is when the cosine is at maximum, which is U0. So each time it goes through the gap, it gains e*U0 (since that's the peak). But wait, the phase Φ0 is π/4, so the initial phase is 45 degrees. Hmm, but maybe that doesn't affect the number of revolutions, just the initial acceleration phase.

Wait, but the revolutions are determined by how many times the proton goes around while it's being accelerated until it reaches the desired energy. So the key is to find how many times the proton goes through the accelerating gaps, each time gaining energy.

But each time the proton completes a revolution, it passes through the gap once. Or perhaps twice? Because the cyclotron has two gaps, each 180 degrees apart. So each time the proton does a full 360-degree revolution, it passes through each gap once. So each revolution allows it to gain energy twice? Or once, depending on how the setup is.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula or approach. I recall that in a cyclotron, the number of revolutions N can be found using the formula:

N = (ΔT) / (e * U0) + 1

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the total energy gained is e * U0 * N, where N is the number of times the particle passes through the accelerating gap. Because each time it goes through, it can gain e*U0 (at the peak). But wait, the voltage is varying with time, so the actual energy per pass is e * U(t) at that time. But in this problem, they might be assuming that each time it passes through, it gains e*U0, perhaps as an average.

Wait, but the problem gives U(t) = U0 cos(...), so the maximum is U0 and the minimum is -U0. But since the proton is accelerated, perhaps it only uses the positive peaks. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each full cycle of the voltage (period T) corresponds to the proton completing one revolution. Because the frequency of the voltage is set to match the proton's rotation frequency.

Wait, yes, in a cyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is synchronized with the rotation frequency of the particle. So each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton has made one revolution.

Wait, but in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, which limits the maximum energy because as the particle gains energy, its speed increases, so the rotation period changes. But the synchrocyclotron uses a varying frequency to match the changing speed so that the frequency of the applied voltage stays in sync with the rotation frequency of the proton.

So the key here is that each revolution, the proton gains a certain amount of energy, and the frequency of the voltage is adjusted so that it's always in phase with the proton's rotation.

But I'm not entirely clear on how to calculate the number of revolutions from the energy. Let's think about the energy gained.

Each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy. But in a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap, but the time between each acceleration increases as the proton's speed increases.

Wait, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is e * U0. Because each revolution corresponds to one application of the peak voltage. Because the voltage is applied once per revolution.

But wait, no. Because the voltage is an alternating voltage, so each half-period would change the direction. So maybe each revolution would involve two applications of the voltage. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the voltage is applied as a function that has a peak every half cycle, so each time the proton goes through the gap, it gets a push. So each revolution would involve two such pushes. But then this would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total energy gained. The initial energy is zero, and the final energy is 950 MeV. The energy gained per revolution would be e multiplied by the voltage. But since the voltage has amplitude U0, which is 190 kV.

Wait, but U0 is given as 190 kV. So the charge e times U0 is 1.6e-19 * 190e3 = about 2.88e-14 J. But the kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV, which is 950e6 * 1.6e-13 J = 1.52e-4 J.

Wait, but that's a very rough calculation. Let me compute it properly.

e * U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * (190e3 V) = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = approx 3.04e-14 J.

The total energy needed is 950 MeV. Converting that to Joules: 950e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 950e6 * 1.602e-19 = 1.5219e-11 J.

So the number of revolutions N would be total energy divided by energy per revolution.

So N ≈ (1.5219e-11 J) / (3.04e-14 J/rev) ≈ about 50,000 rev? But looking at the options, the choices are around 1800, 2500, 3500, 5300. So 50000 isn't an option. Hmm, so that approach must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the energy per revolution is more than that. Because each revolution might involve two applications of the voltage. So perhaps per revolution, the proton gains 2eU0.

Let me recalculate.

Energy per revolution = 2 * e * U0 = 2 *3.04e-14 J =6.08e-14 J.

Then N = 1.5219e-11 /6.08e-14 ≈ approx 2500 rev.

Looking at the options, D is 2500. So that's an option.

But wait, the formula I'm using assumes that each revolution involves two applications of eU0, so the energy per revolution is 2eU0. But why two?

Because in a cyclotron, the two D-shaped electrodes are positioned such that the proton passes through each one once per revolution. So each time it goes through a gap, it gets a kick. Since the voltage alternates every half-period, the two gaps are 180 degrees apart. So each revolution, the proton passes through each gap once, but the voltage is at opposite polarities. But since the proton is moving in a circle, it might only be accelerated in one of the gaps each time. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps in a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through a gap, it gains energy. Since there are two gaps, each 180 degrees apart, each full revolution (360 degrees) allows the proton to pass through each gap once. So two acceleration events per revolution. Therefore, the energy per revolution would be 2eU0, assuming maximum voltage each time.

So using that, N = T_total / (2eU0) = 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) ?

Wait, wait! Let's think in terms of eV. Because the energy is in eV, but the voltage is in volts. Let me compute it in eV.

Each time the proton passes through a gap, it gains e * U(t). Since U(t) can be up to U0 (190 kV), so each pass gives 190 keV. But how many passes per revolution?

If each revolution involves two passes, then each revolution adds 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV.

So the total number of revolutions N would be total energy (950 MeV) divided by energy per revolution (380 keV) = 950e3 keV / 380 keV/rev = 950e3 /380 ≈ 2500 rev. Which is option D.

But wait, the initial energy is negligible, so the total energy gained is approximately 950 MeV. So N = 950e3 / 380 ≈ 2500.

So the answer would be D) 2500.

Wait, but wait a moment. The problem statement says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, two accelerations? So perhaps each time it goes through two gaps, so two accelerations, so each revolution gives two energy gains. But I'm not sure what that implies.

Wait, perhaps the term 'two accelerations' refers to the fact that each revolution involves two acceleration events. So, each acceleration gives eU0, so each revolution gives 2eU0. So the calculation above holds.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton makes a half-revolution, it gains eU0, so each full revolution gains 2eU0. So for 950 MeV, it would be 950e6 eV divided by (2*190e3 eV) = 950e6 / 380e3 = 950000 /380 = approximately 2500.

So that would give option D.

Another thing to consider: in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage isn't constant. It varies to match the proton's changing speed. So the number of revolutions depends on how the frequency changes as the proton gains energy. But the question seems to be pointing towards an approximate calculation based on the energy.

Wait, but wait another point: the formula for the number of revolutions might be more precise. Let me think about how the energy is related to the number of revolutions.

In a synchrocyclotron, the time for each revolution increases as the proton's energy increases. The energy gained per revolution is approximately e * U0, but I'm not sure about the exact factor.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total number of revolutions is given by the ratio of the kinetic energy to the energy gained per revolution. But how much is that?

The kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Each revolution gains e*U0 volts. Since U0 is 190 kV, each revolution adds 190 keV.

So N = 950e3 keV / 190 keV/rev = 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000 rev.

But that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. So perhaps the factor is 2.

So, 950e3 / (2 * 190e3) = 950/380 ≈ 2.5, which is 2.5e3, 2500. So that's option D.

But why the factor of 2?

Because each revolution involves two applications of the voltage, each giving eU0. So each revolution adds 2eU0. Let me see: 2 *190e3 =380e3 eV per revolution.

950e6 eV / 380e3 eV/rev ≈ 2500.

Yes, that makes sense. So option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total energy required. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The alternating voltage applied is \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), with \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy as it passes through the accelerating gaps. Each full revolution corresponds to two acceleration events, where the proton gains energy \(eU_0\) at each gap. Thus, the energy gained per revolution is approximately \(2eU_0\). Converting \(U_0\) to eV, we have:

\[
U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{V}.
\]

The energy gained per revolution is therefore:

\[
\Delta E = 2eU_0 = 2 \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \times (190 \times 10^3 \, \text{V}) = 6.08 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}.
\]

The total energy required is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\), which in joules is:

\[
T_1 = 950 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}) = 1.5219 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}.
\]

The number of revolutions \(N\) is the total energy divided by the energy gained per revolution:

\[
N = \frac{T_1}{\Delta E} = \frac{1.5219 \times 10^{-11}}{6.08 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 2500.
\]

Thus, the proton makes approximately 2500 revolutions in the synchrocyclotron. This corresponds to option D.
