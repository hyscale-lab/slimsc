Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR characteristics. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3.

I remember that when a diacid dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The structure probably has two carboxylic acid groups connected by an oxygen bridge. Since the starting diacid has a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride where the two carboxylic groups are adjacent, maybe in a cyclic structure. Wait, but the product is an anhydride, so it's like two carboxylic acids losing water to form an oxygen bridge between them.

The NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests a symmetrical structure, possibly a cyclic anhydride where the protons are equivalent. So the anhydride could be something like cyclopentane dicarboxylic anhydride, which has a five-membered ring. But wait, the H NMR has a single peak, so maybe it's a more symmetrical structure. Alternatively, it could be a symmetric anhydride like succinic anhydride, but that's linear. Wait, succinic anhydride is cyclic, right? It's a five-membered ring. So in succinic anhydride, the protons are in equivalent positions, hence a singlet. So that might fit the 1H NMR.

Then the 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about typical carbon shifts. The carbonyl carbons in anhydrides usually show up around 165-185 ppm. The 137 ppm might be a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe a CH2 group or something. But wait, in succinic anhydride, the carbons adjacent to the oxygen (the bridge) are CH2, and the carbonyls are around 180s. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride isn't succinic. Let me think—maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with a substituent. No, wait, the NMR shows only two peaks. The 13C has two, so maybe all the carbons are of two types. That would suggest a very symmetrical structure. So maybe the anhydride is a symmetrical, cyclic structure like a five-membered ring, where all the non-anhydride carbons are same. So if the anhydride is formed from a diacid with a cis-alkene, perhaps the structure is such that the two carbonyl groups are adjacent in a ring.

Wait, but the starting material is a diacid, which when dehydrated forms an anhydride. So, for example, if the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, the anhydride would be cyclic. But wait, the diacid in the problem has a cis-alkene. So the structure before dehydration is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, the diacid has a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond—wait, that wouldn't make sense. Maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a CH2-CH2 replaced by a CH-CH with a cis configuration. Hmm, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the diacid has a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in between. Oh wait, no, the diacid can't have a double bond between the two COOH groups because then it would be a substituted maleic or fumaric acid. Alternatively, maybe the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a saturated diacid, not with a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the middle part is a cis double bond. Oh, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH—no, that's not a double bond. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the middle CH2-CH2 is a CH-CH, with a cis configuration. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH where the middle is a double bond. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the diacid could be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond, as in HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the two CH2 groups are actually CH with a double bond between them. So something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes HOOC-CH=CH-COOH in the cis configuration.

Wait, maybe that's the correct structure. So the diacid is a cis-diacid, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. So when it dehydrates, the anhydride would form a ring. If the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, the anhydride would be a five-membered ring, like succinic anhydride. But if the diacid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (cis), then the anhydride would form a five-membered ring with a double bond.

Wait, that's right. So when a diacid with a cis double bond is dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride with a double bond in the ring. For example, maleic anhydride is formed from maleic acid, which is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the anhydride would have a structure where the two CO groups are connected by an oxygen bridge and a double bond.

So the structure of the anhydride is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm, which for maleic anhydride, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are usually deshielded and appear around 6-7 ppm. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the protons are trans, and they are equivalent, so they would give a singlet. So that fits the 1H NMR data with a single peak at 7 ppm.

Now the 13C NMR: maleic anhydride has two carbonyl carbons and the sp2 carbons. The carbonyls are around 170-185 ppm, and the double bond carbons around 125-140 ppm. In our case, the anhydride's 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. So the 165 is likely the carbonyls, and 137 is the double bond carbons. But wait, in maleic anhydride, each of the double bond carbons is attached to a carbonyl, so their shifts are similar and would each be a single peak. So in the 13C NMR, we have two types: the carbonyl carbons (each at ~165 ppm) and the double bond carbons (each at ~137 ppm). But wait, for maleic anhydride, the structure is O=C-O-C-(CH2)2-C=O, no, wait, that's not right. No, wait, maleic anhydride is cyclic. It's a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So the structure is a cyclic anhydride where two of the atoms are the oxygens, and the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to a carbonyl group.

In that case, the 13C NMR would show the carbonyl carbons at around 175-185 ppm and the double bond carbons (sp2) at around 125-140 ppm. So the 165 and 137 ppm match that. So the anhydride is probably maleic anhydride.

Next, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Wait, let me think about the structure of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. It's a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So the structure is a five-membered ring, with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions, and each of those double bond carbons has a methyl group. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, and the numbering is such that 1 and 3 are double bonds. So positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the structure is:

Positions 1: CH2-CH2 (but wait, in 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making two conjugated double bonds. But the compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So each of the four carbons (1, 2,3,4) has a methyl group. So that would make the structure:

- 1: CH2 (but wait, if it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, then the structure would have the double bonds as 1-2 and 3-4. So each of these four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The cyclopentadiene ring has five carbons. Positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. So, positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded, and positions 3 and 4 are double-bonded. So the ring alternates single and double bonds, with the double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. Then, each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached.

So the structure is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on each of the four carbons involved in the double bonds. That's a lot of substituents.

Now, when this reacts with the anhydride (maleic anhydride), what kind of reaction is it? Oh, right, the Diels-Alder reaction. The diene (the cyclopentadiene) will react with the dienophile (the anhydride, which is a good dienophile) in a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, but wait, the dienophile is the anhydride. So the dienophile is the maleic anhydride, which is a good dienophile for Diels-Alder. So the cyclopentadiene (the diene) will attack the anhydride.

But wait, the diene here is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Wait, but in Diels-Alder, the diene is conjugated. So the diene might be in the s-cis conformation to react. Wait, but in this case, the diene is already a conjugated diene. So when it reacts with the dienophile, it forms a six-membered cycloadduct.

Wait, but the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with the diene (four carbons) adding to the dienophile (two carbons, usually with an electron-deficient double bond). The product would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps, but in this case, the diene is a substituted cyclopentadiene.

Wait, but the diene is a five-membered ring itself. So when it reacts, it would open up? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is part of the cyclopentadiene ring, so the Diels-Alder reaction adds the dienophile across the conjugated diene.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with four double bonds? No, no, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So 1,3-cyclopentadiene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group.

So when this diene (the cyclopentadiene) reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride), the Diels-Alder reaction occurs. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) has a double bond, and the diene (cyclopentadiene) has two conjugated double bonds. So the dienophile's double bond (the anhydride's) will react with the diene.

Wait, but the diene is part of a five-membered ring. So adding the dienophile across two of the double bonds might lead to a bicyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct forms a bicyclo structure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a ring-expansion or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the product structure. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) has the structure O=C-O-C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but that's not correct. Wait, maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with the structure O=C-(C-O)₂-C=O, but arranged in a ring with two double bonds. So the structure is a cyclic anhydride with two double bonds. The double bond is between the two carbons that are each attached to a carbonyl group.

When the Diels-Alder reaction occurs between the diene (cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride), the diene will add to the dienophile's double bond. The dienophile is electron-deficient because of the electron-withdrawing groups (the two carbonyls). So the diene (the cyclopentadiene) attacks the dienophile, forming a six-membered transition state, leading to the adduct.

The product will have a bicyclic structure, perhaps. But considering that the diene is part of a five-membered ring, the product might incorporate the dienophile into the ring, leading to a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure or something similar. Alternatively, the reaction could form a new six-membered ring fused to the existing five-membered ring.

But wait, perhaps it's better to think about the reaction in terms of the adduct. The Diels-Alder adduct will have the dienophile (maleic anhydride) adding across the diene's double bonds. So the diene, which is a conjugated diene, will form a six-membered ring with the dienophile, creating a bicyclic structure.

Wait, but the diene is tetramethyl, so it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So each of the four carbons in the conjugated diene has a methyl group.

Now, when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (positions 1-2 double bond and 3-4 double bond) will react, and the dienophile (maleic anhydride) will add across them. The endo rule suggests that the more substituted product is formed, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Once the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the product will have a six-membered ring fused to the five-membered ring, perhaps. The adduct will have the maleic anhydride's structure incorporated into the molecule.

But wait, the reaction between the diene and the dienophile yields two products: major and minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. The starting dienophile (maleic anhydride) is C4H2O3, and the diene is C9H12 (since 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene has five carbons in the ring plus four methyl groups: 5 + 4*1 = no, wait, the diene is C9H12. Let me check: cyclopentadiene is five carbons, each with a methyl group on four of them. So five carbons in the ring, each ring carbon has two substituents: the ring bonds and the methyl groups. Wait, no, each ring carbon has one methyl group, except perhaps the fifth carbon. So the formula is C9H12. The anhydride (maleic anhydride) is C4H2O3. So when they react, the product would be C9 + C4 = C13, and H: 12 + 2 = 14, but considering the Diels-Alder forms two new sigma bonds, so removing two H from the diene and none from the dienophile. Wait, no, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with the diene and dienophile, so the product would have the combined atoms. The diene is five-membered with four methyl groups (so 5 + 4*1 = 9 carbons) plus the dienophile's four carbons (from maleic anhydride), so 9 + 4 = 13 carbons. Molecular formula: each diene (C9H12) and each dienophile (C4H2O3) would combine to C13H14O3, but the product is C13H16O3. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Its formula would be C9H12. The dienophile is maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3. So combining them via Diels-Alder, which is a [4+2] reaction, so the product would have C9 + C4 = C13, and H: 12 (from diene) + 2 (from dienophile) - 4 (from the two double bonds forming two single bonds, so each double bond reduces H by 2, so 4 H lost) → 12+2=14 - 4=10 H. But then where are the oxygens? The dienophile has O3, so the product would have O3. But the problem states the product is C13H16O3. Hmm, that suggests that the product has 16 H. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds without losing H. Let me think: Diels-Alder forms two new sigma bonds, so the diene (4 pi electrons) and dienophile (2 pi electrons) combine into a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. So the formula would be:

Diene: C9H12 → 9 C, 12 H.

Dienophile: C4H2O3 → 4 C, 2 H, 3 O.

So product: 9+4=13 C, 12+2=14 H. But the product is C13H16O3. So that's 14+2=16 H. So where are the additional 2 H coming from? Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe during the reaction, some H are added elsewhere. Or perhaps I'm not considering the possibility of the dienophile being more complex.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So it's C9H12.

The dienophile is maleic anhydride, which is (C2H2O3) (since it's O=C-(C-O)2-C=O, but arranged in a ring, but the formula is C4H2O3? Wait, no. Let me calculate maleic anhydride. It has four carbons: two from each of the two carbonyl groups and two from the oxygen bridge. So the formula is C4H2O3.

So when they react, it's a [4+2] Diels-Alder. So the product would have 9+4=13 C, 12+2=14 H, plus 3 O. But the product has 16 H. So that suggests that the product has two more H than expected. Hmm, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct is not the only product. Or maybe the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder. Wait, but the problem states that the anhydride reacts with the diene to yield products, so probably Diels-Alder.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder but some other type of addition. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is adding in a way that introduces more H. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a cyclic anhydride with more H.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride we started with, which is maleic anhydride, C4H2O3. So when it reacts with the diene, the product should have 13 C, but the H would be 12 (diene) + 2 (dienophile) - 4 (two double bonds converted to single, each losing two H). So 12+2=14-4=10 H. But the product formula is C13H16O3. So that's 16 H. So I'm missing some H. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the diene's H.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let me count the H.

Cyclopentadiene has five carbons in the ring. Each of the four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So each of those four carbons has a CH2 group (since they're part of the ring and have a methyl substituent). Wait, no, in cyclopentadiene, each ring carbon is CH. Because the ring has five carbons, each bonded to two adjacent carbons and a double bond. Wait, no, for 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached.

So each of those four carbons is CH2 (since they're part of the ring and have a double bond, so they're CH groups in the ring, plus a methyl group, making each a CH(CH3)).

Wait, so the structure is:

Positions 1: CH(CH3)
Position 2: CH(CH3)
Position 3: CH(CH3)
Position 4: CH(CH3)
Position 5: CH2 (since it's a cyclopentane ring, but wait, position 5 is between 4 and 1. So position 5 is a single bond. So it's a cyclopentane ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, and each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group.

So each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) is CH(CH3). Position 5 is CH2.

So the formula of the diene: each CH(CH3) contributes 2 H (since each has a CH group plus a methyl). Wait, no, each CH(CH3) would have two H attached to the CH: for example, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with double bonds and substituents. Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the molecular formula.

Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) is CH(CH3), so each contributes 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) = 4 H. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has two H attached to the central C. Oh wait, no, CH(CH3) has two H and one CH3. So each CH(CH3) contributes 2 H per carbon.

There are four such carbons: 4 * 2 = 8 H. Position 5 is CH2, so that's 2 H. So total H from the ring: 8 + 2 = 10 H.

Plus the four methyl groups (each CH3 has 3 H): 4 * 3 = 12 H.

So total H is 10 + 12 = 22 H. Wait, but that can't be right because the formula would be C9H22, but the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has a molecular formula of C9H12. Hmm, so maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is a cumulene or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the molecular formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The parent structure is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has the formula C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) adds four C and 12 H. So the formula becomes C5+4=9 C, H6 +12=18 H. But the problem states that the product has formula C13H16O3. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C9H12. The dienophile is C4H2O3.

So the Diels-Alder product should have 9+4=13 C, and H: 12 (diene) + 2 (dienophile) - 4 (from the two new bonds) = 10 H. But the product is C13H16O3, which is 16 H, not 10. This suggests that my approach is wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is reacting in a different way.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride could be undergoing a ring-opening reaction. Anhydrides can react with dienes in a way that opens the anhydride ring and forms a new structure. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, which would form a six-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, but the product has molecular formula C13H16O3. Let me compute the possible structure.

The diene is C9H12, dienophile is C4H2O3. So product is C13H14O3. But the product is C13H16O3. So how does that happen? Maybe the reaction is not a Diels-Alder but a different addition. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is adding to the diene in a way that adds two H.

Hmm, perhaps the Diels-Alder forms a bicyclic structure where some H are added. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a Diels-Alder but a [2+4] addition, but that's the same as Diels-Alder. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different pericyclic reaction.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride isn't the dienophile but instead is reacting as an electrophilic component. Alternatively, the diene could be acting as a diene in a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is undergoing a ring-opening with the diene, leading to a different product.

Wait, another thought: the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm, which we determined is likely the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in maleic anhydride. So the anhydride is symmetric, so when it reacts, it would form products that have some symmetry.

When the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the endo rule suggests that the most substituted product is the major product. But the question mentions that two products are formed, major and minor.

But wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via Diels-Alder but via some other mechanism, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is first converted into a dienophile, and the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is the diene. So the reaction is Diels-Alder between the two, forming a bicyclic structure.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state is favored, so the major product would be the endo adduct, and the minor would be the exo. But perhaps in this case, the regiochemistry leads to two different products because of the symmetry of the dienophile or diene.

Alternatively, the diene's substituents could lead to different regioisomers.

But perhaps the main point is that the major and minor products differ in the stereochemistry of some groups, leading to different NOESY spectra.

The question states that the NOESY spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the major but not in the minor.

In NOESY, cross-peaks indicate spatial proximity between protons. So if two protons are near each other in space, even if not coupled, they'll show a cross-peak.

In the major product, which is likely the endo adduct, certain protons are close in space, leading to a cross-peak. In the minor product (exo), those protons are further apart, so no cross-peak.

So the cross-peak in the major product connects two protons that are close in space.

Now, looking at the options, the question is asking which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product.

The options are:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm

B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm

D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

We need to figure out which two protons are close in the major product.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule positions the substituents on the dienophile (the anhydride) on the same face as the diene's substituents. So in the endo product, the substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the diene's substituents, leading to certain spatial arrangements.

In the major product (endo), perhaps the substituents from the dienophile (like the methyl groups from the diene) are positioned close to each other, leading to a cross-peak in NOESY.

Alternatively, in the adduct, there might be axial and equatorial protons. The cross-peak would come from protons that are on adjacent carbons and are close in space.

Wait, but the options are about integrating from the 1H NMR. So let's think about the structure.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the diene (the tetramethyl groups) would be in specific positions. The product would have the two new bonds formed from the diene and dienophile.

The product would have a bicyclic structure, perhaps with the dienophile's oxygen atoms in a bridge position.

But perhaps it's better to think about the structure of the adduct. The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring, with the diene contributing four carbons and the dienophile two. In this case, the dienophile is maleic anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups. So the adduct would have an oxygen bridge and two ketone groups.

Wait, no, the maleic anhydride contributes two carbons to the new six-membered ring, each attached to a carbonyl group. So the adduct would have two ketone groups (or ester groups, but in the anhydride form) attached to the new ring.

So the structure would have a six-membered ring with two ester groups attached. The diene's substituents (the methyl groups) would be part of the bicyclic structure.

In the endo transition state, the substituents are positioned on the same face, so in the product, the methyl groups from the diene (which are on the same face) are close to the substituents from the dienophile (the oxygen atoms or the carbonyl groups).

But wait, the dienophile is an anhydride, so it's a cyclic structure. When it reacts, the two carbonyl groups become substituents on the new six-membered ring.

So in the major product (endo), the substituents from the dienophile (the carbonyl groups) would be on the same side as the substituents from the diene. This would bring certain protons into proximity.

Now, looking at the options, the cross-peak connects two resonances.

Looking at option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. A 6H singlet suggests six equivalent protons, likely from three methyl groups or something similar. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be from an oxygen-bearing CH2 group.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, perhaps some methyl groups are in equivalent positions, giving a singlet. The 6H could be from three methyl groups that are equivalent. The 2H at 3.5 ppm could be from the oxygen-connected CH2 groups.

Alternatively, option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. That suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 1H doublet may be from a CH group near another CH group, and the 2H singlet could be an oxygenated CH2.

But the question is which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak. The cross-peak arises when two protons are spatially close.

In the major product, the endo adduct, certain groups are on the same face, leading to proximity between specific protons.

So, perhaps in the major product, a proton from a methyl group is near a proton from an oxygen-bearing group.

Looking at option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (maybe three methyl groups) and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (an oxygenated CH2). If the 6H singlet is from methyl groups attached to the same carbon as the 2H singlet, then the protons would be close.

Alternatively, in the major product, the endo arrangement would place the methyl groups near the oxygenated regions, leading to proximity between a methyl proton and a proton on the oxygenated CH2.

Wait, but how would that happen?

In the Diels-Alder product, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) are positioned on the same face as the diene's substituents. So the methyl groups from the diene are on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile.

So, perhaps in the adduct, the methyl groups are near the oxygens, leading their protons to be close to protons on the oxygen-bearing groups.

But the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm suggests two equivalent protons, likely on a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

So, for example, if there's a CH2-O group, the protons on that CH2 would be deshielded and appear around 3.5 ppm as a singlet.

If the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups (each with two H, but they are all equivalent), then those methyl protons would be near the CH2-O protons, leading to a cross-peak.

But wait, the cross-peak is between a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet. So the 6H singlet is six protons, perhaps from three methyl groups (each with two H, but all equivalent). If these methyl groups are adjacent to the CH2-O group, then their protons would be near.

So in the major product, the 6H singlet (from three equivalent methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (from CH2-O) would have protons that are close in space, causing a cross-peak in NOESY.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (CH2-O).

So the cross-peak connects these two, meaning the two sets of protons are near each other in space.

In the major product (endo), these groups are positioned such that the methyl protons are near the CH2-O protons. But in the minor product (exo), they are on opposite faces, so no cross-peak.

So this would make option B the correct answer.

The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride is identified as maleic anhydride, based on its NMR data: a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR (indicating equivalent protons) and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR (indicating sp2 carbons and carbonyl carbons, respectively). This anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, forming two products: a major (endo) and a minor (exo). Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic structure where the substituents from the diene and dienophile are positioned on the same face in the major (endo) product. In the major product, spatial proximity between certain protons leads to a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum. Specifically, the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (likely from three equivalent methyl groups) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (likely from a CH2 group attached to an oxygen atom) are spatially close in the major product, resulting in a cross-peak. In the minor (exo) product, these protons are on opposite faces, and no cross-peak is observed.

Option B correctly identifies the two resonances connected by the cross-peak in the major product: a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.
