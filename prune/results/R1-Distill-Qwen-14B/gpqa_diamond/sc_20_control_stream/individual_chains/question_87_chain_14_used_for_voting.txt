Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR data shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so I need to figure out what's going on here.

First, let's break down the information given. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, but wait, wait. It says it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is probably benzene. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. But the total carbon count is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add 2 carbons each, or one adds two and the other adds zero? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The ring is six-membered, so the substituents add up to 8 -6 = 2 carbons. Because the entire molecule has 8 carbons. So each substituent must be one carbon each, but wait, that would make two substituents each with one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons, and the other has zero? Wait, no, because substituents can't be zero. So perhaps one substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon) and the other is another group, but that would only add 1 carbon. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recount.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons total. The benzene ring has 6, so the substituents must account for 2. So each substituent has one carbon, but wait, that adds up to two. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group and the other has none? But that doesn't make sense for di-substitution. Hmm. Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is O=C- attached, and another substituent is something else. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl, which is probably a ketone, aldehyde, or something like that. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, I. 

Wait, but the substituents need to add up to 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which is a substituent with zero carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group, but where's the carbon? Wait, a carbonyl group is a C=O. So that's one carbon. So the substituents would be a Cl (0 carbons) and a carbonyl group (1 carbon), which would add 1 carbon, but that's only 1, so total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (carbonyl) = 7, which is not 8. Hmm. That can't be right. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach. The substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), which is a single carbon, and the other substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon), making a total of 2. So the molecule would have a benzene ring with a ketone (like a propanone group?) and a methyl group. Wait, but where would the carbonyl be in the substituents? Or maybe the substituent is an acyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aldehyde group (CHO), which is a carbonyl group, so that adds one carbon. So the substituents would be CHO and Cl, for example. Then, the ring would have 6 carbons, substituents CHO (1 carbon) and Cl (no carbons), so total 7. But the problem says 8. So that's not matching. Hmm. Maybe the substituents are larger.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a longer chain. Let me think. Suppose one substituent is a carbonyl group, like -CO-R. If R is a methyl group, then that substituent would have two carbons (the carbonyl C and the methyl C), making the total substituent adding 2 carbons. So, if the other substituent is a halogen, then substituents would be -COCH3 and -X (where X is Cl, Br, etc.), adding two carbons (from the COCH3). So the ring has 6 carbons, substituents add 2, making 8. That seems to fit.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl (-COCH3, like an acetyl group), and the other is a halogen atom (like Cl or Br). So the molecule is di-substituted, with substituents at two positions on the benzene ring.

Now, thinking about the NMR. The carbonyl would be a ketone, so in the NMR, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. But wait, the carbonyl itself doesn't show up in the 1H NMR because it's a C=O. The protons next to it would be a triplet or something else, but maybe in this case, let's think about the substituents.

The substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the benzene ring has two substituents: Cl and COCH3. The di-substituted benzene would have a certain pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR.

But wait, let's think about the substitution pattern. If the benzene is di-substituted, the substituents could be in a para, meta, or ortho positions. The NMR would reflect that.

If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would typically be two doublets, each integrating to two protons, perhaps with a certain coupling. For example, in para-substituted rings, the H's are two doublets. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the splitting could be more complex, but with an aromatic ring and two substituents, the protons would be in two sets.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are a Cl (which is de-shielding) and a COCH3 (which is also a de-shielding group). So the ring's protons adjacent to these substituents would be deshielded and appear downfield.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

So, looking for aromatic protons. Let's start with the aromatic region in each option.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That's a singlet, two doublets. Wait, 1H singlet suggests perhaps an aldehyde proton, but the presence of a carbonyl group (like ketone) wouldn't have an aldehyde proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton that's not split, perhaps in an aromatic position where it's equivalent to others. Or perhaps it's part of a substituent.

Option C: 7.8 and 7.6 as doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-substituted ring, perhaps. Because in para substitution, the aromatic protons are typically two doublets. But the substituents would affect their shifts.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents, the substituents might be opposite each other, so the four aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets. But wait, wait, in a di-substituted benzene with two substituents, if they are para, you have two sets of two equivalent protons each. So for example, with Cl and COCH3 in para positions, the ring would have four H's, split into two sets. So the NMR would show two doublets.

Looking at option A: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that's four aromatic H's, each in a doublet. That could fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps.

Wait, but what about option C? It has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The singlet at 2.3 ppm is probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a carbonyl. Like in an acetyl group (COCH3), the methyl would be around 2.1-2.3 ppm. So 2.3 ppm with 3H as a singlet suggests a COCH3 group.

So in option C, the aromatic protons are a doublet at 7.8 and another at 7.6. That suggests para substitution with the substituents as strong electron-withdrawing groups, because the protons are downfield. So the substituents would be something like Cl (a strong EWG) and COCH3 (another EWG), making the ring protons highly deshielded.

Wait, but wait, the IR has peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3, which are both EWGs. So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in the downfield region.

Looking at option A: The aromatic H's are at 7.8 and 7.6, which is a bit upfield compared to option C. But in para substitution, the H's are typically more deshielded than in meta or ortho. Wait, but substituents can have varying effects. COCH3 is a strong EWG which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield.

So in option C, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6, which might be for a para-substituted structure with two EWGs. But wait, if the substituents are para, then the H's would be in two doublets, each integrating to two H's.

Wait, but also, the substituents would affect the number of H's. Let me think about the structure. If the benzene ring is 1,4-disubstituted (para), the two substituents would be at opposite ends. So the ring would have four H's in two pairs. The substituents would be Cl and COCH3. So the aromatic H's would be at the 2,3,5,6 positions? No, wait, 1 and 4 positions are substituents. So the H's would be at 2,3,5,6. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the H's are in positions 2,3,5,6 if substituents are at 1 and 4.

Wait, in that case, the H's at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent 1 (Cl), and the H's at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent 4 (COCH3). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. Let's say substituent Cl is at position 1, and substituent COCH3 is at position 4. Then, the H's at 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl, and the H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3.

But wait, Cl is a strong EWG which would de-shield the adjacent H's, making them appear downfield. COCH3 is also an EWG, so the adjacent H's would also be downfield. So the H's adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield than those adjacent to COCH3.

Wait, but in a para substitution, the H's are in two sets: two H's as one doublet, and two as another. But if substituents are different, the H's adjacent to each substituent would have different shifts.

So in option C, the aromatic H's are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So one pair is at 7.8, the other at 7.6. If the substituent adjacent to the 7.8 H's is Cl (stronger EWG), which would cause their H's to be more downfield than the H's adjacent to COCH3. 

Wait, COCH3 is a stronger EWG than Cl? Or is it the other way around? I think the carbonyl group is a stronger EWG than Cl. So the H's adjacent to COCH3 would be more downfield than those next to Cl.

Wait no, actually Cl is a stronger EWG than a ketone. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The strength of EWGs is typically measured by how much they de-shield the ring. For example, nitro groups are stronger than carbonyl groups, which are stronger than Cl. Wait, no, wait. Let me recall the order of deactivating groups. The order is typically: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR (like COCH3) > -SO3H > -X (halogens like Cl).

So Cl is a weaker deactivating group than COCH3. So the H's adjacent to COCH3 would be more downfield than those adjacent to Cl.

Wait, but in that case, in the para-substituted benzene with substituents Cl and COCH3, the H's adjacent to COCH3 would be more downfield than those adjacent to Cl. So the H's next to COCH3 would be at higher ppm (more downfield) than those next to Cl.

But in option C, the H's are 7.8 and 7.6. So the H's at 7.8 ppm would be more downfield. So if COCH3 is causing more downfield shift, then those would be the H's next to COCH3. But wait, wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the H's adjacent to each substituent are each in positions that are across from each other.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR signals. So in option C, the aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 7.8 (2H, d) and another at 7.6 (2H, d). Additionally, there's a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H, which would be the methyl of the COCH3 group.

So that makes sense. The COCH3 would be attached to the ring, giving a singlet for the methyl. The aromatic H's are split into two doublets, each with two H's, which fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, but what about the other substituent. The other substituent is Cl, so where would it be located? If the substituents are para, then the Cl would be opposite the COCH3. So the aromatic H's adjacent to Cl would be in positions that are more influenced by Cl, which is a weaker EWG than COCH3. So their chemical shifts would be less downfield than the H's adjacent to COCH3.

Wait, but the chemical shifts in option C are 7.8 and 7.6. So the higher ppm (7.8) would be the H's next to the stronger EWG (COCH3), and 7.6 would be next to Cl. That makes sense.

So that would fit option C. But wait, looking back at the options, option C is:

C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

So, that would be the aromatic H's, and the COCH3 methyl.

Now, what about the IR? The IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) is confirmed, which would be the COCH3 group. The aromatic-halogen peak suggests that there's a halogen attached to the ring, which would be the Cl.

So, putting it all together, the structure is benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups in para positions. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the COCH3's methyl as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Wait, but what about the substituents' positions? Could the substituents be in any other positions? For example, meta substitution.

Wait, in meta substitution, the substituents are at positions 1 and 3. The H's would then be in a different arrangement. The number of signals might be more, perhaps a triplet or more, but for di-substituted benzene in meta, the H's might split into a triplet and a doublet, or something else. But I'm not entirely sure. However, in ortho substitution, the substituents are adjacent, and the H's would be more complex.

But in the options, only option C has the aromatic protons as two doublets, which is consistent with para substitution.

Wait, what about option A? It has a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That's a very downfield shift. What kind of proton would that be? Aldehydic protons are around 9-10 ppm. So if there was an aldehyde group, there would be a singlet around 9.9 ppm. But in this case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3 (a ketone group), so no aldehyde. So option A's singlet may not fit.

So option C seems more likely.

Wait, but let me think again about the substituents. The total carbons in the molecule are 8. Benzene has 6, substituents add 2. So substituents are Cl (0 carbons) and COCH3 (which is 2 carbons: the CO has one, CH3 has another). Wait, COCH3 is a substituent with two carbons (the carbonyl group is C=O, so the substituent is O=C-CH3, which adds two carbons: the carbonyl C and the methyl C). So that makes substituents contributing two carbons, plus benzene's 6, totaling 8.

Yes, that makes sense. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the NMR in option C would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (from para substitution), the COCH3's methyl as a singlet, and that's all.

Wait, but in option C, the NMR only has three signals: two for the aromatic protons and one for the methyl. But the molecule is di-substituted. So there would be four aromatic protons, but in two sets of doublets. So this matches.

Wait, but in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, making the ring have two sets of equivalent H's. So the four aromatic H's would split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that's correct.

So the correct NMR should be option C.

But wait, option C has a 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H. That's the COCH3 group. So that fits.

But let's check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) — if that's an aldehyde proton, but we don't have an aldehyde here, so that's unlikely. Plus, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6. So that's possible, but without an aldehyde, this option is less likely.

Option B: no aromatic protons. It has 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s). That seems like a splitting typical of an ethylene group, perhaps in a cyclic structure, but no aromatic protons. So this can't be the case because the compound is aromatic.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 (1H, s) could be an aromatic proton, but that's only one H, which doesn't fit a di-substituted benzene. Plus, the other signals suggest something else, maybe an ethylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. So this doesn't fit.

So the correct option should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (likely Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). This makes the structure a para-substituted benzene with -Cl and -COCH₃ groups.

In the NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) will be deshielded and appear downfield. The para-substitution pattern results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each appearing as a doublet. The methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent will appear as a singlet at a chemical shift around 2.3 ppm due to its attachment to the carbonyl group.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. However, the compound does not contain an aldehyde group, making this option unlikely. Additionally, the aromatic protons at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm do not align with the expected splitting pattern for para-substitution.

2. **Option B**: Lacks any aromatic proton signals, which is inconsistent with the compound being an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: Shows two doublets for aromatic protons at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent. This matches the expected NMR pattern for the compound.

4. **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H), which does not fit the expected aromatic proton pattern for a di-substituted benzene. Additionally, the signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest an ethylene group, which is inconsistent with the compound's structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene with -Cl and -COCH₃ substituents, along with the singlet for the methyl group of the ketone.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR data shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so I need to figure out what's going on here.

First, let's break down the information given. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, but wait, wait. It says it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is probably benzene. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. But the total carbon count is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add 2 carbons each, or one adds two and the other adds zero? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The ring is six-membered, so the substituents add up to 8 -6 = 2 carbons. Because the entire molecule has 8 carbons. So each substituent must be one carbon each, but wait, that would make two substituents each with one carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons, and the other has zero? Wait, no, because substituents can't be zero. So perhaps one substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon) and the other is another group, but that would only add 1 carbon. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recount.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons total. The benzene ring has 6, so the substituents must account for 2. So each substituent has one carbon, but wait, that adds up to two. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group and the other has none? But that doesn't make sense for di-substitution. Hmm. Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is O=C- attached, and another substituent is something else. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl, which is probably a ketone, aldehyde, or something like that. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, I. 

Wait, but the substituents need to add up to 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which is a substituent with zero carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group, but where's the carbon? Wait, a carbonyl group is a C=O. So that's one carbon. So the substituents would be a Cl (0 carbons) and a carbonyl group (1 carbon), which would add 1 carbon, but that's only 1, so total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (carbonyl) = 7, which is not 8. Hmm. That can't be right. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach. The substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), which is a single carbon, and the other substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon), making a total of 2. So the molecule would have a benzene ring with a ketone (like a propanone group?) and a methyl group. Wait, but where would the carbonyl be in the substituents? Or maybe the substituent is an acyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aldehyde group (CHO), which is a carbonyl group, so that adds one carbon. So the substituents would be CHO and Cl, for example. Then, the ring would have 6 carbons, substituents CHO (1 carbon) and Cl (no carbons), so total 7. But the problem says 8. So that's not matching. Hmm. Maybe the substituents are larger.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a longer chain. Let me think. Suppose one substituent is a carbonyl group, like -CO-R. If R is a methyl group, then that substituent would have two carbons (the carbonyl C and the methyl C), making the total substituent adding 2 carbons. So, if the other substituent is a halogen, then substituents would be -COCH3 and -X (where X is Cl, Br, etc.), adding two carbons (from the COCH3). So the ring has 6 carbons, substituents add 2, making 8. That seems to fit.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl (-COCH3, like an acetyl group), and the other is a halogen atom (like Cl or Br). So the molecule is di-substituted, with substituents at two positions on the benzene ring.

Now, thinking about the NMR. The carbonyl would be a ketone, so in the NMR, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. But wait, the carbonyl itself doesn't show up in the 1H NMR because it's a C=O. The protons next to it would be a triplet or something else, but maybe in this case, let's think about the substituents.

The substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the benzene ring has two substituents: Cl and COCH3. The di-substituted benzene would have a certain pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR.

But wait, let's think about the substitution pattern. If the benzene is di-substituted, the substituents could be in a para, meta, or ortho positions. The NMR would reflect that.

If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would typically be two doublets, each integrating to two protons, perhaps with a certain coupling. For example, in para-substituted rings, the H's are two doublets. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the splitting could be more complex, but with an aromatic ring and two substituents, the protons would be in two sets.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are a Cl (which is de-shielding) and a COCH3 (which is also a de-shielding group). So the ring's protons adjacent to these substituents would be deshielded and appear downfield.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)
Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)
Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

So, looking for aromatic protons. Let's start with the aromatic region in each option.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That's a singlet, two doublets. Wait, 1H singlet suggests perhaps an aldehyde proton, but the presence of a carbonyl group (like ketone) wouldn't have an aldehyde proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton that's not split, perhaps in an aromatic position where it's equivalent to others. Or perhaps it's part of a substituent.

Option C: 7.8 and 7.6 as doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-substituted ring, perhaps. Because in para substitution, the aromatic protons are typically two doublets. But the substituents would affect their shifts.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents, the substituents might be opposite each other, so the four aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets. But wait, wait, in a di-substituted benzene with two substituents, if they are para, you have two sets of two equivalent protons each. So for example, with Cl and COCH3 in para positions, the ring would have four H's, split into two sets. So the NMR would show two doublets.

Looking at option A: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that's four aromatic H's, each in a doublet. That could fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps.

Wait, but what about option C? It has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The singlet at 2.3 ppm is probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a carbonyl. Like in an acetyl group (COCH3), the methyl would be around 2.1-2.3 ppm. So 2.3 ppm with 3H as a singlet suggests a COCH3 group.

So in option C, the aromatic protons are a doublet at 7.8 and another at 7.6. That suggests para substitution with the substituents as strong electron-withdrawing groups, because the protons are downfield. So the substituents would be something like Cl (a strong EWG) and COCH3 (another EWG), making the ring protons highly deshielded.

Wait, but wait, the IR has peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3, which are both EWGs. So in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in the downfield region.

Looking at option A: The aromatic H's are at 7.8 and 7.6, which is a bit upfield compared to option C. But in para substitution, the H's are typically more deshielded than in meta or ortho. Wait, but substituents can have varying effects. COCH3 is a strong EWG which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield.

So in option C, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6, which might be for a para-substituted structure with two EWGs. But wait, if the substituents are para, then the H's would be in two doublets, each integrating to two H's.

Wait, but also, the substituents would affect the number of H's. Let me think about the structure. If the benzene ring is 1,4-disubstituted (para), the two substituents would be at opposite ends. So the ring would have four H's in two pairs. The substituents would be Cl and COCH3. So the aromatic H's would be at the 2,3,5,6 positions? No, wait, 1 and 4 positions are substituents. So the H's would be at 2,3,5,6. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the H's are in positions 2,3,5,6 if substituents are at 1 and 4.

Wait, in that case, the H's at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent 1 (Cl), and the H's at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent 4 (COCH3). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. Let's say substituent Cl is at position 1, and substituent COCH3 is at position 4. Then, the H's at 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl, and the H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3.

But wait, Cl is a strong EWG which would de-shield the adjacent H's, making them appear downfield. COCH3 is also an EWG, so the adjacent H's would also be downfield. So the H's adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield than those adjacent to COCH3.

Wait, but in a para substitution, the H's are in two sets: two H's as one doublet, and two as another. But if substituents are different, the H's adjacent to each substituent would have different shifts.

So in option C, the aromatic H's are 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So one pair is at 7.8, the other at 7.6. If the substituent adjacent to the 7.8 H's is Cl (stronger EWG), which would cause their H's to be more downfield than the H's adjacent to COCH3. 

Wait, COCH3 is a stronger EWG than Cl? Or is it the other way around? I think the carbonyl group is a stronger EWG than Cl. So the H's adjacent to COCH3 would be more downfield than those next to Cl.

Wait no, actually Cl is a stronger EWG than a ketone. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The strength of EWGs is typically measured by how much they de-shield the ring. For example, nitro groups are stronger than carbonyl groups, which are stronger than Cl. Wait, no, wait. Let me recall the order of deactivating groups. The order is typically: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR (like COCH3) > -SO3H > -X (halogens like Cl).

So Cl is a weaker deactivating group than COCH3. So the H's adjacent to COCH3 would be more downfield than those adjacent to Cl.

Wait, but in that case, in the para-substituted benzene with substituents Cl and COCH3, the H's adjacent to COCH3 would be more downfield than those adjacent to Cl. So the H's next to COCH3 would be at higher ppm (more downfield) than those next to Cl.

But in option C, the H's are 7.8 and 7.6. So the H's at 7.8 ppm would be more downfield. So if COCH3 is causing more downfield shift, then those would be the H's next to COCH3. But wait, wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the H's adjacent to each substituent are each in positions that are across from each other.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR signals. So in option C, the aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 7.8 (2H, d) and another at 7.6 (2H, d). Additionally, there's a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H, which would be the methyl of the COCH3 group.

So that makes sense. The COCH3 would be attached to the ring, giving a singlet for the methyl. The aromatic H's are split into two doublets, each with two H's, which fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, but what about the other substituent. The other substituent is Cl, so where would it be located? If the substituents are para, then the Cl would be opposite the COCH3. So the aromatic H's adjacent to Cl would be in positions that are more influenced by Cl, which is a weaker EWG than COCH3. So their chemical shifts would be less downfield than the H's adjacent to COCH3.

Wait, but the chemical shifts in option C are 7.8 and 7.6. So the higher ppm (7.8) would be the H's next to the stronger EWG (COCH3), and 7.6 would be next to Cl. That makes sense.

So that would fit option C. But wait, looking back at the options, option C is:

C) 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

So, that would be the aromatic H's, and the COCH3 methyl.

Now, what about the IR? The IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) is confirmed, which would be the COCH3 group. The aromatic-halogen peak suggests that there's a halogen attached to the ring, which would be the Cl.

So, putting it all together, the structure is benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups in para positions. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, and the COCH3's methyl as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Wait, but what about the substituents' positions? Could the substituents be in any other positions? For example, meta substitution.

Wait, in meta substitution, the substituents are at positions 1 and 3. The H's would then be in a different arrangement. The number of signals might be more, perhaps a triplet or more, but for di-substituted benzene in meta, the H's might split into a triplet and a doublet, or something else. But I'm not entirely sure. However, in ortho substitution, the substituents are adjacent, and the H's would be more complex.

But in the options, only option C has the aromatic protons as two doublets, which is consistent with para substitution.

Wait, what about option A? It has a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That's a very downfield shift. What kind of proton would that be? Aldehydic protons are around 9-10 ppm. So if there was an aldehyde group, there would be a singlet around 9.9 ppm. But in this case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3 (a ketone group), so no aldehyde. So option A's singlet may not fit.

So option C seems more likely.

Wait, but let me think again about the substituents. The total carbons in the molecule are 8. Benzene has 6, substituents add 2. So substituents are Cl (0 carbons) and COCH3 (which is 2 carbons: the CO has one, CH3 has another). Wait, COCH3 is a substituent with two carbons (the carbonyl group is C=O, so the substituent is O=C-CH3, which adds two carbons: the carbonyl C and the methyl C). So that makes substituents contributing two carbons, plus benzene's 6, totaling 8.

Yes, that makes sense. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the NMR in option C would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (from para substitution), the COCH3's methyl as a singlet, and that's all.

Wait, but in option C, the NMR only has three signals: two for the aromatic protons and one for the methyl. But the molecule is di-substituted. So there would be four aromatic protons, but in two sets of doublets. So this matches.

Wait, but in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, making the ring have two sets of equivalent H's. So the four aromatic H's would split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that's correct.

So the correct NMR should be option C.

But wait, option C has a 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H. That's the COCH3 group. So that fits.

But let's check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) — if that's an aldehyde proton, but we don't have an aldehyde here, so that's unlikely. Plus, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6. So that's possible, but without an aldehyde, this option is less likely.

Option B: no aromatic protons. It has 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s). That seems like a splitting typical of an ethylene group, perhaps in a cyclic structure, but no aromatic protons. So this can't be the case because the compound is aromatic.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 (1H, s) could be an aromatic proton, but that's only one H, which doesn't fit a di-substituted benzene. Plus, the other signals suggest something else, maybe an ethylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. So this doesn't fit.

So the correct option should be C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (likely Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). This makes the structure a para-substituted benzene with -Cl and -COCH₃ groups.

In the NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) will be deshielded and appear downfield. The para-substitution pattern results in two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each appearing as a doublet. The methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent will appear as a singlet at a chemical shift around 2.3 ppm due to its attachment to the carbonyl group.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. However, the compound does not contain an aldehyde group, making this option unlikely. Additionally, the aromatic protons at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm do not align with the expected splitting pattern for para-substitution.

2. **Option B**: Lacks any aromatic proton signals, which is inconsistent with the compound being an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: Shows two doublets for aromatic protons at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent. This matches the expected NMR pattern for the compound.

4. **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H), which does not fit the expected aromatic proton pattern for a di-substituted benzene. Additionally, the signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest an ethylene group, which is inconsistent with the compound's structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene with -Cl and -COCH₃ substituents, along with the singlet for the methyl group of the ketone.
