Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

So, the question is about a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR spectra are given: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

The important part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, which means there's some spatial proximity between two protons. The minor doesn't have this cross-peak or it's very weak. So, the question is, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product's NMR?

Alright, let's start by figuring out the structure of the anhydride. The NMR data might help here.

The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably for an aromatic proton. Wait, but wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. So, perhaps the structure is something like a cyclic anhydride, maybe a maleic anhydride? Because maleic anhydride has a conjugated diene structure.

Wait, wait. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Let's say the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. Wait, no, that's not correct. A cis-alkene would mean that the double bond has substituents on the same side.

Wait, perhaps the acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH changing to HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. Wait, but that would make it a diacid with a double bond between the two CH groups. So, when it's dehydrated, the anhydride would form between the two carboxylic acid groups.

Alternatively, if the acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. Wait, maybe it's a substituted maleic acid. Like, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that doesn't have a double bond. So perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. Wait, that would make HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not correct. No, wait, the correct structure would be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the CH2 groups, which would make it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → but that can't form a double bond. Wait, maybe the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not right either. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, in the cis configuration, which is fumaric acid. If it's fumaric acid, when dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride. But wait, maleic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, right? So, its 1H NMR would show a singlet because all the protons are equivalent. Wait, but maleic anhydride has two sets of equivalent protons. Or maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, in maleic anhydride, the structure is cyclic, with two double bonds. The protons are in a conjugated system. But in its NMR, the protons are split into two sets. Wait, but the question says that the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests all the protons are equivalent, which would happen if they are in a symmetrical environment. So, maybe the anhydride is symmetric.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride is a cyclic structure where the two substituents are identical, making the protons equivalent. For example, if the starting acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but that's a trans or cis diol? No, wait, in the problem, the starting acid has a cis-alkene. So, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is fumaric acid (cis), but dehydration would form maleic anhydride. Wait, but maleic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. It has two sets of protons, but in a symmetrical arrangement.

Wait, actually, in maleic anhydride, the structure is a five-membered ring with two ester groups. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-(CH2CH2)-C-O
      ||       
      O

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Maleic anhydride is an anhydride of maleic acid, which is the cis isomer. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
     ||       
     O

Wait, no, the actual structure is a cyclic anhydride with two double bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH=CH-C-O
      ||       
      O

But that would mean that the two CH groups are each connected to the oxygen. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to visualize it as a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So, the structure is a cyclopentene ring with two ester groups. Thus, in the 1H NMR, the two equivalent protons on the double bond would give a singlet, but wait, maleic anhydride actually has two sets of protons. Let me check. Wait, no, in maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond are in a conjugated system and are trans to each other. So, in the 1H NMR, they would be split into two doublets, but perhaps they are not equivalent. Wait, but the question says the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So, the anhydride must have equivalent protons. That would happen if the structure is symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure where the two double bond protons are equivalent. So, maybe it's an annulene or something. Hmm, perhaps the anhydride is something like cyclopentene-based. Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a symmetric structure like 1,2-cyclopentene-dicarboxylic anhydride. In that case, the two protons on the double bond would be equivalent, giving a singlet in the 1H NMR. That would explain the single peak at 7 ppm. So, the structure is a cyclic anhydride with a symmetric structure, leading to a single proton peak.

Now, looking at the 13C NMR, the anhydride has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about the carbons. The 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl group or an sp2 carbon. The 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon. Wait, in maleic anhydride, the carbonyl carbons are around 185-190 ppm, perhaps? But here, the anhydride's 13C NMR has 137 and 165. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a beta-keto anhydride or something else.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is not maleic but another structure. Let me think again. The starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride. So, the structure would be something like O=C-O-C-O=C-, with the -O-C-O- part being the anhydride bridge. The rest would be the two carboxyl groups connected via a double bond.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a cyclic structure with two double bonds. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should move forward and think about the reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

So, the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to form two products. Both have the formula C13H16O3. Hmm, the molecular formula of the anhydride is probably C4H2O3 (since the starting dicarboxylic acid is C4H6O4, and dehydration loses a water, so becomes C4H4O3). But wait, when the anhydride reacts with the cyclopentadiene, which has the formula C9H12, the product would be C4 + C9 = C13, perhaps? But let's see: the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3.

Wait, the anhydride's formula: the starting acid is a dicarboxylic acid with four carbons (assuming it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. So, maybe it's HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a cis double bond, so HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H becomes HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that's not a double bond. Wait, the acid is a diene? So the acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → no, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that's a four-carbon diacid with a double bond. When it dehydrates, it would form a five-membered anhydride ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a four-carbon, but without a double bond. So perhaps the acid is a four-carbon diacid with a cis double bond. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH would be succinic acid, but without a double bond. So, the acid in question must have a cis-alkene, so perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. So, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in between, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The structure would then be a cyclic anhydride, which is maleic anhydride. Because fumaric acid (the trans isomer) would dehydrate to maleic anhydride, which is the cis isomer.

Wait, but wait. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, while maleic acid is the cis. So, if the starting acid is the cis (so, maleic acid), it would dehydrate to form maleic anhydride. So, the anhydride is maleic anhydride, which has a structure as a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond.

In the 1H NMR of maleic anhydride, the two protons on the double bond are trans and are equivalent due to the symmetry of the ring. So, their protons would be a singlet. That aligns with the single peak at 7 ppm in the question.

In the 13C NMR, the carbons would include the carbonyl carbons (around 165 ppm?), the oxygen-bearing carbons, and the carbons from the double bond. Let me think: in maleic anhydride, the carbonyl carbons are around 165 ppm (C=O), the adjacent carbons (the ones attached to oxygen) are around 135-140 ppm, perhaps. So, the two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm make sense. So, the anhydride is maleic anhydride.

So, now, the reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

What's the structure of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene? Its structure is a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So, the ring has five carbons, and four of them have methyl substituents. So, the structure is like:

CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, wait. 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, perhaps? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene as 1,3-diene. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene. But if it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, then each of those four carbons has a methyl group attached.

So, the structure would be:

CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2 ?

No, perhaps more accurately, it's a cyclopentadiene ring with methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. So, it's a five-membered ring with four methyl substituents. The structure would be:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

The ring is cyclopentadiene, so positions 1 and 3 have double bonds. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making the ring conjugated. So, the structure is:

Positions 1-2 double bond, and 3-4 double bond. Then, each of the carbons 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group. So, the structure is:

1: CH2 (but with a methyl? No, wait, the substituents are methyl on positions 1,2,3,4. So, each of those positions has a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps each of the carbons in positions 1,2,3,4 has a methyl substituent. So, the structure is:

Positions 1: CH(CH3)
Position 2: CH(CH3)
Position 3: CH(CH3)
Position 4: CH(CH3)
Position 5: CH2 (but wait, that might not be correct in a five-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopentene ring with four methyl groups attached.

But perhaps I should think about the reaction between maleic anhydride and this diene. The reaction is likely a Diels-Alder reaction. Because maleic anhydride is a good dienophile, and the cyclopentadiene is the diene.

The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile, forming a six-membered ring with two substituents (the endo rule might apply, but in this case, the substituents are the tetramethyl groups and the maleic anhydride part).

So, when the reaction occurs, the diene (cyclopentadiene) would attack the dienophile (maleic anhydride), forming a bicyclic structure. But wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, the Diels-Alder adduct would have a bicyclo structure, perhaps.

Wait, but the product would have the maleic anhydride part adding across the diene. The product would be a six-membered ring fused to the cyclopentane ring. Or perhaps a bicyclo structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is the maleic anhydride. The dienophile's structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. So, during the Diels-Alder, the diene (the cyclopentadiene) would attack the dienophile, adding four carbons from the diene and two from the dienophile.

Wait, but in this case, the dienophile is a cyclic anhydride, which would form a six-membered ring adduct. So, the product would have a bicyclic structure, perhaps with the anhydride's oxygen atoms incorporated into the ring.

But perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure with an oxygen bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a six-membered ring with substituents from the diene and the dienophile.

Wait, but the products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3. Let's think about the molecular formulas. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) is C4H2O3. The diene is C9H12 (since 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene has 5 carbons in the ring plus four methyl groups, so 5 + 4 = 9 carbons, and each methyl contributes 3 H, but let me count: the ring is cyclopentadiene (5 carbons), each of four positions has a methyl group. So, the formula is C9H12.

So, the reaction is between maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H12). The products would have molecular formula C4 + C9 = C13, and H: 2 + 12 =14, but the product is C13H16O3, which adds two more hydrogens and three oxygens. Wait, no, because the reaction is a Diels-Alder, which would form a six-membered ring via [4+2] addition, and possibly involves some oxygen.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the molecular formula. Maleic anhydride is C4H2O3. The diene is C9H12. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] addition, so the product would have C4 + C9 = C13, but wait, the diene is four carbons (the conjugated diene) and the dienophile is two carbons (the anhydride). So, the product would have C4 + C2 = C6, but that doesn't make sense since the diene is part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product combines the entire diene (C9H12) and the dienophile (C4H2O3). But wait, the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let me add the two: C4 + C9 = C13, H: 2 + 12 =14, O:3. But the product has H=16, so perhaps two H are added, possibly from the reaction conditions, like in the Diels-Alder, which is a concerted reaction without adding H or O. Wait, no, the Diels-Alder forms sigma bonds, so no H are added. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C9H12). So, the product would be C13H14O3. But the product has C13H16O3, which is two more hydrogens. Hmm, that suggests perhaps some ring-opening or other reactions, but I'm not sure. Maybe the reaction is not a Diels-Alder but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride could be undergoing a ring-opening reaction with the diene. Anhydrides can react with dienes in a ring-opening addition. For example, in a conjugate addition (Michael addition) or other mechanisms. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is a diene that can open the anhydride ring.

But perhaps the initial assumption was correct about the Diels-Alder. So, moving forward, perhaps the product is a Diels-Alder adduct, which would have the formula C4 (from anhydride) + C9 (dienophile? Wait, no, wait, the diene contributes four carbons to the adduct, and the dienophile contributes two. So, the adduct would have six carbons, but in this case, the diene is part of a larger molecule. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the maleic anhydride (dienophile) and the cyclopentadiene (diene), leading to a bicyclic structure. The major and minor products could arise from different stereochemical outcomes, such as endo vs exo addition, or different regiochemistry.

But the question is about the NOESY NMR, which is about the spatial proximity of protons. The presence of a cross-peak indicates that the two protons are close in space, i.e., they are on adjacent carbons or in a certain spatial arrangement.

In the major product, the cross-peak is present, so the protons are close. In the minor product, it's absent, suggesting a different spatial arrangement.

Looking at the options, the possible pairs are between a singlet and a doublet, or singlets, etc.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. So, a methyl group and a methylene proton.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. So, perhaps a methyl group and an oxygen-bearing CH2.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. Two different methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. Perhaps a methylene near another group.

But wait, the products have the formula C13H16O3. Let's think about what the protons might look like.

If the major product is a Diels-Alder adduct, the structure would have some new protons. The adduct would have six-membered ring with substituents.

But perhaps the reaction produces a bicyclic structure where some protons are in proximity.

Wait, another approach: the NOESY cross-peak connects two protons that are on adjacent carbons or in a spatial arrangement that brings them close, like axial-equatorial positions in a ring.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the bridgehead protons might be close. Alternatively, the substituents from the diene and dienophile could be in proximity.

Wait, considering the structure, after the Diels-Alder reaction, the maleic anhydride becomes part of a six-membered ring, and the diene (cyclopentadiene) contributes four carbons.

Wait, perhaps the product has two methyl groups that are close in space, or a methyl group and another substituent.

Alternatively, considering the original diene, which is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, the product would have four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentane ring, and the adduct would add the maleic anhydride part.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure of the adduct. Maybe I should think about the NOESY part.

In the major product, there's a cross-peak between two protons. Let's think which two groups would be close. For example, in a bicyclic structure, methyl groups on adjacent carbons would be close. Or perhaps a methyl group and an oxygenated proton.

Looking at the options, option B is 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. A 6H singlet suggests a set of equivalent protons, like three methyl groups (each with two H) or perhaps a single CH3 group with six H (but that's not possible; maybe three CH2 groups? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, 6H as a singlet would be three equivalent CH2 groups? Or perhaps two CH3 groups, each with 3 H, but that would be 6 H. Alternatively, a single CH3 group with 6 H? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps it's a 6H singlet, meaning six H in total, all in a singlet. So, maybe two CH3 groups (each 3 H) as a singlet. Or perhaps a single CH2 group with 2 H and another group, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, 6H singlet could be three different methyl groups, but that would not be a singlet. No, unless they're all equivalent. So, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three equivalent methyl groups, each contributing 2 H (but that's 6 H). Wait, no, each CH3 is 3 H. So, three CH3 groups would be 9 H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is a single CH2 group. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's not possible with H.

Wait, perhaps the 6H is a CH2 group with two H, but that would only be 2 H. No, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the 6H is a -C(CH3)2 group, which has 6 H from two CH3 groups. But that would be a singlet because the two CH3 groups are equivalent. So, in that case, the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm could be two methyl groups attached to a single carbon, giving a singlet. And the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm could be two equivalent protons, perhaps on an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an OCH2 group.

So, if the major product has a cross-peak between the 6H singlet and the 2H singlet, that suggests that the two protons are close in space. So, perhaps the two methyl groups (6H) are adjacent to the OCH2 group. So, the OCH2 would be attached to a carbon that's next to a carbon with two CH3 groups.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule would place substituents on the same face, which could bring the substituents closer. So, perhaps the methyl groups from the diene are close to the oxygen's substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the two CH3 groups are on adjacent carbons to the OCH2 group, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

So, looking at the options:

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

If the 2H singlet is an OCH2 group, and the 6H is two CH3 groups attached to the adjacent carbon, then they would be spatially close, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Alternatively, option D is a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. So, perhaps a CH group next to the OCH2.

But why would a cross-peak exist between those in the major product and not the minor?

Let me think about the endo and exo products. The endo rule states that the more substituted (endo) product is favored. In the endo transition state, the substituents are on the same face, so in the product, substituents from the dienophile (maleic anhydride) are close to the substituents on the diene.

So, in the endo product, the substituents from the dienophile (like the oxygen) would be close to the substituents (methyl groups) on the diene. So, in the product, the OCH2 group would be adjacent to the methyl groups, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

In the exo product, the substituents would be on opposite faces, so the proximity would be less, leading to no or a weak cross-peak.

So, the major product is the endo product, where the OCH2 is near the methyl groups.

So, in the NOESY, the cross-peak connects the OCH2 (2H singlet) and the methyl groups (6H singlet). So, looking for an option that has these two.

Option B is a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet. So, that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is the two CH3 groups, and the 2H is the OCH2.

So, the cross-peak in the major product connects these two, indicating they are close.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data suggests it is maleic anhydride, which has a single peak at 7 ppm in its 1H NMR spectrum (indicating equivalent protons on the double bond) and peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its 13C NMR spectrum (consistent with sp2 carbons and carbonyl carbons). Maleic anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, forming two products: a major product (endo) and a minor product (exo). Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The NOESY NMR spectra reveal that the major product has a cross-peak between two resonances, while the minor product does not. This indicates spatial proximity between two protons in the major product, likely due to the endo stereochemistry, where substituents from the dienophile (maleic anhydride) are close to substituents on the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial proximity in the major product.
- **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet likely corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H singlet corresponds to an OCH2 group. These two groups would be spatially close in the endo product, consistent with the cross-peak observed in the NOESY spectrum.
- **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two separate methyl groups, which are unlikely to be spatially close enough to produce a cross-peak.
- **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This combination does not match the expected spatial arrangement in the major product.

The major product's cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum is best explained by the proximity of the 6H singlet (two methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (OCH2 group), as described in Option B. This is consistent with the endo stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction.

**Answer: B**
