Okay, so I've got this problem here about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with observables and probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think that means it's a vector in a three-dimensional space. So the state vector is a column like [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized. The norm would be the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

Let me calculate that. (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding those up gives 1 + 4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Oh, right, but in quantum states, we usually have the vector be a unit vector, so maybe I need to normalize it. Or wait, is that necessary for this problem? Because when calculating probabilities, perhaps the actual state can be any non-zero vector, and the probabilities are computed accordingly. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed and see if it becomes an issue later.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. The problem gives the elements of P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So let me write that matrix out:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Wait, hmm, that's a symmetric matrix, which makes sense for an observable because observables should be Hermitian. I think that's correct.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. Okay, so in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are zero, then compute the probability of getting that outcome.

Wait, but what are the eigenvalues of P? Let me think about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 because the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component in that eigenvector.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors of P for the eigenvalue 0. Let me set up the equation (P - 0*I) v = 0. So solving P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0
Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) x + 0 y + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0
Row 3: 0 x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0 z = 0

So from row 1: (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 → y = 0.
From row 3: (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 → again y=0.
From row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) x + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x.

So the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form (x, 0, -x), which can be written as x*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1). Because the matrix P is 3x3, but the rank is such that the null space is one-dimensional.

But wait, how do I know if 0 is an eigenvalue? Because the determinant of P might be zero, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the rank of P is 2 (I can see that from the rows: rows 1 and 3 are [0, a, 0], and row 2 is [a, 0, a], so maybe rank 2 because rows 1 and 3 are linearly independent from row 2 if a isn't zero), so the nullity is 3 - 2 = 1, meaning the dimension of the eigenspace is 1. So yes, 0 is an eigenvalue.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1, 0, -1) up to scaling. Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in this eigenvector.

Wait, but the state vector is given as [-1; 2; 1]. Let me denote it as |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. So the amplitude is the inner product of |ψ> and the eigenvector |v> = [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but I should normalize |v> first because eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar multiple. Let's compute the norm of |v>: sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

Now, compute the inner product <v|ψ>. That is, (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 0, -1] multiplied by the column vector [-1, 2, 1]. So:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1 -0 -1) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, wait a second. The inner product is a scalar. The amplitude is this value. The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude.

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2), so the square is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But wait, wait, the magnitude squared is |amplitude|^2. So | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but the state vector |ψ> has a norm of sqrt(6), as I calculated earlier. So that's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized. Because the probabilities should sum to 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the given vector isn't normalized.

Ah, right! Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized. So the given state vector must be normalized. So perhaps the actual state is |ψ> divided by its norm. So |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1; 2; 1 ].

So when calculating the inner product, I should use this normalized state.

So let's recalculate the amplitude. The normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1; 2; 1].

The normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

Now the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) <v|ψ_normalized>.

Wait, no. The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] multiplied by (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So inner product = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) * [ 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ]

So that's (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) * ( -1 -1 ) = (1/sqrt(12)) ) * (-2) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Check if the state is normalized. Sum of squares is 1+4+1=6 → norm sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized, but in quantum mechanics, states must be normalized. So we have to normalize the state vector. So the state is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

2. The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The eigenvalue 0 has eigenvectors proportional to [1, 0, -1]^T, normalized to 1/sqrt(2).

3. The inner product between the normalized state and the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(6)) * ( -1, 2, 1 ) · (1/sqrt(2)) * (1, 0, -1 ).

Wait, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1], normalized to 1/sqrt(2). So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(6)) * (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (1/sqrt(6)) * 2 * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * 1 * ( -1/sqrt(2) )

= ( -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + ( -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3)

So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), and the probability is 1/3. So yes, correct.

To determine the probability of measuring 0 for the observable \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Identify the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0
The observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, we solve \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). This gives the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} z = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first and third equations, \( y = 0 \). From the second equation, \( x + z = 0 \), so \( z = -x \). Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing this eigenvector gives:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the amplitude
The amplitude of the state \( |\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle \) in the direction of \( |v\rangle \) is the inner product:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot \left( 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot (-2) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the probability
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude:

\[
P(0) = \left| \langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
