Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it. Hmm, a spin-half particle in a linear superposition... Right, spin-half particles can be either spin-up or spin-down, and those states are eigenstates of the sigma_z operator, which is the Pauli z-matrix.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, let me check if that's normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. So, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. Adding those gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1.0. Yep, that's good. So the state is properly normalized.

The question is about the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. Since the operator is a sum of σz and σx, each multiplied by a constant, I can compute the expectation for each part separately and then combine them.

So, let's break it down. The operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, I need to find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are straightforward. The state ψ is a linear combination of these eigenstates.

The expectation value of σz is given by the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So, the coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the particle is more likely to be in the |↓⟩ state, which is the -1 eigenvalue, so the expectation is negative.

Next, I need ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But in our case, the state is already expressed in terms of σz eigenstates. So, I can't directly use the same approach as σz here.

I think the way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to expand the expectation value in the given basis. So, ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Expressed in terms of the basis vectors, σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, when we apply σx to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩, and to |↓⟩, it becomes |↑⟩.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute it directly. Let me write out the state vectors.

In terms of vectors, |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So, the matrix representation is:

σx = [ [0, 1],
         [1, 0] ]

So, to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, let's compute it step by step.

First, compute σx |ψ⟩.

σx |ψ⟩ = σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) ]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, take the conjugate transpose of ψ (which is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*] since all coefficients are real here) and multiply by σx |ψ⟩.

So, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Breaking it down:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]

Which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

So each term is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) and (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5).

So both terms are (sqrt(3)/4), adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4)*2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that.

Wait, when you have a vector multiplied by another, each component is the product of the row and column.

So,

First component: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4.

Second component: sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = same as before, sqrt(3)/4.

Adding them: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach is to use the expectation formula in terms of the coefficients. Alternatively, since σx can be represented in terms of its own eigenstates, but I think the way I did it is correct.

So, putting it all together:

The operator's expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We found ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5 and ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.8660.

Calculating each term:

10 * (-0.5) = -5.

5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 * 0.8660 ≈4.330.

Adding these together: -5 +4.330 ≈-0.6699.

Wait, that's approximately -0.67.

Wait, but the options are: A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm, -0.67 is close to option C, which is -0.7.

Wait, but wait again. Did I make a calculation mistake?

Let me recheck the σx expectation value.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of σx can also be found using the formula:

⟨σx⟩ = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a*b* ), but wait no, that's for when the state is a|↑⟩ +b |↓⟩.

Wait, the general formula for ⟨σx⟩ is ( |b|^2 - |a|^2 ) + 2 Re(a b*) ?

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices in terms of the spin states.

Wait, when the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, then ⟨σx⟩ is:

( |b|^2 - |a|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b* )

Wait, let me calculate that.

Here, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 =0.25, |b|^2=3/4=0.75.

So |b|^2 - |a|^2 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5.

Then 2 Re( a b* ) is 2 Re( (0.5) (sqrt(3)/2) ) since both a and b are real. So Re is just the product.

So 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4 ≈0.4330. Multiply by 2 gives sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ = 0.5 +0.8660 ≈1.3660?

Wait, wait that can't be right because earlier calculation gave 0.866.

Wait, wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

⟨σx⟩ = (b a^* + a b^*) ), because σx is represented by the matrix [[0 1],[1 0]], so when you compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, it's a*(0) + b*(1)*a + a*(1)*b + b*(0). Wait, no.

Wait, let me recompute. Let me write |ψ⟩ as a column vector [a; b], where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ is [b; a].

So, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of [a; b] times [b; a].

Which is a*b + b*a.

Since a and b are real, this is a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So, ab = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4 ≈0.4330. So 2ab is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So that's correct.

So, I think my initial calculation was correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait, but the formula I thought of earlier gave a different result. Let me see where I went wrong.

Wait, the formula I thought of earlier was for another operator perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula for σx. Let me think again.

The correct expression is ⟨σx⟩ = 2ab, since a and b are real. So that gives 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So, that's correct.

So, putting it all together:

10⟨σz⟩ =10*(-0.5)= -5.

5⟨σx⟩=5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*0.8660 ≈4.330.

Adding them: -5 +4.330= -0.6699, which is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option C) -0.7.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660254.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.8660254 ≈4.330127.

So, 10*(-0.5) is -5.

Add: 4.330127 -5 = -0.669873 ≈-0.67.

So to one decimal place, that's -0.7. Because 0.669 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6 when rounded to one decimal. Wait, wait, -0.67 is about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. No, wait, -0.67 is between -0.7 and -0.6. But for one decimal place, we look at the second decimal digit. 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal because the second digit is 7, which is ≥5.

Wait, but wait: when you have -0.6699, to one decimal place, it's -0.7 because the next digit (6) is ≥5? No, wait, the number is -0.6699. The first decimal is 6, the second is 6. So, when rounding to one decimal, we look at the second decimal place. So -0.6699 is approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but for one decimal: 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal, because 0.6 is the first decimal, and the next digit is 6, which is ≥5, so you round up. So 0.67 ≈0.7 (when one decimal). So -0.67 would be approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait, but wait, the number is -0.6699. Let me think about it numerically.

-0.6699 is between -0.7 and -0.6. So when rounding to one decimal place, the first decimal is 6, the next is 6, so you round the 6 up to 7, making it -0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps the question allows for an approximate value. So the correct answer would be -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -1.4

B)1.65

C)-0.7

D)0.85

So option C is -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \) are \( 0.5 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), respectively. The probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are:

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the Pauli matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The state \( \psi \) can be written as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]

Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( \psi \):

\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated value is:

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it. Hmm, a spin-half particle in a linear superposition... Right, spin-half particles can be either spin-up or spin-down, and those states are eigenstates of the sigma_z operator, which is the Pauli z-matrix.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, let me check if that's normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. So, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. Adding those gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1.0. Yep, that's good. So the state is properly normalized.

The question is about the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. Since the operator is a sum of σz and σx, each multiplied by a constant, I can compute the expectation for each part separately and then combine them.

So, let's break it down. The operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, I need to find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are straightforward. The state ψ is a linear combination of these eigenstates.

The expectation value of σz is given by the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So, the coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the particle is more likely to be in the |↓⟩ state, which is the -1 eigenvalue, so the expectation is negative.

Next, I need ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But in our case, the state is already expressed in terms of σz eigenstates. So, I can't directly use the same approach as σz here.

I think the way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to expand the expectation value in the given basis. So, ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Expressed in terms of the basis vectors, σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, when we apply σx to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩, and to |↓⟩, it becomes |↑⟩.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute it directly. Let me write out the state vectors.

In terms of vectors, |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So, the matrix representation is:

σx = [ [0, 1],
         [1, 0] ]

So, to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, let's compute it step by step.

First, compute σx |ψ⟩.

σx |ψ⟩ = σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) ]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, take the conjugate transpose of ψ (which is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*] since all coefficients are real here) and multiply by σx |ψ⟩.

So, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Breaking it down:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]

Which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

So each term is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) and (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5).

So both terms are (sqrt(3)/4), adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4)*2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that.

Wait, when you have a vector multiplied by another, each component is the product of the row and column.

So,

First component: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4.

Second component: sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = same as before, sqrt(3)/4.

Adding them: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach is to use the expectation formula in terms of the coefficients. Alternatively, since σx can be represented in terms of its own eigenstates, but I think the way I did it is correct.

So, putting it all together:

The operator's expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We found ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5 and ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.8660.

Calculating each term:

10 * (-0.5) = -5.

5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 * 0.8660 ≈4.330.

Adding these together: -5 +4.330 ≈-0.6699.

Wait, that's approximately -0.67.

Wait, but the options are: A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm, -0.67 is close to option C, which is -0.7.

Wait, but wait again. Did I make a calculation mistake?

Let me recheck the σx expectation value.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of σx can also be found using the formula:

⟨σx⟩ = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a*b* ), but wait no, that's for when the state is a|↑⟩ +b |↓⟩.

Wait, the general formula for ⟨σx⟩ is ( |b|^2 - |a|^2 ) + 2 Re(a b*) ?

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices in terms of the spin states.

Wait, when the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, then ⟨σx⟩ is:

( |b|^2 - |a|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b* )

Wait, let me calculate that.

Here, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 =0.25, |b|^2=3/4=0.75.

So |b|^2 - |a|^2 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5.

Then 2 Re( a b* ) is 2 Re( (0.5) (sqrt(3)/2) ) since both a and b are real. So Re is just the product.

So 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4 ≈0.4330. Multiply by 2 gives sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ = 0.5 +0.8660 ≈1.3660?

Wait, wait that can't be right because earlier calculation gave 0.866.

Wait, wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

⟨σx⟩ = (b a^* + a b^*) ), because σx is represented by the matrix [[0 1],[1 0]], so when you compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, it's a*(0) + b*(1)*a + a*(1)*b + b*(0). Wait, no.

Wait, let me recompute. Let me write |ψ⟩ as a column vector [a; b], where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ is [b; a].

So, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of [a; b] times [b; a].

Which is a*b + b*a.

Since a and b are real, this is a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So, ab = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4 ≈0.4330. So 2ab is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So that's correct.

So, I think my initial calculation was correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait, but the formula I thought of earlier gave a different result. Let me see where I went wrong.

Wait, the formula I thought of earlier was for another operator perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula for σx. Let me think again.

The correct expression is ⟨σx⟩ = 2ab, since a and b are real. So that gives 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So, that's correct.

So, putting it all together:

10⟨σz⟩ =10*(-0.5)= -5.

5⟨σx⟩=5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*0.8660 ≈4.330.

Adding them: -5 +4.330= -0.6699, which is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option C) -0.7.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660254.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.8660254 ≈4.330127.

So, 10*(-0.5) is -5.

Add: 4.330127 -5 = -0.669873 ≈-0.67.

So to one decimal place, that's -0.7. Because 0.669 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6 when rounded to one decimal. Wait, wait, -0.67 is about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. No, wait, -0.67 is between -0.7 and -0.6. But for one decimal place, we look at the second decimal digit. 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal because the second digit is 7, which is ≥5.

Wait, but wait: when you have -0.6699, to one decimal place, it's -0.7 because the next digit (6) is ≥5? No, wait, the number is -0.6699. The first decimal is 6, the second is 6. So, when rounding to one decimal, we look at the second decimal place. So -0.6699 is approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but for one decimal: 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal, because 0.6 is the first decimal, and the next digit is 6, which is ≥5, so you round up. So 0.67 ≈0.7 (when one decimal). So -0.67 would be approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait, but wait, the number is -0.6699. Let me think about it numerically.

-0.6699 is between -0.7 and -0.6. So when rounding to one decimal place, the first decimal is 6, the next is 6, so you round the 6 up to 7, making it -0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps the question allows for an approximate value. So the correct answer would be -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -1.4

B)1.65

C)-0.7

D)0.85

So option C is -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \) are \( 0.5 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), respectively. The probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are:

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the Pauli matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The state \( \psi \) can be written as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]

Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( \psi \):

\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).
