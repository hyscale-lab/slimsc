Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by vectors, and they should be normalized. Let me check: the vector is (-1, 2, 1). To normalize, I need to calculate its magnitude. The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Oh, right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized such that the inner product with themselves is 1.

Next, there are two observables, P and Q, with their corresponding matrices. The operator P has a matrix with first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Operator Q's matrix is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after measuring P. Wait, the order of measurements is important here. So first we measure P, then Q. But I think because we measure P first, the state might collapse into an eigenstate of P, and then when measuring Q, we have to see what the possible outcomes are in that state.

Wait, but let me think again. When you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P, the state becomes an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, the outcome depends on that new state.

So the plan is probably:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure P, the state collapses into one of the eigenstates of P.

2. The possible eigenvalues for P would give the possible outcomes of the measurement. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, the matrix for P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, to find eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - λI) = 0.

But that might be a bit involved. Let me try to compute the characteristic equation.

The matrix P - λI is:

[ -λ   1/√2   0 ]

[1/√2 -λ   1/√2 ]

[ 0   1/√2  -λ ]

Calculating the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to expand along the first row.

So, determinant = -λ * det [ -λ   1/√2; 1/√2  -λ ] 

Minus (1/√2) * det [ 1/√2   1/√2; 0     -λ ] 

Plus 0 * something (third term is zero).

So determinant = -λ [ (λ^2) - (1/2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ]

Wait, let me calculate each minor.

The first minor for the first element (-λ) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ   1/√2 ]

[ 1/√2  -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2.

Then the second term: the element is 1/√2 at (1,2), so its minor is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2:

Row 2 and row3, columns 1 and 3.

So the minor matrix is:

[1/√2   1/√2 ]

[0      -λ ]

Determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ / √2.

So putting it all together:

det(P - λ I) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ / √2 )

Simplify:

= -λ^3 + λ/2 + (1/√2)(λ /√2) )

Wait, 1/√2 times (-λ /√2) is (-λ)/(2). But here, the second term in the determinant formula is multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) times (1/√2) times the minor. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the determinant expansion for a 3x3 matrix is:

sum_{j=1 to 3} (-1)^{1+j} a_{1j} M_{1j} }

So for the first term j=1, a is (-λ), M is the minor for position (1,1).

Second term j=2, a is 1/√2, M is the minor for (1,2).

So the second term is (-1)^{1+2} * (1/√2) * minor.

Which is (-1)^3 * (1/√2) * minor = - (1/√2) * minor.

But in the calculation earlier, the minor's determinant was -λ/√2.

So putting it in:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2 )

Second term: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = (1/√2) * (λ /√2 ) = λ / 2.

So det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2.

Let's compute this:

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) ) + λ/2 )

= -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2

= -λ^3 + λ.

So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ(1 - λ²) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

Wait, because 1 - λ² = (1 - λ)(1 + λ), so λ = 0, 1, -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Hmm, that's interesting. So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

But wait, the state is given and we need the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

So first, let's find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0.

Because the probability we're looking for is when P is measured first and gives 0, then Q is measured and gives -1.

So first, find the eigenvectors corresponding to P's eigenvalue 0.

The matrix P - 0*I is P itself.

So we need to solve P|v> = 0.

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 = -v3.

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as first equation, v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1, 0, -1). So normalized, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2) because 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me check:

For v = (1, 0, -1), the norm is sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector is |0> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but when we measure P, the state collapses into this |0> state if the outcome is 0.

So the initial state is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6).

We need to compute the amplitude of |ψ> in the eigenvector |0> of P.

The probability is |<0|ψ>|^2.

So compute <0|ψ> = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2)  ⋅  [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6)

Wait, wait, the initial vector is (-1, 2, 1) scaled by 1/sqrt(6).

So <0|ψ> = [1/sqrt(2)] * [ (-1)/sqrt(6) *1 + 2 * 0 + 1 * (-1)/sqrt(6) ]

Wait, no, let me write out the vectors:

|0> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2)

|ψ> is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6)

Dot product:

(1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1)  divided by sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) )

= [ -1 + 0 -1 ] / sqrt(12 )

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3)

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 for P is 1/3.

But wait, that's just the first part. Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses into |0>, which is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q and get -1. So what's the probability of that?

The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So |1> is (1, 0, 0), |0> Q is (0, 1, 0), but since Q's middle entry is 0, the eigenvector is any vector in that component. Wait, no, for Q, the matrix is diagonal, so the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

Wait, Q's matrix is:

[1 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 -1]

So the eigenvectors are:

For eigenvalue 1: (1,0,0)

Eigenvalue 0: any vector in the second component, but since the Q matrix has 0 in the second diagonal, any vector with only the second component would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Wait, but actually, any vector orthogonal to the first and third basis vectors would be in the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0.

Wait, perhaps I should find the eigenvectors.

For Q, the eigenvectors are:

For eigenvalue 1: (1,0,0)

For eigenvalue 0: any vector where the first and third components are zero, i.e., (0, a, 0), a is any scalar.

For eigenvalue -1: (0,0,1).

So the state after measuring P is |0> = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

We want to compute the projection of |0> onto the eigenvectors of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1.

But the eigenvectors for Q are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).

So the eigenvector for -1 is (0,0,1).

So the amplitude is < -1 | 0 >.

Which is (0,0,1) ⋅ (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2) = (0 +0 + (-1))/sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (1/2).

Wait, no, the inner product is (0)(1) +0*(0) +1*(-1) all divided by sqrt(2), so yes, (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is |(-1)/sqrt(2)|² = (1/2).

Wait, but wait a second. The state |0> is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). The eigenvector for Q being -1 is |q> = (0,0,1). So the projection is (0,0,1) ⋅ |0> is (0)(1) + 0*(0) + 1*(-1) ) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, wait, no. The inner product <q|0> is (0,0,1) ⋅ (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) = (0*1 + 0*0 +1*(-1)) / sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is |(-1/sqrt(2))|^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but that's the probability for measuring Q = -1 given that the state is |0>.

So the total probability we're looking for is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0.

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but that would be if the two measurements are independent, but in reality, the second measurement is conditioned on the first. So the overall probability is (probability P=0) * (probability Q=-1 given P=0) = 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the probability is 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

The problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to calculate the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) when \( P \) is measured first, followed by \( Q \).

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The initial state is given as \( (-1, 2, 1) \). To normalize it, compute the magnitude squared:
\[
\text{Magnitude}^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix for \( P \) is:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, solve \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After calculations, the eigenvalues are:
\[
\lambda_P = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]
For \( \lambda_P = 0 \), the eigenvector is found by solving \( P|v\rangle = 0 \). The eigenvector is:
\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1).
\]

### Step 3: Probability of \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |0\rangle \):
\[
P(P=0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2.
\]
Compute the inner product:
\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1) = \frac{-1 + 0 - 1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(P=0) = \left|\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal:
\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvectors of \( Q \) are the standard basis vectors:
- \( |1\rangle = (1, 0, 0) \) for \( Q = 1 \),
- \( |0\rangle = (0, 1, 0) \) for \( Q = 0 \),
- \( |-1\rangle = (0, 0, 1) \) for \( Q = -1 \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the projection of \( |0\rangle \) onto \( |-1\rangle \):
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle -1 | 0 \rangle|^2.
\]
Compute the inner product:
\[
\langle -1 | 0 \rangle = (0, 0, 1) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left|\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability is the product of the probabilities:
\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
