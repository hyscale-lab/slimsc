Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. The field f(r) falls off as 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Hmm.

Wait, so f(r) is a vector field. Since it's only along the radial direction, the vector f can be written as f(r) er, where er is the unit radial vector. And the magnitude is given as 1/r², so f(r) = (1/r²) er.

I remember that the divergence of a vector field depends on how the field behaves in space. For a radial vector field like this, the divergence in spherical coordinates might be simpler than in Cartesian. Let me recall the formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates. Oh right, the divergence of a vector field A in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r) / dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ dφ)) dA_φ/dφ) ]. But wait, in this case, the field only has a radial component, so A_θ and A_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies a lot.

So, the divergence of f(r) would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * A_r). Since A_r is (1/r²), let's plug that in. So A_r = 1/r², so r² A_r is r²*(1/r²) = 1. Then, d/dr of that is d/ dr (1) which is zero. So the divergence is (1/r²)(0) )= 0? Wait, that can't be right because then the integral would be zero, which is one of the options.

Wait, but wait a second. What if I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. Let me write it out more carefully.

f(r) = (1/r²) er.

So, to find the divergence of f, in spherical coordinates, since f has only the r-component, the divergence is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

So, r² times (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin.

But wait, what about the origin? Because the field is singular there, right? So maybe the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But when taking the volume integral, we're integrating over the sphere of radius R, including the origin.

Hmm, but wait. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at a point (the origin), then the integral would be zero. Because the divergence is zero in the volume except at r=0, which is a point of measure zero.

But wait, another thought: I've heard of Gauss's law in the context of vector calculus. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. So, applying the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f inside a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface S bounding V.

In this case, our volume is a sphere of radius R. So the surface integral becomes the integral over the sphere of f(r) · n dS, where n is the outward normal vector (which is er at the surface).

So f(r) at the surface is (1/R²) er. The normal vector is er, so the dot product is (1/R²) er · er = 1/R².

The surface area of the sphere is 4 π R². So the integral would be (1/R²) * 4 π R² =4 π.

Wait a second, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion from computing the divergence. So why the discrepancy?

Because the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at the origin. So, according to the divergence theorem, the integral over the volume (which is zero except at a point) would be equal to the flux through the surface, which is 4 π.

But wait, that suggests that the divergence is not zero everywhere. Hmm, perhaps my initial calculation was missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the divergence. Let me re-examine that.

f(r) = (1/r²) er.

The divergence in spherical coordinates for a purely radial vector field is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r). So A_r is 1/r². So r² A_r is 1. Then, the derivative d/dr (1) is zero. So divergence is zero.

But according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface is 4 π, so the volume integral of the divergence should be 4 π. So, but according to my calculation, the divergence is zero, so the integral would be zero, which contradicts the surface integral result.

Ah, perhaps the divergence is actually a delta function at the origin. Because the field behaves like the electric field of a point charge. For example, the electric field of a point charge has E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) er, whose divergence is (1/(4πε₀)) q δ³(r). Oh wait, right! So in this case, if f(r) is like a radial field 1/r², then its divergence is a delta function at the origin.

So the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So when I integrate ∇·f over the volume of the sphere of radius R, it depends on whether the origin is inside the volume. Since the sphere is centered at the origin and radius R>0, the origin is inside.

So the integral becomes the integral of the delta function over the volume, which is just the charge enclosed, so to speak. For this case, the divergence would be 4 π δ³(r), perhaps? Wait, let me think.

Wait, the electric field is E = (k q) (1/r²) er. The divergence in this case is (k q) δ³(r). So the integral of ∇·E over any volume that includes the origin is k q.

But in our problem, f(r) = (1/r²) er. So if we think of it as E(r) = (1) (1/r²) er, then the divergence would be (1) δ³(r). So the integral over any volume containing the origin would be 1. Wait, but the divergence theorem gave me 4 π from the surface integral. So that suggests that the divergence is 4 π δ³(r). Or wait, maybe I'm getting the constants wrong.

Wait, Gauss's law states that ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, and for a point charge, the integral of ∇·E over all space is Q / ε₀. So in our case, the integral over the sphere would be Q if the enclosed charge is Q. But in the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f is the flux of f through the surface.

So the flux through the sphere of radius R is 4 π, which equals the integral of ∇·f over the volume. Since the divergence is zero except at the origin, the integral picks up the contribution only at the origin, which must be 4 π. So perhaps the divergence is 4 π delta(r).

Wait, let me recompute the divergence. Maybe I missed a factor earlier.

So, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) er. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r). A_r is 1/r², so r² A_r = 1. d/dr (1) is zero. So divergence is zero, except at r=0.

Wait, but this seems conflicting. Because using the divergence theorem, the integral should be 4 pi. So perhaps the correct divergence is 4 pi delta(r). Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the units or the constants. Let me think of f(r) as analogous to the electric field due to a charge. The electric field is E = (k q) er / r², where k = 1/(4 pi epsilon_0). The divergence of E is rho / epsilon_0, where rho is the charge density. For a point charge, rho is delta^3(r) multiplied by q.

So, E(r) = (k q) er / r². Then, the divergence is (k q) delta^3(r).

So, ∇ · E = (k q) delta^3(r).

So, the integral of ∇ · E over all space is k q. Because the integral of delta function is 1, so k q.

In our problem, f(r) is (1/r²) er. So, if we set k q =1, then f(r) would correspond to E(r) with k q =1. So, ∇ · f(r) would be 1 * delta^3(r).

Wait, but according to the surface integral, the flux was 4 pi. So, using the divergence theorem, integral of ∇ · f over the sphere is 4 pi, which would be equal to the flux. But if ∇ · f is 1 * delta(r), then the integral would be 1, not 4 pi.

Hmm, this suggests a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the f(r) isn't scaled correctly. Let me compute the divergence properly. Let me compute the divergence mathematically, without relying on analogy.

f(r) = (1/r²) er.

So in spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/(r²)) [d/dr (r² (1/r²)) ] = (1/(r²)) [d/dr (1) ] = (1/(r²)) (0) )= 0, except when r=0.

So, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. But according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface is 4 pi. So, the integral of divergence inside the volume must be 4 pi.

Wait, so if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, but the integral is 4 pi, that suggests that the divergence isn't zero but has a delta function there.

Ah, so perhaps the divergence is 4 pi delta^3(r). Because when I integrate 4 pi delta(r) over the sphere, it would give 4 pi, which matches the surface integral.

So, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation of the divergence. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the divergence calculation in spherical coordinates for a purely radial vector field A(r) er is (dA_r/dr) + (A_r)/(r²) ) / (some factors?) Hmm. Let me write the formula correctly.

The divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇ · A = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) ) + (1/(r sinθ)) dA_φ/dφ )

Since A_θ and A_φ are zero, it simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r )

So, substituting A_r = 1/r²:

(1/r²) * d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ) = (1/r²) * d/dr (1) = 0.

Hmm, so according to this, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the integral over the volume (which includes r=0) must be 4 pi.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So, I must be missing something here. Maybe the issue is that the function 1/r² is not differentiable at r=0, so the divergence is a delta function.

So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the divergence as a distribution. Let me think of this as a distribution.

We can write ∇ · f = 4 pi δ(r), because the flux through a surface enclosing the origin is 4 pi. So, the integral of ∇ · f over any volume enclosing the origin is 4 pi.

Oh wait, but earlier when I thought of E(r) = (k q) er / r², the divergence was (k q) delta(r). So, for our case, where E(r) = (1/r²) er, which is (k q) =1, so ∇ · f = delta(r).

Wait, but according to the surface integral, the flux is 4 pi, so the integral of ∇ · f over the volume is 4 pi. So, if ∇ · f is 4 pi delta(r), then the integral would be 4 pi, which matches.

Ah, so I think I was wrong earlier. The divergence isn't zero; it's a delta function scaled by 4 pi.

Wait, how does that happen? Let me re-do the divergence calculation more carefully.

Let me compute the divergence of f(r) = (1/r²) er.

In spherical coordinates:

∇ · f = (1/(r^2)) d/dr (r² * f_r )

f_r = 1/r², so:

r² * f_r = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0, so ∇ · f = 0, except when r=0.

But this is only valid when r ≠ 0. At r=0, the function isn't defined, and the delta function arises from the non-differentiable point.

So, perhaps the correct way to represent ∇ · f is as 4 pi delta(r), since the flux through a surface of radius R is 4 pi, which is the integral of ∇ · f over the volume.

Thus, when you integrate ∇ · f over the sphere of radius R, which includes the origin, the integral is 4 pi.

So, the volume integral of the divergence is 4 pi.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) 4 π

B) 1

C) 4/3 π R 

D) 0

So the correct answer would be A) 4 pi.

But let's think again. The initial calculation suggested that the divergence is zero, but the divergence theorem tells us that the integral is 4 pi.

Ah, right. So the question is about the volume integral, which is the same as the flux through the surface, which is 4 pi.

So, the answer should be A) 4 π.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)**, which is radial and falls off as **f(r) = 1/r²**. The field has only a radial component in spherical coordinates. Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of **f(r)** over a sphere of radius **R** is equivalent to the flux of **f(r)** through the surface of the sphere.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Field and Divergence**:  
   The vector field is given as **f(r) = (1/r²) er**, where **er** is the unit radial vector. The divergence of a radial vector field in spherical coordinates is:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right),
   \]
   where **f_r** is the radial component of the field. Substituting **f_r = 1/r²**, we get:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0.
   \]
   This shows that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin.

2. **Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the field through the surface bounding the volume:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS,
   \]
   where **n** is the outward normal vector to the surface. For the given field **f(r) = (1/r²) er**, the flux through the surface of a sphere of radius **R** is:
   \[
   \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dS = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
   \]

3. **Delta Function at the Origin**:  
   The divergence of **f(r)** is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is singular. This singularity can be represented as a delta function, **∇ · f = 4π δ³(r)**. The volume integral of **∇ · f** over the sphere of radius **R** is then:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The volume integral of the divergence of **f(r)** inside the sphere of radius **R** is **4π**, which matches the flux through the surface and accounts for the singularity at the origin.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 4π**: Correct, as shown by the divergence theorem and the flux calculation.  
- **B) 1**: Incorrect, as the integral is not a dimensionless quantity.  
- **C) 4/3 π R**: Incorrect, as this does not match the divergence theorem result.  
- **D) 0**: Incorrect, as the divergence is not zero due to the singularity at the origin.

The correct answer is **A) 4π**.
