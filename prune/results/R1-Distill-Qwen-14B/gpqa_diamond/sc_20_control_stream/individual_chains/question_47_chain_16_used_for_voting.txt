Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. The degrees of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That would be (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a benzene ring (which is three degrees) plus a double bond or a carbonyl or two rings, but more likely a benzene ring and a carbonyl group. Or maybe a benzene and an amide or something like that.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 is likely a carbonyl (C=O). So maybe it's an amide because amides have two N-H stretches (but sometimes one is stronger than the other) and a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid, but the molecular formula doesn't have enough O for that. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Carboxylic acid would have a -COOH group, which would be O2. So that's possible if the -COOH is present. But looking at the options, I don't see a carboxylic acid. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Hmm. So, let's think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzene ring with ethoxy at position 3 and an amide group somewhere. Wait, benzamide is a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have OCH2CH3 at position 3 and CONH2 at another position, perhaps para.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would be a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at para (position 4), and the formamide group (HCON-) attached to that. So the structure would be OCH2CH3 at para and HCON attached to the benzene, maybe at position 1, but the numbering would depend on where the ethoxy is.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with NH2 at position 4, and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) attached somewhere, perhaps as an ester. Wait, propionate is the ionized form of propionic acid, so maybe it's an ester. So like OOCR, where R is ethyl or something else. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate each option's formula.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate would be a benzene ring with a COOEt group (where Et is ethyl). The 4-aminobenzoate would have an NH2 at position 4 and a COOEt at position 1 (para to each other). So the structure would be OEt-CO-O- attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. Wait, no, ethyl benzoate would be benzene with COOEt. So 4-aminobenzoate would have NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1. So the formula would be C9H11NO2: benzene (6 C) + COOEt (3 C) gives 9. Yes, matches.

Wait, the molecular formula of D is C9H11NO2. Let me check each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since it's replacing a H on the benzene). Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding an ethoxy at position 3: so the structure is OCH2CH3 attached to C3 of benzene, and CONH2 attached elsewhere. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (CONH2) + 2 (ethoxy) = 11? Wait, no. Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (which is C2H5O) would make it C9H9NO3? Because benzamide is 7 carbons, adding 2 more (ethoxy) would make 9. But the formula here is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzene ring with ethoxy at C3 and amide (CONH2) at another position. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me compute:

Benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + CONH2 (which is O and N, but no additional C beyond the benzene). Wait, no, benzamide is C6H5CONH2, which is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would replace a H on the benzene, so adding 2 C and 5 H (since OCH2CH3 has 2 C and 5 H, as it's -OCH2CH3). So molecular formula would be C7 + 2 = C9, H7 (from benzamide) +5 (from ethoxy) = H12. But wait, the original benzamide has 7 C, adding ethoxy adds 2 C (so 9 C), and H: benzamide is 7 H, the ethoxy adds 5 (but also replaces one H on benzene, so 7 +5 -1 = 11 H). So formula is C9H11NO3? Because benzamide is NO2, adding ethoxy adds an O (since ethoxy is O-) so now O becomes 3. But the given formula is NO2, so that can't be. So option A's formula would be C9H11NO3, but the given is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem. So maybe option A is not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So in this case, the formamide is attached to a benzene ring. The structure is benzene with ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group (HCON-) attached to the benzene. So the formula: benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + formamide (HCON-) which is 2 O, 1 N. So total C:6+2+ (HCON is 2 C?) Wait, formamide is HCONR2. Wait, in this case, R is the benzene. So the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + formamide (HCON-) which adds 2 C (from the formyl group and the amide). Hmm, not sure. Let me count.

Wait, the benzene has 6 C, ethoxy adds 2, formamide's HCON adds 2 (CO and N). So total C:6+2+2=10. But the given formula is C9. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think: formamide is HCONR2, where R is aryl. So the formula for the compound would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) plus HCON-. Wait, no. Let me count each part.

The benzene ring in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have:

- 6 C (benzene)
- 1 O from the ethoxy (OCH2CH3)
- 1 O from the formamide (HCON)
So the molecule is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C6H5-OCH2CH3) connected to HCON-.

So the entire molecule is:

HCON-(4-OCH2CH3-C6H4-).

So the formula would be: C6 (from benzene) + 2 (from OCH2CH3) + 2 (from HCON: C=O and N) = C6 + 2 + 2= C10? Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute each component:

Ph-OCH2CH3: C6 + 2 C (ethoxy) = C8.

The formamide part is HCON-: which is 2 C (HCO and N). So 8 +2 =10 C. But the formula is C9. So this can't be. Therefore, option B has C10, which doesn't match. So option B is out.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So structure would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionyl group as an ester or something.

Wait, propionate is RCOO-. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene at, say, position 1, and NH2 at position 4.

So the molecular formula: benzene (6 C) + NH2 (no C) + propionate (CH2CH2COO-) which is 3 C. So total C:6+3=9. That matches. H: let's compute.

Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents, NH2 and propionate ester). Wait, benzene has 6 H, but with two substituents (NH2 and propionate), so 6 -2 (since each substituent replaces a H) = 4 H. Plus the propionate group: the propionate is -OOCR where R is CH2CH3. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be O-CO-OEt? Wait, no, wait. 4-aminophenyl propionate could be either phenyl ester or something else. Wait, maybe it's (4-aminophenyl) propanoate. So the structure is O-CO-O-(CH2)2CH3 attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, the formula for 4-aminophenyl propionate would be:

Ph is C6H5, but with NH2 and OCOCH2CH2CH3 substituents.

Wait, let's count:

Ph has 6 C.

NH2: no C.

O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3: that's 3 C.

So total C: 6 + 3 =9. Correct.

Hydrogen: Ph has 5 H (since two substituents, each replacing one H). Plus, the propionate group: OCOCH2CH2CH3 has 3*2 +3 (from CH2CH2CH3?) Wait, no, the propionate is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the substituent is O-CO-O-(CH2)2CH3. So the group is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3.

The substituent adds how many H? The OCH2CH2CH3 has 3*2=6 H (since each CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3). But the ester oxygen would have: O-CO-O-R. So the R is CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, let's compute each part:

Ph group (with two substituents) contributes 5 H.

The O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 group: the ester has a OCH2CH2CH3, which has 2*2 +3 =7 H (each of the two CH2 groups has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H). Wait, no: OCH2CH2CH3 has (CH2)2CH3. The structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH3. Each CH2 group has 2 H, so 2 groups contribute 4 H, and the CH3 has 3, so 7 H.

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So the oxygen is attached to the CH2CH2CH3. So that part has 7 H. Plus the benzene's 5 H, and the NH2 group: NH2 has 2 H (but those are part of the benzene's substituents).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the entire formula.

Ph group (6 C, 5 H), the substituents are NH2 (which is 1 C? No, NH2 is not a carbon. Wait, no, NH2 is attached to the benzene, so it doesn't contribute C beyond the benzene.

The propionate part is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So that's:

O (from the ester) connects to COO- and then CH2CH2CH3.

So the formula would be:

C6H5-NH2 (but that's not correct because in the propionate, it's an ester group. Wait, no, the 4-aminophenyl propionate is (4-aminophenyl) ester of propionic acid. So the structure is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring at position 4 (since it's 4-aminophenyl). Wait, no, the aminophenyl is at position 4, so perhaps the ester is at position 1, making them para substituents.

So the molecular formula would be:

Ph (6 C, 5 H) + NH2 (no C, 2 H) + O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (which has 3 C, 7 H, and 3 O).

So the total:

C:6 +3 =9.

H:5 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) +7 (ester) =14? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 14 H but the formula has H11. That's a discrepancy. So that can't be right. So maybe option C is not the correct one.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with NH2 at position 4 and COOEt (where Et is ethyl) at position 1. So the formula: benzene (6 C) + COOEt (3 C) + NH2 (no C). So total C is 6+3=9. That matches.

Hydrogen: benzene has 6 H, but two substituents (NH2 and COOEt) replace two H, so 4 H on the benzene. COOEt is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2 +3 =5 H). The NH2 group has 2 H. So total H:

Benzene:4

COOEt:5

NH2:2

Plus any from the carbonyl or ester groups? Wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-O-CH2CH3, which has 5 H.

So total H:4 (Ph) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) =11. Which matches the formula C9H11NO2.

So the formula matches option D.

Now, let's look at the spectral data.

IR: strong absorption at 3420 and 3325. Those are likely N-H stretches. Since it's a primary amine (NH2), there should be two peaks, but sometimes they can be close together, so a medium to strong absorption. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl. In esters, the carbonyl is around 1720-1760 cm^-1, which fits.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): this is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, possibly an NH2 group. But wait, in D, the NH2 is on the benzene. So if it's NH2, it would typically be a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a 2H singlet. Alternatively, the ethyl group attached to oxygen (like OCH2CH3) would have triplet around 1.2 and quartet around 4.0-4.3.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl's CH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): maybe the OCH2 group? Wait, no, ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3. So the quartet is usually around 4.1-4.3 for the OCH2.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Quartet suggests splitting into four, which could be adjacent to a CH2 group. Typically, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. Wait, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5 ppm for 2H. That's a bit upfield for an ethyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the splitting in ethyl groups: the CH2 adjacent to O is a quartet because it's next to the CH3. The CH3 is a triplet. So in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm, integrating for 2H. The CH3 would be a triplet at ~1.2 ppm (3H). The given data shows 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). So that fits with an ethyl group.

The other peaks: 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. That's a bit tricky. Could that be the NH2 group? Because in D, the NH2 is on the benzene. NH2 protons usually appear as broad signals. But they would be split into a singlet if the protons are equivalent and not split by adjacent protons. Wait, but NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the integration is 2H. So perhaps it's an NH2 group, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet. Alternatively, it could be another group.

Wait, another possibility: the OCH2 in an ester would typically be a quartet, but in this NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm and has 2H. The triplet is at 1.2 ppm (3H). So that fits the ethyl ester group.

So the splitting is consistent with an ethyl ester. Let's see:

Ethyl group in ester: OCH2CH3.

So the OCH2 would be a quartet (q) at ~4.1-4.3 ppm, but here it's at 4.5. Maybe it's a bit deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.

But let's proceed. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2. Wait, but in D, the NH2 is not attached to anything else, so it would be a singlet. But in reality, NH2 protons are usually broad because of the exchange with water, etc. So perhaps that's the NH2.

But looking at the NMR, there's another peak at 4.5 ppm, which is a quartet (q, 2H). That would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.

So, the ethyl group would contribute 1.2 ppm (t) and 4.5 ppm (q). The NH2 would be at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (2H).

Now, the aromatic protons. The NMR shows 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This is typical of a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets suggest that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. That would happen if there are two substituents para to each other, each causing the adjacent protons to be deshielded.

In option D, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt, which are para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets: the protons adjacent to NH2 would be downfield (around 8 ppm) and those adjacent to COOEt would be around 7 ppm. Alternatively, it could be the other way around, but the pattern of doublets would fit.

So putting it all together:

IR shows N-H (from amine) and carbonyl (ester).

NMR shows ethyl group, NH2, and para-substituted aromatic ring.

Which matches option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. The degrees of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That would be (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a benzene ring (which is three degrees) plus a double bond or a carbonyl or two rings, but more likely a benzene ring and a carbonyl group. Or maybe a benzene and an amide or something like that.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 is likely a carbonyl (C=O). So maybe it's an amide because amides have two N-H stretches (but sometimes one is stronger than the other) and a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid, but the molecular formula doesn't have enough O for that. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Carboxylic acid would have a -COOH group, which would be O2. So that's possible if the -COOH is present. But looking at the options, I don't see a carboxylic acid. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Hmm. So, let's think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzene ring with ethoxy at position 3 and an amide group somewhere. Wait, benzamide is a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have OCH2CH3 at position 3 and CONH2 at another position, perhaps para.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would be a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at para (position 4), and the formamide group (HCON-) attached to that. So the structure would be OCH2CH3 at para and HCON attached to the benzene, maybe at position 1, but the numbering would depend on where the ethoxy is.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with NH2 at position 4, and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) attached somewhere, perhaps as an ester. Wait, propionate is the ionized form of propionic acid, so maybe it's an ester. So like OOCR, where R is ethyl or something else. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate each option's formula.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate would be a benzene ring with a COOEt group (where Et is ethyl). The 4-aminobenzoate would have an NH2 at position 4 and a COOEt at position 1 (para to each other). So the structure would be OEt-CO-O- attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. Wait, no, ethyl benzoate would be benzene with COOEt. So 4-aminobenzoate would have NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1. So the formula would be C9H11NO2: benzene (6 C) + COOEt (3 C) gives 9. Yes, matches.

Wait, the molecular formula of D is C9H11NO2. Let me check each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since it's replacing a H on the benzene). Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding an ethoxy at position 3: so the structure is OCH2CH3 attached to C3 of benzene, and CONH2 attached elsewhere. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (CONH2) + 2 (ethoxy) = 11? Wait, no. Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (which is C2H5O) would make it C9H9NO3? Because benzamide is 7 carbons, adding 2 more (ethoxy) would make 9. But the formula here is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzene ring with ethoxy at C3 and amide (CONH2) at another position. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me compute:

Benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + CONH2 (which is O and N, but no additional C beyond the benzene). Wait, no, benzamide is C6H5CONH2, which is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would replace a H on the benzene, so adding 2 C and 5 H (since OCH2CH3 has 2 C and 5 H, as it's -OCH2CH3). So molecular formula would be C7 + 2 = C9, H7 (from benzamide) +5 (from ethoxy) = H12. But wait, the original benzamide has 7 C, adding ethoxy adds 2 C (so 9 C), and H: benzamide is 7 H, the ethoxy adds 5 (but also replaces one H on benzene, so 7 +5 -1 = 11 H). So formula is C9H11NO3? Because benzamide is NO2, adding ethoxy adds an O (since ethoxy is O-) so now O becomes 3. But the given formula is NO2, so that can't be. So option A's formula would be C9H11NO3, but the given is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem. So maybe option A is not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So in this case, the formamide is attached to a benzene ring. The structure is benzene with ethoxy at position 4 and the formamide group (HCON-) attached to the benzene. So the formula: benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + formamide (HCON-) which is 2 O, 1 N. So total C:6+2+ (HCON is 2 C?) Wait, formamide is HCONR2. Wait, in this case, R is the benzene. So the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + formamide (HCON-) which adds 2 C (from the formyl group and the amide). Hmm, not sure. Let me count.

Wait, the benzene has 6 C, ethoxy adds 2, formamide's HCON adds 2 (CO and N). So total C:6+2+2=10. But the given formula is C9. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think: formamide is HCONR2, where R is aryl. So the formula for the compound would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) plus HCON-. Wait, no. Let me count each part.

The benzene ring in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have:

- 6 C (benzene)
- 1 O from the ethoxy (OCH2CH3)
- 1 O from the formamide (HCON)
So the molecule is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C6H5-OCH2CH3) connected to HCON-.

So the entire molecule is:

HCON-(4-OCH2CH3-C6H4-).

So the formula would be: C6 (from benzene) + 2 (from OCH2CH3) + 2 (from HCON: C=O and N) = C6 + 2 + 2= C10? Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute each component:

Ph-OCH2CH3: C6 + 2 C (ethoxy) = C8.

The formamide part is HCON-: which is 2 C (HCO and N). So 8 +2 =10 C. But the formula is C9. So this can't be. Therefore, option B has C10, which doesn't match. So option B is out.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So structure would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionyl group as an ester or something.

Wait, propionate is RCOO-. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene at, say, position 1, and NH2 at position 4.

So the molecular formula: benzene (6 C) + NH2 (no C) + propionate (CH2CH2COO-) which is 3 C. So total C:6+3=9. That matches. H: let's compute.

Benzene has 5 H (since two substituents, NH2 and propionate ester). Wait, benzene has 6 H, but with two substituents (NH2 and propionate), so 6 -2 (since each substituent replaces a H) = 4 H. Plus the propionate group: the propionate is -OOCR where R is CH2CH3. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be O-CO-OEt? Wait, no, wait. 4-aminophenyl propionate could be either phenyl ester or something else. Wait, maybe it's (4-aminophenyl) propanoate. So the structure is O-CO-O-(CH2)2CH3 attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, the formula for 4-aminophenyl propionate would be:

Ph is C6H5, but with NH2 and OCOCH2CH2CH3 substituents.

Wait, let's count:

Ph has 6 C.

NH2: no C.

O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3: that's 3 C.

So total C: 6 + 3 =9. Correct.

Hydrogen: Ph has 5 H (since two substituents, each replacing one H). Plus, the propionate group: OCOCH2CH2CH3 has 3*2 +3 (from CH2CH2CH3?) Wait, no, the propionate is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the substituent is O-CO-O-(CH2)2CH3. So the group is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3.

The substituent adds how many H? The OCH2CH2CH3 has 3*2=6 H (since each CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3). But the ester oxygen would have: O-CO-O-R. So the R is CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, let's compute each part:

Ph group (with two substituents) contributes 5 H.

The O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 group: the ester has a OCH2CH2CH3, which has 2*2 +3 =7 H (each of the two CH2 groups has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H). Wait, no: OCH2CH2CH3 has (CH2)2CH3. The structure is O-CH2-CH2-CH3. Each CH2 group has 2 H, so 2 groups contribute 4 H, and the CH3 has 3, so 7 H.

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So the oxygen is attached to the CH2CH2CH3. So that part has 7 H. Plus the benzene's 5 H, and the NH2 group: NH2 has 2 H (but those are part of the benzene's substituents).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the entire formula.

Ph group (6 C, 5 H), the substituents are NH2 (which is 1 C? No, NH2 is not a carbon. Wait, no, NH2 is attached to the benzene, so it doesn't contribute C beyond the benzene.

The propionate part is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So that's:

O (from the ester) connects to COO- and then CH2CH2CH3.

So the formula would be:

C6H5-NH2 (but that's not correct because in the propionate, it's an ester group. Wait, no, the 4-aminophenyl propionate is (4-aminophenyl) ester of propionic acid. So the structure is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring at position 4 (since it's 4-aminophenyl). Wait, no, the aminophenyl is at position 4, so perhaps the ester is at position 1, making them para substituents.

So the molecular formula would be:

Ph (6 C, 5 H) + NH2 (no C, 2 H) + O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3 (which has 3 C, 7 H, and 3 O).

So the total:

C:6 +3 =9.

H:5 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) +7 (ester) =14? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 14 H but the formula has H11. That's a discrepancy. So that can't be right. So maybe option C is not the correct one.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with NH2 at position 4 and COOEt (where Et is ethyl) at position 1. So the formula: benzene (6 C) + COOEt (3 C) + NH2 (no C). So total C is 6+3=9. That matches.

Hydrogen: benzene has 6 H, but two substituents (NH2 and COOEt) replace two H, so 4 H on the benzene. COOEt is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2 +3 =5 H). The NH2 group has 2 H. So total H:

Benzene:4

COOEt:5

NH2:2

Plus any from the carbonyl or ester groups? Wait, no. The ester group is O-CO-O-CH2CH3, which has 5 H.

So total H:4 (Ph) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) =11. Which matches the formula C9H11NO2.

So the formula matches option D.

Now, let's look at the spectral data.

IR: strong absorption at 3420 and 3325. Those are likely N-H stretches. Since it's a primary amine (NH2), there should be two peaks, but sometimes they can be close together, so a medium to strong absorption. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl. In esters, the carbonyl is around 1720-1760 cm^-1, which fits.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): this is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, possibly an NH2 group. But wait, in D, the NH2 is on the benzene. So if it's NH2, it would typically be a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a 2H singlet. Alternatively, the ethyl group attached to oxygen (like OCH2CH3) would have triplet around 1.2 and quartet around 4.0-4.3.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl's CH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): maybe the OCH2 group? Wait, no, ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3. So the quartet is usually around 4.1-4.3 for the OCH2.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Quartet suggests splitting into four, which could be adjacent to a CH2 group. Typically, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. Wait, but the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5 ppm for 2H. That's a bit upfield for an ethyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the splitting in ethyl groups: the CH2 adjacent to O is a quartet because it's next to the CH3. The CH3 is a triplet. So in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm, integrating for 2H. The CH3 would be a triplet at ~1.2 ppm (3H). The given data shows 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). So that fits with an ethyl group.

The other peaks: 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. That's a bit tricky. Could that be the NH2 group? Because in D, the NH2 is on the benzene. NH2 protons usually appear as broad signals. But they would be split into a singlet if the protons are equivalent and not split by adjacent protons. Wait, but NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the integration is 2H. So perhaps it's an NH2 group, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet. Alternatively, it could be another group.

Wait, another possibility: the OCH2 in an ester would typically be a quartet, but in this NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm and has 2H. The triplet is at 1.2 ppm (3H). So that fits the ethyl ester group.

So the splitting is consistent with an ethyl ester. Let's see:

Ethyl group in ester: OCH2CH3.

So the OCH2 would be a quartet (q) at ~4.1-4.3 ppm, but here it's at 4.5. Maybe it's a bit deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.

But let's proceed. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2. Wait, but in D, the NH2 is not attached to anything else, so it would be a singlet. But in reality, NH2 protons are usually broad because of the exchange with water, etc. So perhaps that's the NH2.

But looking at the NMR, there's another peak at 4.5 ppm, which is a quartet (q, 2H). That would be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.

So, the ethyl group would contribute 1.2 ppm (t) and 4.5 ppm (q). The NH2 would be at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (2H).

Now, the aromatic protons. The NMR shows 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This is typical of a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets suggest that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. That would happen if there are two substituents para to each other, each causing the adjacent protons to be deshielded.

In option D, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt, which are para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two doublets: the protons adjacent to NH2 would be downfield (around 8 ppm) and those adjacent to COOEt would be around 7 ppm. Alternatively, it could be the other way around, but the pattern of doublets would fit.

So putting it all together:

IR shows N-H (from amine) and carbonyl (ester).

NMR shows ethyl group, NH2, and para-substituted aromatic ring.

Which matches option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
