Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and see what's going on. 

The question involves cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what the complexes are. Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The blue color is associated with the Co(SCN)_n complexes. Specifically, I think the blue ones are the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ and [Co(SCN)_3]³− complexes. Wait, no, wait. I remember that the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]²+, which is blue. But the problem says 'blue dithiocyanato', so maybe that's the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex, which is the second complex in the series.

Wait, the stability constants are given in order: β1, β2, β3, β4. I think each β represents the formation of a complex with n thiocyanate ions. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]²+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^−? Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the charge. Let me think: Co²+ with SCN^-.

So, for each complex:
- [Co(SCN)]^+ : Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, so charge is +1. So β1 is the stability constant for this.
- [Co(SCN)_2]²+ : each SCN is -1, so 2*(-1) = -2. Co²+ plus 2 SCN^- gives [Co(SCN)_2]²+^0? Wait, no: Co²+ (charge +2) plus 2 SCN^- (each -1) → +2 + (-2) = 0. So the complex is neutral. So β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2] which is neutral?
Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The stability constant for the nth complex is βn = [Cn]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n). So each β corresponds to the nth complex.

Wait, actually, the general formula for the stability constant is βn = [Complex]/([M][L]^n), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand. So for each n, βn is the constant for the complex with n ligands.

So, for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → [Co²+][SCN^-] → but the charge would be +2 + (-1) = +1. So [Co(SCN)]^+ has β1=9.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → charge is 0. So β2=40.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^− → charge is -1. So β3=63.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2− → charge is -2. So β4=16.

So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which would be the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So I need to find the fraction of this complex relative to all cobalt species.

The problem asks for the percentage of this blue complex among all cobalt-containing species. So I need to calculate the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

The total cobalt concentration is given as 0.01 M. But that's the total concentration of all species, including the free Co²+ and all the complexes. So the sum of [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2− equals 0.01 M.

Wait, but also, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. So the SCN^- is in excess, so the formation of complexes will depend on the stability constants.

I think this is a problem where I need to calculate the distribution of Co²+ among all possible complexes, considering the stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

The approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The stability constants determine how much each complex will form.

The general approach for such a problem is to set up expressions for each complex concentration in terms of the free Co²+ concentration, [Co²+], and the SCN^- concentration, [SCN^-].

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex can be written as:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^1.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * x * [SCN]^2.

[Co(SCN)_3]^− = β3 * x * [SCN]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = β4 * x * [SCN]^4.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the stability constant for each complex is:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n.

Since [SCN^-] is much higher than the other concentrations (0.1 M is quite high compared to 1e-2 M), we might approximate that [SCN^-] is approximately constant, so we can treat [SCN^-] as 0.1 M.

So, the concentrations of the complexes can be written as:

C1 = β1 * x * (0.1)^1

C2 = β2 * x * (0.1)^2

C3 = β3 * x * (0.1)^3

C4 = β4 * x * (0.1)^4

The total Co concentration is x + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 0.01 M.

Wait, but wait. Because each complex already includes Co²+, so when you add all these, it's the sum of all Co species.

So, x + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 0.01.

Substituting Cn in terms of x:

x + β1 x (0.1) + β2 x (0.1)^2 + β3 x (0.1)^3 + β4 x (0.1)^4 = 0.01.

Factor out x:

x [ 1 + β1 (0.1) + β2 (0.1)^2 + β3 (0.1)^3 + β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 0.01.

So, let's compute the terms inside the brackets.

Compute each term:

β1*(0.1) = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*(0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3*(0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4*(0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001= 0.0016

So adding them all together with 1:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute step by step.

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 + 0.0016=2.3646

So x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M.

So [Co²+] is approximately 0.004224 M.

Now, we can compute the concentrations of each complex.

C1 = β1 x (0.1) = 9 * 0.004224 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004224 = 0.0038016 M.

C2 = β2 x (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004224 * 0.01 =40 * 0.00004224= 0.0016896 M.

C3 =63 * 0.004224 * (0.1)^3 =63 *0.004224 * 0.001=63 *4.224e-6 ≈ 2.66112e-4 M.

C4=16 * 0.004224 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.004224 *1e-4=16*4.224e-8= 6.7584e-7 M.

So, the concentrations of each complex are:

C1 ≈ 0.0038016 M

C2 ≈ 0.0016896 M

C3 ≈ 0.000266112 M

C4 ≈ 0.00000067584 M

And [Co²+] is about 0.004224 M.

Wait a second, but adding all these up:

[Co²+] + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 0.004224 + 0.0038016 + 0.0016896 + 0.000266112 + 0.00000067584 ≈ 0.01 M. That checks out.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is C2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the concentration of C2 is 0.0016896 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is (C2) / (0.01) * 100%.

So fraction = (0.0016896 / 0.01) * 100% = 16.896%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recheck.

The denominator is 2.3646, so 0.01 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.004224, correct.

Then, computing C2: β2 is 40, x is ~0.004224, [SCN]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01.

So 40 * 0.004224 *0.01 = 40 * 0.00004224 = 0.0016896. Yes.

So 0.0016896 is C2.

Total is 0.01, so 0.0016896 / 0.01 is 0.16896, which is 16.896%, so 16.9% approx. So option D is the answer.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the complexes may include different charges, but in solution, the ligand concentration is high, so the approximation that [SCN] remains ~0.1 M is valid. So the calculations are correct.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

### Approach:
1. **Stability Constant Expression**:  
   The stability constant for the \( n \)-th complex is given by:  
   \[
   \beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_n}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
   \]  
   Rearranging, the concentration of each complex is:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for each complex:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 10^{-2}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Let \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \). Substituting \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):  
   \[
   x \left[ 1 + \beta_1 (0.1) + \beta_2 (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 (0.1)^4 \right] = 10^{-2}
   \]  
   Compute the terms inside the brackets:  
   \[
   \beta_1 (0.1) = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \quad \beta_2 (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4, \quad \beta_3 (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063, \quad \beta_4 (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
   \]  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]  
   Solving for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Concentrations of Complexes**:  
   Using \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):  
   \[
   [\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038016 \, \text{M}
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot 0.01 = 0.0016896 \, \text{M}
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot 0.001 = 0.000266112 \, \text{M}
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.00000067584 \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Percentage of Blue Complex**:  
   The blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, with concentration \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = 0.0016896 \, \text{M} \). The percentage is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{\text{Total Co}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.0016896}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.896\%
   \]  
   Rounding to one decimal place: \( 16.9\% \).

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
