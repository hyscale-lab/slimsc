Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's about the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would only be detectable here after that delay.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So we need to find flux(band1)/flux(band2).

First, I should recall what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II goes on to helium-3, and pp-III is another part of the chain. Oh wait, I think pp-III involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei to form helium-4, but wait, isn't that part of the overall pp process? Or maybe I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is more about the reaction where a helium-3 captures two protons to form carbon-12, then that goes on to form nitrogen-14 and eventually back into carbon-12. Or perhaps another step. I'm not exactly sure about the specifics, but I know that the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain which produces neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of certain neutrinos. The main neutrinos from the Sun are produced in the proton-proton chain, especially the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction and the main pp reaction which produces a positron and two neutrinos.

Wait, but I think the pp-III branch is more associated with the production of higher-energy neutrinos. Oh right, in the pp-III branch, a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton to make carbon-12. This process emits a neutrino. These neutrinos are called the "carbon cycle" neutrinos, I think, but in the Sun, the dominant process is the pp chain, which produces lower-energy neutrinos, like the 700-800 keV range.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The main pp chain produces two types of neutrinos: the main reaction (pp I) produces lower-energy neutrinos, and the pep reaction produces even lower-energy ones. Then, the pp-III branch, which is a step in the chain, might produce higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe I'm mixing that up.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for producing the high-energy neutrinos, like the 800-900 keV range. Because the higher the energy, the more energetic the process. So if the pp-III stops, the production of higher-energy neutrinos would stop, while the lower-energy ones (like from the main pp-I and pep reactions) would continue.

Wait, so the main neutrino flux comes from the pp chain. The pep reaction produces lower-energy neutrinos (maybe around 100s of keV?), and the main pp reaction produces around 500-800 keV. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the energy ranges. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is involved in the production of the higher-energy neutrinos, like around 1 MeV or so. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The Sun's neutrino flux is dominated by the pp chain. The main pp reaction produces neutrinos in the range of around 0.5 MeV (500 keV) and lower. But I might be getting the exact numbers wrong. The question is about bands of 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So band1 is 700-800, band2 is 800-900.

If the pp-III branch stopped, which neutrinos would that affect? If pp-III is a part of the chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the flux in the higher band.

Wait, another thought: the pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the reaction:

3He + p → 4He + e+ + ν_e

Wait, no, wait. The proton-proton chain goes through several steps. The first part is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and neutrino. Then, the deuterium captures another proton to form helium-3, which then fuses with another helium-3 to form helium-4, emitting two protons (and maybe emitting more neutrinos? Or are those the two protons part of the energy release? Or perhaps that's the main reaction that produces the neutrinos that we detect.)

Alternatively, the main reaction is:

p + p → 2H + e+ + ν_e

and for the pp-III branch, perhaps:

2H + p → 3H + e+ + ν_e

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the different steps. Alternatively, the pp-III branch could involve the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton to form carbon-12, which then goes through the CNO cycle. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the main neutrinos come from the pp-I and pp-II reactions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the solar neutrino spectrum. The main neutrinos are from the pp chain, which includes the pep and main pp reactions. The pep reaction produces lower-energy neutrinos, around 140 keV, and the main pp reaction produces around 0.5 MeV (like 500 keV) and up. But wait, I've heard that the main neutrino flux peaks around 0.6 MeV (600 keV). So band1 is 700-800, which is near the peak, and band2 is 800-900, a bit higher.

If the pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain, stopping it would affect the flux in certain energy bands. Wait, but the main pp reaction produces a neutrino with energy around 0.5 MeV. So if the pp-III branch is another part of the pp chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos, then stopping it would reduce the flux in higher energy bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominant neutrinos come from the main pp reaction, and the pp-III produces a small fraction of the neutrinos but at higher energies. So if pp-III stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (band2) would drop, while the lower ones (band1) remain more or less the same. So the ratio flux1/flux2 would be higher, because flux2 goes down.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. In the Sun, the majority of the neutrinos come from the main pp reaction, which produces neutrinos with energies around 0.5 MeV. The pep reaction produces a smaller number with lower energy. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor, perhaps, but the neutrinos from that are higher energy. So if we stop the pp-III, the neutrino flux in the higher energy bands would decrease.

So band1 is 700-800, which is just above the main peak. Band2 is 800-900, a bit higher. If the main pp reaction is still producing neutrinos, then band1's flux would be similar to before, but band2's flux would decrease because the pp-III is stopped.

Wait, but the main pp reaction produces neutrinos up to a certain energy. Maybe the main pp neutrinos are in the 500 keV to 800 keV range. So if the pp-III is stopped, which produces higher neutrinos (like above 800 keV), then the flux in band2 (800-900) would drop. So the ratio would be band1 (unchanged or only slightly changed) over band2 (reduced), which would make the ratio higher.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact energy ranges. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III reaction produces the neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, and the main pp produces lower. So if pp-III is stopped, the flux in band2 would drop, while band1 remains roughly the same.

So the flux ratio would be (flux1)/(flux2). If flux2 drops and flux1 doesn't, then the ratio would increase.

Wait, but what if the main pp neutrinos are in the 700-800 range, and the pp-III produces some in 800-900. So if pp-III stops, the 800-900 band would have less. So the flux in band2 decreases, making the ratio flux1/flux2 larger.

But how significant is the contribution from pp-III? The main pp chain produces the majority of the neutrinos. The pp-III is a branch, which might contribute a smaller fraction. So maybe the flux in band2 is a small fraction of the total, and stopping it would reduce that flux, but the flux in band1 is still significant.

So before stopping, the flux in band1 and band2 might be similar. But after stopping, band2 flux would drop, making the ratio increase.

Wait, but what if the main pp reaction produces neutrinos in both bands? Or perhaps the main pp reaction produces most of the neutrinos in band1 and only a small part in band2. So stopping pp-III would eliminate the neutrinos in band2, making the ratio flux1/flux2 equal to the original (flux1)/(flux1 + delta), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the number of neutrinos each process contributes. The main pp reaction produces a large number of neutrinos, and the pp-III produces a smaller number but at higher energies.

If pp-III is stopped, the number of high-energy neutrinos (band2) would decrease, while low-energy (band1) would stay the same. So the ratio would be (same band1 flux) / (lower band2 flux), which is higher than 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 10, option C is 1. So if the ratio becomes 10, that would be a significant change.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III suddenly stopped. So prior to that, the flux in band2 was a certain value, and after, it's zero (assuming pp-III contributes all neutrinos in band2, which isn't the case, but perhaps for the sake of the question, it's assumed).

Wait, but that's probably an over-simplification. So maybe the main pp reaction produces neutrinos across a range, including band1 and band2. The pp-III might produce a small part of band2, so stopping it would only reduce the band2 flux by a fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp reaction produces the majority of the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band, and the pp-III produces a small fraction in the 800-900 keV band. So if pp-III stops, the 800-900 keV flux drops, but the 700-800 remains roughly the same.

So the ratio would be roughly (flux1) / (flux2) = (same) / (reduced). So if originally flux1 and flux2 were similar, the ratio would be higher than 1.

But let's think about the number of neutrinos. The main pp reaction is the dominant source. The pp-III is a minor branch. So the flux in band2 is mainly from pp-III. So if pp-III stops, then band2's flux drops to almost zero, while band1's flux remains (since it's from main pp). So the ratio would be (large) / (small) = about 10 or more.

But looking at the options, option A is 10. So that would be the case if band2's flux drops to almost nothing, making the ratio 10.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the main pp produces neutrinos in both bands, and the pp-III adds to band2. So if pp-III stops, the band2 flux drops, but band1 flux remains. So if originally band1 is 500, band2 is 100, the ratio is 5. So if band2 drops to, say, 50 (because pp-III was responsible for 90% of the band2 flux), the ratio would be 500/50=10.

That would fit option A.

But wait, the question says "the pp-III branch suddenly stopped". So if the pp-III branch contributes a certain amount to band2, but the main pp continues to emit neutrinos in band1, then the ratio would go up.

So the ratio would be (flux1)/(flux2 after stop). If flux2 was previously, say, 100, and after stop, it's 10, then ratio is 10. So option A.

But another thought: the main pp reaction's neutrinos have a spectrum that extends to higher energies as well. So if the main pp neutrinos include some in band2, then stopping pp-III might not eliminate all of band2's flux, just reduce it. So the ratio wouldn't be as high as 10.

Wait, but perhaps the main pp reaction produces neutrinos up to about 800 keV, and the pp-III produces beyond that. So band1 is 700-800, which is the main pp, and band2 is 800-900, which comes mainly from pp-III. So if pp-III stops, band2's flux would drop, making the ratio (band1)/(band2) much higher.

So in that scenario, the ratio would be around 10, so option A.

But I'm a bit uncertain. Another approach is to think about neutrino experiments. The main solar neutrinos detected are around 0.5 MeV, so 500 keV. So band1 (700-800) is higher. Are there any solar neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range? Or is that beyond the main?

Wait, the main pp reaction produces a neutrino with energy up to about 0.5 MeV (peak around 0.42 MeV). So 500 keV is about 0.5 MeV. So perhaps the main neutrinos are in the 0.2 to 0.8 MeV range, with the highest being around 0.8. So band1 is 700-800 (0.7-0.8 MeV), which is the upper end of the main neutrino spectrum.

If the pp-III branch produces neutrinos beyond that, then band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would be from the pp-III. So stopping pp-III would reduce band2 flux.

So band1 is the main neutrino range, and band2 is a small part. So if pp-III is stopped, band2's flux drops, making the ratio (flux1/flux2) much higher.

So let's say prior to stopping, flux1 is about 1000, and flux2 is about 100. Ratio is 10. After stopping, flux2 is 10 (assuming pp-III was 90% of flux2), so ratio is 1000/10=100, which is not an option. Hmm, but the options don't have 100. Option A is 10.

Wait, perhaps I'm overestimating. Maybe the pp-III contributes a smaller fraction to band2. Suppose prior to stopping, flux2 is 20, with 10 from pp-III and 10 from main pp. So stopping pp-III would make flux2=10. Then the ratio would be 100/10=10. So option A.

Alternatively, if pp-III contributes a significant fraction, say, 90% of band2, then flux2 would drop to 10% of its original. So the ratio would be 10. So in that case, the answer is A.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is that the main pp reaction produces neutrinos in both bands, so stopping pp-III only reduces band2 by a small amount, so the ratio might not be as high as 10. But the question says 'the pp-III branch suddenly stopped', implying that all contributions from that branch are gone.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos at lower energies as well. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in the Sun, the proton-proton chain produces two main neutrino spectra: the pep reaction (low energy, ~140 keV) and the main pp reaction (higher energy, up to ~0.5 MeV). The pp-III branch, if it's a part of the main pp, might not add as much. Or perhaps the pp-III produces a different kind of neutrino, perhaps more energetic.

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is the part that produces the high-energy neutrinos, like the so-called 'carbon cycle' neutrinos, but I think the carbon cycle is a separate process.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A:10, B:0.01, C:1, D:0.1.

The ratio is flux1/flux2.

If pp-III stopped, and if flux2 was lower, then the ratio would be higher than 1. So options A or C.

But if the flux2 becomes much smaller, ratio could be 10 (A), but if the fluxes are similar, ratio is 1 (C).

If pp-III is a minor contributor to band2, but the main pp continues to emit some in band2, then the ratio might not be as high as 10. But if pp-III is the main contributor to band2, then stopping it would make band2's flux drop, increasing the ratio.

In the absence of exact data, I think the intended answer is that the flux in band2 drops, making the ratio about 10. So option A.

The question involves analyzing the flux of solar neutrinos in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain and is associated with the production of higher-energy neutrinos. Neutrinos from the Sun are primarily produced in the main proton-proton (pp) reaction and the pep reaction, with the main pp reaction producing neutrinos in the energy range of approximately 0.5 MeV (500 keV) and above. The pp-III branch, being a minor contributor, is specifically linked to higher-energy neutrinos, likely in the 800-900 keV range.

If the pp-III branch stops, the production of higher-energy neutrinos (in the 800-900 keV range) would significantly decrease or cease entirely, while the flux in the 700-800 keV range (produced by the main pp reaction) would remain largely unaffected. This would result in a higher ratio of flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to flux in band 2 (800-900 keV). 

Given that the pp-III branch contributes significantly to the flux in band 2, its sudden stoppage would reduce the flux in band 2 by a substantial fraction, leading to an approximate ratio of 10 for flux(band 1)/flux(band 2). This aligns with option A.
