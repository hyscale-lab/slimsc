Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, expectation values... right, that's the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the operator separately and then combine them.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make things easier.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it's straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So when we compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, it's the same as the probability of each state times their eigenvalues.

So, the probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that part is -0.5. Multiply by 10, and we get -5 for the σz contribution.

Now the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh, wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I think σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. So I can't directly use the same probabilities; I need to compute the expectation value more carefully.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute it as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, the expectation value of σx can be found using the components of the spinor. Let me think about how to approach this.

The state ψ can be written as a column vector. Let's see: |↑⟩ is [1, 0] and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]. So ψ would be [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is a column vector with components α = 0.5 and β = sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value of σx is given by 2 Re(β* α), I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The expectation value of σx is computed as α* β + β* α, but let me get this right.

The operator σx in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |ψ⟩, you get σx |ψ⟩ = [0 1; 1 0][α; β] = [β; α]. Then the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is α* β* + β* α, because ⟨ψ| is [α*, β*].

Wait, wait, no. Let's compute it explicitly. Alternatively, I can just compute ψ† σx ψ.

So ψ is [α; β] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ].

Compute ψ† σx ψ:

= [0.5* , (sqrt(3)/2)* ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Let me compute each part. First, σx times |ψ> is [β; α], so [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ† times that is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). Wait, no, because ψ† is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] and the result of σx|ψ> is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. So the inner product is:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * (0.5) ?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the components. Let me write it out properly.

The inner product is ψ† σx ψ = (α* β + β* α) ?

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly. The matrix multiplication:

ψ† σx ψ: 

= [α* , β* ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [α; β]

Which is [α*, β*] multiplied by [β; α], because σx swaps the components.

So that's (α* β + β* α).

So substituting the values, α = 0.5, β = sqrt(3)/2.

So α* is 0.5, since it's real. β* is sqrt(3)/2 as well, since it's real.

So 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrices have expectation values that are either ±1, multiplied by some coefficients, but perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps σx has expectation value (α β* + β α* ) / (α^2 + β^2) ? No, wait, no, because ψ is normalized. Let me check normalization.

Wait, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The norm is |0.5|^2 + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1, so it's normalized. So the denominator is 1.

So the expectation value of σx is ( α β* + β α* ), because I think that's how it comes out from the calculation.

Wait, no, when I compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, it's (α* β + β* α), which is 2 Re[ α* β ].

Because α and β are real numbers here, since 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2 are real. So Re[ α* β ] is just α β.

So 2 α β = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*( sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait a minute, but earlier I thought the expectation value comes out to be sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So, 5 times that is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

So the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me calculate each part:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.33.

Adding them together: -5 + 4.33 ≈-0.67.

Wait, but wait, the options are given up to one decimal place. So -0.67 would round to -0.7. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So option C is -0.7, which matches our calculation.

But wait, let me recheck the steps because I'm a bit unsure about the expectation value of σx.

Alternative approach: Using matrix representation.

The state vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So σx |ψ> = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Now, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = [sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 ] = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the two contributions are -5 and +4.33, summing to -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively, the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \) is given by the probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities are:

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is calculated using the matrix representation of \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The state \( \psi \) is written as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the components of \( \psi \), so:

\[
\sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = [0.5, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}] \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5, \quad 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is \( -0.7 \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Hmm, expectation values... right, that's the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make things easier.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it's straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So when we compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, it's the same as the probability of each state times their eigenvalues.

So, the probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that part is -0.5. Multiply by 10, and we get -5 for the σz contribution.

Now the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh, wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I think σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. So I can't directly use the same probabilities; I need to compute the expectation value more carefully.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute it as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, the expectation value of σx can be found using the components of the spinor. Let me think about how to approach this.

The state ψ can be written as a column vector. Let's see: |↑⟩ is [1, 0] and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]. So ψ would be [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is a column vector with components α = 0.5 and β = sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value of σx is given by 2 Re(β* α), I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The expectation value of σx is computed as α* β + β* α, but let me get this right.

The operator σx in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |ψ⟩, you get σx |ψ⟩ = [0 1; 1 0][α; β] = [β; α]. Then the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is α* β* + β* α, because ⟨ψ| is [α*, β*].

Wait, wait, no. Let's compute it explicitly. Alternatively, I can just compute ψ† σx ψ.

So ψ is [α; β] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ].

Compute ψ† σx ψ:

= [0.5* , (sqrt(3)/2)* ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Let me compute each part. First, σx times |ψ> is [β; α], so [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ† times that is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). Wait, no, because ψ† is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] and the result of σx|ψ> is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. So the inner product is:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * (0.5) ?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the components. Let me write it out properly.

The inner product is ψ† σx ψ = (α* β + β* α) ?

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly. The matrix multiplication:

ψ† σx ψ: 

= [α* , β* ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [α; β]

Which is [α*, β*] multiplied by [β; α], because σx swaps the components.

So that's (α* β + β* α).

So substituting the values, α = 0.5, β = sqrt(3)/2.

So α* is 0.5, since it's real. β* is sqrt(3)/2 as well, since it's real.

So 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrices have expectation values that are either ±1, multiplied by some coefficients, but perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps σx has expectation value (α β* + β α* ) / (α^2 + β^2) ? No, wait, no, because ψ is normalized. Let me check normalization.

Wait, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The norm is |0.5|^2 + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1, so it's normalized. So the denominator is 1.

So the expectation value of σx is ( α β* + β α* ), because I think that's how it comes out from the calculation.

Wait, no, when I compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, it's (α* β + β* α), which is 2 Re[ α* β ].

Because α and β are real numbers here, since 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2 are real. So Re[ α* β ] is just α β.

So 2 α β = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*( sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait a minute, but earlier I thought the expectation value comes out to be sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So, 5 times that is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

So the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me calculate each part:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.33.

Adding them together: -5 + 4.33 ≈-0.67.

Wait, but wait, the options are given up to one decimal place. So -0.67 would round to -0.7. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So option C is -0.7, which matches our calculation.

But wait, let me recheck the steps because I'm a bit unsure about the expectation value of σx.

Alternative approach: Using matrix representation.

The state vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So σx |ψ> = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Now, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = [sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 ] = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the two contributions are -5 and +4.33, summing to -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively, the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \) is given by the probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities are:

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is calculated using the matrix representation of \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The state \( \psi \) is written as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the components of \( \psi \), so:

\[
\sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = [0.5, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}] \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5, \quad 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is \( -0.7 \).

Answer: C
