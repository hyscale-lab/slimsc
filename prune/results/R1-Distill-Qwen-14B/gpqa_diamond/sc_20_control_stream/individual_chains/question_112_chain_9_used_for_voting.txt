Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which means they form an orthonormal basis. So, the first thing I think is, I should probably normalize this state to find the actual coefficients.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so I need to find the normalization constant. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). To normalize, I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself and set it to 1.

The inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i) because the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero. Let me calculate each term. 

(1+i)(1-i) is 1 - i^2 which is 1 - (-1) = 2. 

(2-i)(2+i) is 4 + 2i - 2i - i², which simplifies to 4 + (2i-2i) + 1 (since i² is -1, so -i² is +1). So 4 + 0 +1=5.

Adding these gives 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with two states (up and down). So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

So the matrix looks like:
[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

This is an interesting operator. I think this is similar to the Pauli X matrix but scaled. The Pauli X matrix has 1s off the diagonal and 0s on diagonal. But here, the elements are ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. But wait, let's confirm. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply each element by ħ/2, you get the given A_ij.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and often used for spin-½ systems. So this operator would be (ħ/2) σ_x. Alternatively, since the Pauli matrix σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, multiplying by ħ/2 would give eigenvalues of ± ħ/2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So I need to find the eigenstates of this operator and then find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the expectation value as well, but let me focus on the probabilities first.

Wait, the operator matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. Let me think about its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For a 2x2 matrix like this, the eigenvalues λ can be found by solving the equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix is [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]. The determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ² /4 → λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Hmm, the eigenstates will probably be |+x> and |-x> since the Pauli X matrix eigenstates are those. So the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. Therefore, the operator corresponds to the spin in the x-direction multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2) S_x, perhaps.

Wait, the spin operator S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. So any state can be expressed as a combination of these.

So the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis (|up> and |down>), and I need to write it in the x-basis (|+x> and |-x>), then the coefficients would give the probabilities.

So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the probabilities directly by taking the overlap of |alpha> with each eigenstate of the operator.

Wait, let me think. The operator has eigenvalues λ = ± ħ/2, and the corresponding eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for -ħ/2.

So I need to find |< +x | alpha >|^2 and |< -x | alpha >|^2.

So I need the expressions for |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>.

I remember that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The spin-up along x is a superposition of |up> and |down> in the z basis. The correct expressions are:

|+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/√2
|-x> = (|↑> − |↓>)/√2

Yes, that's right. Because measuring spin up in x direction gives |+x>, which is an equal superposition of |up> and |down>.

So, to find < +x | alpha >, I can compute the inner product.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So when I compute this inner product, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and <up|down> is zero, as they are orthonormal.

So this simplifies to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2-i)/sqrt(7)*1 ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) ].

Wait, 1 +2 is 3. i -i is 0. So numerator is 3.

So < +x | alpha > is (3)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but wait: 1+i +2-i = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 +0=3.

So yes, it's 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 as one of the probabilities.

Wait, but let me check the other eigenstate as well. Because the probabilities should sum to 1.

The other eigenstate is |-x> which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product < -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So that's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> - (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

Because <up|down> is zero.

So this becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, let me compute (1+i) - (2 - i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 + 2i.

So [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] is (-1 + 2i).

So the inner product is ( (-1 + 2i) ) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

The absolute square is |(-1 +2i)|^2 / (2*7) = (1 +4 ) /14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So the probabilities are approx 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait: 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So the first two parts of the answer are 9/14 and 5/14, which match option A (0.64 and 0.36) as the first two numbers.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. Hmm.

Now, the average value of the operator. The average value is calculated as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is an operator, the expectation value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, another approach is to note that the operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Since the Pauli X matrix has eigenvalues ±1, the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9 -5) ħ/2 ] /14 = (4 ħ/2 ) /14 = (2 ħ ) /14 = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36), and the average is ħ/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value calculation using the operator matrix.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [(1+i), (2-i)]^T divided by sqrt(7).

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So A |alpha> would be [ (ħ/2)*(2-i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Then, < alpha | A | alpha > is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A |alpha>.

The conjugate of |alpha> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the product is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)*(2-i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which is [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] * (ħ/2) / 7.

Compute each term:

(1-i)(2-i): 2 -i -2i + i² = 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

(2+i)(1+i): 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i² = 2 +3i -1=1 +3i.

Adding these two: (1-3i) + (1+3i) ) = 2.

So the numerator is 2 * ħ/2 = ħ.

Divided by 7: ħ/7.

So the average is indeed ħ/7.

So all the calculations add up. The probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are orthonormal eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator with matrix representation A, where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of the operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The state |α⟩ is given as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, compute the inner product:
\[
\langle α | α \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), and the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Operator matrix and eigenstates
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|+x⟩\) and \(|-x⟩\) are given by the squared magnitudes of the overlaps:
\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | α \rangle|^2, \quad P(-x) = |\langle -x | α \rangle|^2.
\]
Compute \(\langle +x | α \rangle\):
\[
\langle +x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \langle up | up \rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \langle down | up \rangle \right].
\]
Since \(\langle up | up \rangle = 1\) and \(\langle down | up \rangle = 0\), this simplifies to:
\[
\langle +x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1+i + 2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]
Similarly, compute \(\langle -x | α \rangle\):
\[
\langle -x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \langle up | up \rangle - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \langle down | down \rangle \right].
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\langle -x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of the operator
The expectation value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α | A | α \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of A and the normalized state |α⟩, compute:
\[
A |α⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \\
\frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix}
2-i \\
1+i
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The inner product \(\langle α | A | α \rangle\) is:
\[
\langle α | A | α \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \left[ \frac{1-i}{\sqrt{7}}(2-i) + \frac{2+i}{\sqrt{7}}(1+i) \right].
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle α | A | α \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right].
\]
Compute each term:
\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 2 - 3i - 1 = 1 - 3i,
\]
\[
(2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i.
\]
Adding these gives:
\[
1 - 3i + 1 + 3i = 2.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2\sqrt{7}} \cdot 2 = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is \(\hbar/7\). These match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
