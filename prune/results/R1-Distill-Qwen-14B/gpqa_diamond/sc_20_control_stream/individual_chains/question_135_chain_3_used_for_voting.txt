Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the decay of a boson X, and I need to find out which options are kinematically allowed.

First, the problem gives me the Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian looks like this: L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(ψ_f(y))(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, actually, the user wrote it as \mathcal{L}(y) = -λ f f̄(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems a bit off. Maybe it's supposed to be something else. Oh, perhaps it's \mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}_f (y) (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m_f - \lambda_f X(y)) \psi_f(y). No, wait, perhaps the interaction term is the one involving X. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the interaction is L = -λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f, meaning that X couples to fermions with charge, maybe like a Yukawa coupling.

But perhaps the exact form isn't crucial for finding the possible decays. The key point is that the boson X interacts with fermions. The question is about the possible decay channels of X. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Now, the mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So for a decay X → f f̄ to be possible kinematically, the mass of X must be at least twice the rest mass of the fermion f. So I need to check which fermions have a rest mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Let me list all the known fermion masses. Wait, let's think about the masses of the quarks and leptons.

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2-5 MeV (but current algebra gives like 2 MeV, but varies)
- Down (d): similar, ~3-6 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV
Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So the X boson is 6 GeV. So 6 GeV /2 = 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Let me go through each possible fermion:

Electron (e): 0.511 MeV → definitely allowed. So X can decay to e+ e-.

Muon (μ): 105.7 MeV → allowed.

Tau (τ): 1.78 GeV → allowed.

Quarks:

u: ~2 MeV → allowed.

d: ~3-6 MeV → if the mass is under 3 GeV, which it is. So u, d, s, c. Wait, wait. Wait, the mass of the strange quark is around 95-100 MeV, so that's under 3 GeV. So s is allowed.

Charm quark (c) is about 1.5 GeV. So 1.5 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay to c c-bar.

Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV. So 4.5 GeV is more than half of X's mass (3 GeV). So X cannot decay into b b-bar because 6 GeV is less than 2 * 4.5 GeV (which is 9 GeV). So b is out.

Top quark is way too heavy, so no.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are:

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay pairs are:

e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e. So includes b, which is too heavy. So A is not correct.

Option B: X→ c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So includes c, which is allowed. This looks good.

Option C: includes c, also t. But t is too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair:

c c-bar: each c is ~1.5 GeV. So 2 *1.5 =3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV → allowed.

s s-bar: 2* ~100 MeV = 200 MeV → allowed.

u u-bar: ~4 MeV → allowed.

d d-bar: ~6 MeV → allowed.

tau: 2 *1.78 = 3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6, so allowed.

mu: 2*105.7 MeV is 211.4 MeV → allowed.

e: negligible → allowed.

So X can decay into all of these except for b and t.

Looking at options, option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's all the allowed ones. So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays \( X \to f\bar{f} \) are allowed if the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the rest mass of the fermion \( f \). For \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, the maximum rest mass of \( f \) is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). 

### Fermion Masses:
- **Quarks**:  
  - \( u \): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( d \): \( 3 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( s \): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( c \): \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)  
  - \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)  
- **Leptons**:  
  - \( e \): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( \mu \): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)  

### Allowed Decays:
- \( e^+e^- \): Allowed (mass \( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( \mu^+\mu^- \): Allowed (mass \( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( \tau^+\tau^- \): Allowed (mass \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} < 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( u\bar{u} \): Allowed (mass \( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( d\bar{d} \): Allowed (mass \( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( s\bar{s} \): Allowed (mass \( 95 \, \text{MeV} < 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( c\bar{c} \): Allowed (mass \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV} < 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( b\bar{b} \): Forbidden (mass \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
- \( t\bar{t} \): Forbidden (mass \( 173 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).  

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden.  
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden.  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden.  

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.
