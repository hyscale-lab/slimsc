Okay, so I have this physics problem here about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. I need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two states. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy and time. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes it's written with a factor of π/2 or something else, but maybe for this problem, the exact factor isn't crucial since it's a multiple-choice question.

So the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the lifetime Δt. A longer lifetime (more precise energy measurement) would give a smaller uncertainty in energy. So, the energy difference between the two states needs to be greater than the uncertainty to be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait. The lifetime here—what's the relation? Each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So both states have their own lifetimes. But the problem states that we want to clearly distinguish them, so perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in either of them.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE = ħ / (2Δt), or something like that. Let me compute the minimum energy difference needed so that their energies don't overlap in measurement.

Let me compute the uncertainty for each state. 

The lifetimes are t1 = 10^-9 seconds and t2 = 10^-8 seconds.

So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2*t1)
Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2*t2)

Wait, but which one should I take? Because the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, I think. Because if ΔE is smaller than the larger ΔE, then perhaps the states would not resolve.

Wait, let me think. Suppose E2 is higher than E1. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1. To distinguish, this ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty, which is the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because the uncertainties set the minimum detectable difference.

Wait, but since t1 is smaller than t2 (1e-9 vs 1e-8 s), that means ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2. Because ΔE is inversely proportional to time. So for E1, ΔE1 is larger.

So the required energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than ΔE1. Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the energies can be distinguished.

Wait, let me compute it. Let's calculate each ΔE.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for t1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2*t1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.05457e-34)/(2e-9) ≈ 5.27285e-26 J.

Convert that to eV because the options are in eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE1 (eV) = 5.27285e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So about 3.3e-7 eV.

Similarly for t2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2*t2) = (1.05457e-34)/(2e-8) ≈ 5.27285e-27 J.

In eV: 5.27285e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV. So about 3.3e-8 eV.

So the larger of the two uncertainties is ΔE1 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be greater than this value to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is smaller than 3.3e-7 eV. So this is too small; the states wouldn't be resolved.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → much larger than 3.3e-7. So this is adequate.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, while 3.3e-7 is 0.33e-6. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.3e-7, meaning it's below the required. So option C is the only one that's larger than the required uncertainty.

Wait, wait. Let me check the numbers again. I might have miscalculated.

Wait, 3.3e-7 eV is 0.33e-6 eV. So any option larger than this would work.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger. So that's definitely larger than 3.3e-7.

Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 3.3e-7. So that's not enough.

So the correct answer must be option C.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, which is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime, so the state with the shorter lifetime (\( t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)) has a larger energy uncertainty.

### Calculations:
1. For \( t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). To distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than this value.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is also much smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think it through.

So the required energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than ΔE1. Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the energies can be distinguished.

Wait, let me compute it. Let's calculate each ΔE.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for t1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2*t1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.05457e-34)/(2e-9) ≈ 5.27285e-26 J.

Convert that to eV because the options are in eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE1 (eV) = 5.27285e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So about 3.3e-7 eV.

Similarly for t2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2*t2) = (1.05457e-34)/(2e-8) ≈ 5.27285e-27 J.

In eV: 5.27285e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV. So about 3.3e-8 eV.

So the larger of the two uncertainties is ΔE1 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be greater than this value to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is smaller than 3.3e-7 eV. So this is too small; the states wouldn't be resolved.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, while 3.3e-7 is 0.33e-6. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.3e-7, meaning it's below the required. So option C is the only one that's larger than the required uncertainty.

Wait, wait. Let me check the numbers again. I might have miscalculated.

Wait, 3.3e-7 eV is 0.33e-6 eV. So any option larger than this would work.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger. So that's definitely larger than 3.3e-7.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, which is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime, so the state with the shorter lifetime (\( t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)) has a larger energy uncertainty.

### Calculations:
1. For \( t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). To distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than this value.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is also much smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
