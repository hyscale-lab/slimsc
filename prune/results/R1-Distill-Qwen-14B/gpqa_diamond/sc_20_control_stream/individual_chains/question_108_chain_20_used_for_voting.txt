Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember from my studies that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to the electrons' spin, right?

The problem states that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Also, we're dealing with small m values, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -1, 0, +1 for a p-orbital, but maybe here it's considering small m in general, like m being small compared to other factors.

The main task is to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which would be the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition given has a wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm. I remember that this wavelength is in the visible spectrum, specifically the Balmer series of hydrogen transitions, probably the H-alpha line, which emits when an electron drops from n=3 to n=2.

First, I need to find the energy difference ΔE using the wavelength. Oh, right, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. So plugging in the numbers, let's calculate ΔE.

Wait, λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers, so 486.1e-9 meters. Let me compute that:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m)
= (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 486.1e-9
Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Now divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approximately 4.088e-18 J.

Wait, but I think energy in atomic units is often expressed in eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So dividing 4.088e-18 J by 1.602e-19 J/eV gives about 25.5 eV. But wait, that can't be right because the transition from n=3 to n=2 in hydrogen is about 1.89 eV. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1e-9 meters, right. So 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 486.1e-9 is 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = let me compute this. 1.9878e-25 /4.861e-7 = (1.9878 /4.861) * 1e-18. 1.9878/4.861 is roughly 0.409. So 0.409e-18 J is 4.09e-19 J. Converting to eV: 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈2.55 eV. Hmm, but I thought the Balmer transition (n=3 to n=2) is about 1.89 eV. Maybe I'm confusing the series. Oh wait, the Balmer series starts at n=2, so transitions from higher levels to n=2. The n=3 to n=2 transition is indeed around 1.89 eV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the wavelength. Let's think about the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant is about 1.097e4 m^-1. The wavelength for the transition from n1=2 to n=3 is 1/λ = R*(1/(n1)^2 - 1/(n2)^2) = R*(1/4 - 1/9) = R*(5/36). So R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. 5/(36) is about 0.1389. So 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.53e3 m^-1. So λ is 1/1.53e3 ≈6.53e-4 m, which is 653 nm. Hmm, but the given λ is 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line. Oh wait, H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, which gives 656 nm, but the given λ is 486, which is H-beta (n=4 to n=2), which has a higher energy. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the Balmer series transitions. The Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So the first transition is n=3→2 (λ=656 nm,  red), then n=4→2 (486 nm, blue-green, H-alpha?), wait no, I think H-alpha is n=6→3. Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation. I think my initial calculation resulted in about 25 eV, but that can't be right because typical hydrogen transitions are in eV scale (like 10 eV at most). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me recalculate. 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1e-9 meters. So 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = (1.9878 /486.1) * 1e-16. Because 1e-25 / 1e-9 =1e-16. So 1.9878/486.1 is approximately 0.00409. So 0.00409e-16 J is 4.09e-19 J. Converting to eV: 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but I thought the Balmer series transition from n=3 to n=2 is about 1.89 eV, which corresponds to a longer wavelength (656 nm). The given wavelength is 486 nm, which is bluer, so higher energy. So that would correspond to n=4→2, which is 486 nm. Let me check the Rydberg formula: 1/λ = R*(1/(2)^2 -1/(4)^2 )= R*(1/4 -1/16) = R*(3/16) =1.097e4 *3/16≈ 2055 m^-1. So 1/2055≈0.000486 m →486e-6 m, which matches. So yes, n=4→2 is 486 nm and the energy is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term... what's that term? The paramagnetic term arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron (due to its spin) and the external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the g-factor (approximately 2 for electrons), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but in this problem, m refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number, not spin. Oh, wait, the problem says for small m, which is the orbital quantum number. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -l, ..., +l. For the hydrogen atom, the orbital angular momentum is L, and m_L can be from -l to +l. For an s orbital, l=0, m=0. p orbitals have l=1, m=-1,0,+1, etc. But since m is small, perhaps it's considering m=0 or small m. Wait, but the paramagnetic term is due to spin, not orbital angular momentum. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, paramagnetic coupling is usually about the spin-orbit interaction. Or is it about the orbital magnetic moment in a magnetic field? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term in the Hamiltonian is typically the Zeeman term, which is due to the interaction between the magnetic moment (which arises from orbital angular momentum and spin) and the external magnetic field. So for an electron in an atom in a magnetic field B, the Hamiltonian is H = μ·B. But the magnetic moment μ is a combination of the orbital magnetic moment and the spin magnetic moment: μ = μ_orbital + μ_spin.

But in this question, I think the paramagnetic coupling refers to the spin-orbit interaction, or perhaps the Zeeman effect due to the spin. Wait, no, the paramagnetic effect is usually due to the spin's magnetic moment. So perhaps the coupling term is the spin's interaction with the magnetic field. So the term would be H = -μ_B * g_s * m_s * B, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number (which can be ±1/2).

Wait, but the problem states that m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, perhaps the paramagnetic term here is the orbital contribution. So the orbital magnetic moment is given by L_z = m * ħ, and μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L_z)/ħ = (e)/(2m_e) * m. So μ = (e/(2m_e)) * m. Then the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B = - (e/(2m_e)) * m * B.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on this. Alternatively, the paramagnetic term could be the contribution from the spin, which is H = -g μ_B m_s B, where m_s is ±1/2. Since the problem says m is small, perhaps it's considering m=0, but that's for orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, for spin, m_s can't be zero. Hmm, perhaps the problem is mixing up m terms, but maybe for this question, we can proceed assuming that the paramagnetic term is proportional to m, which is small.

So, the paramagnetic coupling energy term would be something like H = something * m * B. Let's compute this. Let's say H is proportional to m * B. The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e). So the energy is H = μ_B * m * B. Wait, but m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is an integer. For example, for an s orbital, l=0, m=0. For p, m can be -1, 0, +1. So for small m, m could be 0, which would give H=0. But that can't be, because that would make the term zero, which would not be comparable to ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic term refers to the spin magnetic quantum number. Then, m_s can be ±1/2. So H = -g μ_B B m_s. Then the expectation value would be proportional to m_s. So for each electron, the possible values are ±1/2. But in any case, the magnitude would be proportional to (1/2) * g μ_B B.

But let's get back. Let me think about the order of magnitude. The paramagnetic term's expectation value would be H_param = μ_B * B * m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Since m is small, perhaps m is of order 1, like m=0, ±1. So let me compute the magnitude of H_param.

μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So H_param = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * m. But m can be 0, ±1, ±2, etc., depending on the orbital. Wait, but since m is small, maybe m=1. So H_param ≈9.274e-24 J *1 =9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but earlier I calculated ΔE as about 4.09e-19 J, which is 4.09e-19 J. So comparing 9.274e-24 J (H_param) to 4.09e-19 J (ΔE), H_param is much smaller. Because 9.274e-24 is about 2e-5 times 4e-19. So H_param << ΔE.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 = (9.274 /4.09) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27 * 1e-5 = 2.27e-5. So H_param is about 2e-5 times ΔE, which is way smaller. So H_param << ΔE.

But wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the units or the expression for H_param. Let me double-check. The orbital magnetic dipole moment is given by μ = (μ_B) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number (so for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1). The energy in the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. So H = -μ_B * m * B. So the expectation value would be μ_B * B * m, but since m is small, say m=1, the energy is about 9.274e-24 J *1 *1 T =9.274e-24 J.

In contrast, the transition energy ΔE is about 4.09e-19 J. So the ratio is 9.274e-24 /4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 2e-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE.

So the expectation value of the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

But wait, the question says 'paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE'. So the paramagnetic term is the Hamiltonian term, and ΔE is the transition energy. So the question is, is the expectation value of H_param much larger, much smaller, or comparable to ΔE?

In this case, 9.274e-24 J is much smaller than 4e-19 J. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the correct option is C.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energies.

### Step 1: Compute the transition energy ΔE
The transition energy is related to the wavelength of the emitted photon by the equation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength of the transition).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} = 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.09 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the paramagnetic coupling term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment is proportional to the orbital magnetic quantum number \( m \), and the energy is given by:

\[
\langle H_{\text{paramagnetic}} \rangle = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B,
\]

where:
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton),
- \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small, e.g., \( m = 0, \pm 1 \)),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field strength).

For \( m = 1 \) (the largest small value of \( m \)):

\[
\langle H_{\text{paramagnetic}} \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare the two energies
To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy:

\[
\frac{\langle H_{\text{paramagnetic}} \rangle}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

This shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( 2.27 \times 10^{-5} \) times the transition energy, which is much smaller.

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \). Therefore, the correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \)**

Answer: C
