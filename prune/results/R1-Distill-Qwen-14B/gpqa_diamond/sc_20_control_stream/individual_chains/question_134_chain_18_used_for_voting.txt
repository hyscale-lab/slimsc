Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value for strong acids and bases is around -57 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure if that's the same here because there are multiple acids and bases involved.

Wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I need to figure out which are the acids and which are the bases. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too (though it's diprotic, so it might donate two H+ ions), and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. 

So, when mixed, the acids will react with the base. But wait, how do they react? I think each acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will provide OH- ions. The neutralization reaction will produce water and possibly some salt.

But wait, the problem mixes all three solutions together. Let me write out the possible reactions.

HCl is a monoprotic acid; it donates one H+. H2SO4 is diprotic, so it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each molecule provides two OH- ions because it's Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

So the total H+ from the acids and total OH- from the base will determine how much neutralization occurs. The limiting reagent will decide how much heat is released.

Let me compute the moles of each:

HCl: volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 1 H+, so 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Since it's diprotic, it can donate 2 H+ per molecule. So total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but neutralization reactions are between H+ and OH-. So total H+ available is from both HCl and H2SO4. Let me sum them.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent is OH- because 0.28 mol H+ can react with 0.2 mol OH- to form 0.2 mol H2O. There will be some excess H+ left: 0.08 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. H2SO4 as a strong acid would dissociate completely. So that's fine. But Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it also dissociates completely. So the calculations are correct.

So the reaction will proceed until all OH- is used up, or all H+ is used up. In this case, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28, so OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is typically calculated per mole of H2O formed. For strong acid and strong base, it's about -57 kJ per mole of H2O. Let me confirm that: yes, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately -57 kJ/mol, because it's the formation of water from H+ and OH-.

So the heat released would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, my calculation is -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16 kJ, which is higher. What did I miss?

Hmm, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it donates both H+ ions, maybe each contributes to the neutralization.

Wait, when H2SO4 donates two H+ ions, each can react with OH-.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the stoichiometry more carefully. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me recheck the calculations.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each contributes one H+. So 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each can donate two H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

Limit is OH-: 0.2 mol.

So neutralization produces 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ if converted. Wait, no. Because 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, wait, the options have some in kcal and others in kJ. So perhaps I'm supposed to calculate in kcal.

Wait, because I got -11.4 kJ, which is roughly -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal because 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ.

Wait, 2.72 kcal would be approximately 11.4 kJ. So that's option A, but no, because the calculation gave me 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol. But wait, the sign: if it's exothermic, it's negative.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometric calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces more than one mole of water per mole of acid and base.

Wait another thought: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

The H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because when a strong acid reacts with a strong base, the neutralization forms water and a salt. In this case, the neutralization products would be BaSO4 and water.

Wait, but the HCl is another strong acid. So perhaps I need to consider all possible reactions.

Wait, maybe I should consider the reaction between the acids and the base. So the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But another possibility is that the H2SO4 could react with Ba(OH)2 in a specific stoichiometric ratio.

Wait, let me think about the possible reactions.

First, let's write the neutralization reactions separately.

When HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But since HCl is monoprotic, each HCl donates one H+. Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- per formula unit.

So the balanced equation would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Because each H2SO4 donates two H+ and Ba(OH)2 provides two OH-.

So in the problem, the three solutions are mixed, so both HCl and H2SO4 are reacting with Ba(OH)2.

So perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ from both acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then find the limiting reagent.

That's what I did earlier. So total H+ = 0.28 mol, OH- = 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol of H2O is formed.

Wait, but wait another thing: each mole of H+ reacting with OH- produces one mole of H2O. So 0.2 moles of H2O, each with an enthalpy change of -57 kJ/mol.

So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is different. Wait, but the standard value is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acid and strong base.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Correct.

So the moles are correct.

Wait, but the problem is when mixing all three, perhaps the neutralization isn't just H+ and OH- reacting. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, maybe it can donate two H+ per mole, but maybe the stoichiometry is different when reacting with Ba(OH)2 which provides two OH-.

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions:

HCl (H+) + Ba(OH)2 (OH-) → BaCl2 + H2O.

Each HCl provides one H+, each Ba(OH)2 provides two OH-.

So the reaction would require 2 HCl for each Ba(OH)2.

Similarly, H2SO4 (2 H+) + Ba(OH)2 (2 OH-) → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would react in a 1:1 ratio.

So perhaps the neutralization between these is more than just H+ and OH-.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate each reaction separately.

Let me approach it this way.

First, calculate how much Ba(OH)2 is available: 0.1 mol.

Calculate how much HCl is available: 0.1 mol.

Calculate how much H2SO4 is available: 0.09 mol.

Now, in the case of HCl and Ba(OH)2:

They react in a 2:1 ratio.

So for each 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of HCl are needed.

So with 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, it would require 0.2 mol HCl.

But we only have 0.1 mol HCl. So HCl is the limiting reagent here.

So the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be:

HCl: 0.1 mol → reacts with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2.

This would produce 0.05 mol BaCl2 and 0.05 mol H2O.

Wait, no. Because the reaction is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → products. So 2 moles HCl react with 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

So 0.1 mol HCl can react with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.05 mol BaCl2 and 0.1 mol H2O.

Wait, no, the products from the reaction are 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So 2 HCl → 2 H+ and 2 Cl-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

Reaction: 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O. So 2 HCl provides 2 H+, Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of HCl are needed.

So with 0.1 mol HCl, it can react with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.05 mol H2O.

Wait, no, because each Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH- and each HCl produces 1 H+. So 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → products.

The H+ and OH- neutralize: 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O (so 2 H2O molecules, each from one H+ and one OH-).

So the reaction produces 2 H2O per Ba(OH)2 and 2 HCl.

So 0.1 mol HCl can only react with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2.

So, after this reaction, HCl is all used up (0.1 mol), and Ba(OH)2 remaining is 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Now, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 mol, which can react with H2SO4.

H2SO4 is 0.09 mol.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1, producing BaSO4 and 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 donates 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 donates 2 OH-, so they react in a 1:1 ratio.

So with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 and 0.09 mol H2SO4, the Ba(OH)2 is the limiting reagent.

So 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 will react with 0.05 mol H2SO4, producing 0.05 mol BaSO4 and 0.1 mol H2O.

So total H2O produced is from both reactions: 0.05 mol (from HCl) + 0.1 mol (from H2SO4) = 0.15 mol.

Wait, but wait. The H2O from the HCl reaction comes from 2 H+ (from HCl) and 2 OH- (from Ba(OH)2), leading to 2 H2O. So for 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 reacting with HCl, it's 0.05 mol of the reaction, which produces 0.1 mol H2O.

Similarly, the reaction with H2SO4 produces 0.05 mol of the reaction, leading to 0.1 mol H2O again.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate this.

Wait, when HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So for 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles HCl are used, producing 2 moles H2O.

So 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 reacting with HCl would produce 0.1 mol H2O.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 mol, which reacts with H2SO4 as follows:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, 1 mole H2SO4 is consumed, producing 2 moles H2O.

So 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 will produce 0.1 mol H2O.

So total H2O is 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol.

So the total moles of H2O produced is 0.2.

Which matches the initial approach when considering H+ and OH-.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 moles of H2O formed, each at -57 kJ/mol. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, maybe the enthalpy per mole is different. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, perhaps each H+ contributes, but maybe the enthalpy is a bit different for each mole. Or perhaps I should use a different value for the enthalpy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or per mole of base, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy change for the entire reaction, including the possible heat from the mixing.

Wait, but the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the heat released per mole of water formed.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is considering the total heat released, so perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options have a different unit.

Looking back, the options include both kcal and kJ.

Wait, my calculation is -11.4 kJ, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Let's see what -11.4 kJ is in kcal.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ ≈ 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but that's not right because 0.2 * 57 is 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 kJ, but converting that to kcal would be 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy would be approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was -11.4 kJ, which would be option D if it were present, but the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Only D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the total H+ is 0.28 mol, but the OH- is 0.2 mol. So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2 mol, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, releasing 57 kJ per mole.

So total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is in the way I considered the H2SO4.

Wait, wait, maybe the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H+.

Wait, but I already accounted for that. So 0.09 mol of H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total heat in calories, not kilojoules.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57,000 cal/mol, because 1 kJ is about 239 cal.

Wait, no, wait: 1 kJ = 1000 J = 239.006 cal (since 1 cal = 4.184 J).

So, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. In calories, that's 57,000 / 4.184 ≈ 13,600 cal, or 13.6 kcal.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 kJ is approximately 239 cal.

Wait, no: 1 cal = 4.184 J → 1 kJ = 1000 J = 1000 / 4.184 ≈ 239.006 cal.

So 57 kJ = 57 * 239.006 ≈ 13,643 cal → 13.643 kcal.

So per mole of H2O, it's about -13.643 kcal.

Wait, but I thought the standard value was -57 kJ/mol, which is approximately -13.6 kcal/mol.

So, if I have 0.2 mol, 0.2 * (-13.643) ≈ -2.728 kcal.

Which is about -2.73 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought the total H2O was 0.2 mol, so the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is correct.

But looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would correspond to 0.2 * 57,000 cal/mol, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Let me clarify.

If the enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ, and we have 0.2 mol, the total is -11.4 kJ, which is -11,400 J.

To convert to kcal: since 1 kcal = 4184 J, so -11,400 J = -11,400 / 4184 ≈ -2.72 kcal. So option A.

Alternatively, if the calculation was done in kcal per mole, with the standard value being approximately -13.6 kcal/mol (since 57,000 cal is about 13.6 kcal), then 0.2 mol would be 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct answer was -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal, so option A is correct.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.42 *4.184 ≈ -47.8 kJ. That's way higher than our calculation.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each HCl molecule contributes 1 H⁺, so total H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each H₂SO₄ molecule contributes 2 H⁺, so total H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ molecule contributes 2 OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent since it is present in smaller quantity.

3. **Calculate moles of water formed:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) shows a 1:1 molar ratio between H⁺ and OH⁻.  
   - Since 0.2 mol of OH⁻ is limiting, 0.2 mol of H₂O is formed.

4. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it is inconsistent with the standard enthalpy of neutralization.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match any valid calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
