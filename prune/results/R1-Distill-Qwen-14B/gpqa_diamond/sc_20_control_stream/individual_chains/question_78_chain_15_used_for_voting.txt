Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The setup involves vectors r (the observation point), d (the vector from where the field was generated to r), and v (the velocity of the charge at the field-generating instant).

I remember that when charges are moving, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But the potentials are related to these fields. The scalar potential is associated with the electric field, and the vector potential with the magnetic field.

Let me think about the expressions for V and A. For a static charge, the scalar potential V is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the potential is measured. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the motion's effects on the fields.

Wait, but the options given here don't seem to include any time derivatives or anything like that. So maybe we're looking at the potentials in the context of the retarded time or something like that.

Wait, no, the question states that the potentials at time t, considering the field generated at time tr, which is earlier. So the fields at time tr affect the potentials at time t.

I recall that the scalar potential due to a moving charge can be written using the Liénard potentials. The general form for the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t_r)/c²)] ), where t_r is the retarded time, but I'm not entirely sure of the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: the scalar potential V arises from the electric field, so it's based on the charge's position and velocity. The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field generated by the moving charge.

The vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × r̂) / (r c²) ), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the options include some expressions with v² and v in them. Let's look at the options.

Option A: V is the static case, and A is (v²/c²) V. That seems odd because A is a vector and v squared would be a scalar, but that would make A a vector scaled by a scalar. But I don't think that's the case. Also, in reality, A should involve velocity terms, but perhaps not just v squared.

Option B: V is static, A is v/(c²) times V. So A is a vector proportional to v, which makes sense because the magnetic field (and hence A) comes from motion. But let's think in terms of units. If V has units of volts (J/C), then A has units of T·m (since B is Tesla and A is the vector potential). Let me check the units.

Wait, the SI units might help. V is in volts (kg·m²/(s³·A·m)). A is in ampere-seconds per meter (H/m, which is (s²·kg/(A²·m³)) ). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

Option C: V has a denominator of (d c - d · v). Wait, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), right? So the denominator is (d c - (d · v)). So the term (d c - d · v) would be c times the distance minus the projection of velocity along d. That makes sense because it's the denominator in the Liénard expression for the scalar potential, maybe?

Similarly, for the vector potential in option C, it has μ₀ q c v over 4 pi times (d c - d·v). The numerator is μ₀ q c v, and the denominator is (d c - d·v). So that could fit with A being proportional to v and the denominator being similar to the denominator in V.

Option D: the denominator is (d c + d · v). Hmm, that seems different. The sign might matter depending on the direction of the terms. Wait, the denominator for the scalar potential in Maxwell's equations when considering retarded time usually has a term like c t - r · v, but I'm not sure how that translates here.

Wait, another approach: The general expression for the scalar potential V due to a moving charge includes a term that accounts for the charge's velocity. The formula is approximately V(r, t) = [q/(4πε₀)] * [1/(r - (v tr)/c²)] where tr is the retarded time. But perhaps in terms of the vector d, which is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr). But how does that tie into the denominator?

Wait, the denominator in the Liénard potentials is d c - (d · v). Because d = r - s(tr), and s(tr) is the position at time tr. So the denominator would be d c minus (d · v). So I think option C's V is similar to that, except in option C, it's multiplied by c in the numerator. Wait, let me see: option C says V is (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v)]. Hmm, but in the standard V expression, it's just q/(4πε₀ ...) without the c. So that's confusing.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. The standard expression for the scalar potential when considering the retarded time is:

V(r, t) = ( q / (4πε₀) ) * ( 1 / ( |d| - (d · v)/(c²) ) )

Wait, no, maybe more accurately, the denominator is (r - (v t_r)) where t_r is the retarded time. But perhaps in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), and s(tr) is the position of the charge at tr, which is s(tr) ≈ s(0) + v tr, assuming v is constant? Or not, because the trajectory might be more complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the general form. The scalar potential V is given by the expression involving the charge and the reciprocal of the distance, adjusted for the motion. The vector potential A is proportional to the velocity of the charge. So looking at the options, option C's A has μ₀ q c v in the numerator, and the denominator matches that of V (d c - d·v). Similarly, option D's denominator is (d c + d·v), which might have a different sign.

Wait, let's think about the direction. The denominator in the scalar potential is (d c - d · v). So if the charge is moving towards the observer, d · v would be positive, making the denominator smaller, so the potential larger, which makes sense because the moving charge would affect the field.

In the vector potential A, it's also using the same denominator, so options C and D are the only ones that have the same denominator in both V and A.

Wait, but the options for V and A in the choices: let's see.

Option C:
V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v))
A = (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - d·v))

Option D:
V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + d·v))
A = (μ₀ q v) / (4π (d c + d·v)) [Wait, no, checking the option again: D's A is (mu_o q c v) over (d c + d·v), same denominator as V.]

Wait, I think the standard form for the potentials is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(r - (v t_r) ) ]

But in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), and s(tr) is the position at time tr. If we assume that tr is the time when the field was generated, then s(tr) is the position at that time, and the velocity v is the velocity at time tr.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, we have (d c - d · v), which comes from considering the motion of the charge. So the expressions for V and A would have this term in the denominator.

Now, looking at the vector potential A, it's typically given by (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × r̂) / r, but I'm not sure about the exact form when considering the motion and retarded time.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's velocity. The vector potential A is generally proportional to the velocity of the charge. So in the options, which ones have A proportional to v?

Options B and C (and D): option B has A proportional to v, option C has A proportional to v, and D as well.

So, if the vector potential is proportional to v, then the correct option must have A proportional to v.

But let's look at the expressions. Option C's A is (mu_o q c v) / (4 pi (d c - d·v)), while option D's A is (mu_o q c v) / (4 pi (d c + d·v)).

So the denominator is either (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). Which one is correct?

Wait, the denominator comes from the expression for the scalar potential. If the scalar potential is V = q c/(4 pi eps0 (d c - d·v)), then that's the denominator. So the denominator in A would be the same as in V.

Wait, but why is there a c in the numerator of V? Because in the standard scalar potential, V is q/(4 pi eps0 r), so if V has a c in the numerator, perhaps it's scaled by c.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the units.

The scalar potential V's unit is volts (V). The denominator in option C's V is [d c - d·v]. Since d is a distance (unit m), c is m/s, so d c has units m²/s. Similarly, d·v is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So the denominator has units m²/s, which would make the entire denominator in V have units m²/s. So the numerator is q c (C·m/s) divided by (m²/s), so (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m).

But the standard V has units (C/(4 pi eps0)) * (1/r), which is (C/(m)) as 1/r is 1/m. So option C's V's numerator has q c, so the units would be (C * m/s ) / ( m²/s ) = C/(m). Which matches the units of V. So that seems correct.

Similarly, the vector potential A has units T·m (tesla·meter). Let's compute the units for option C's A: (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - d·v)). The denominator in A is same as V, units m²/s.

Numerator: mu0 [H/m] * q [C] * c [m/s] * v [m/s] = (H * C * m²/s²). H is H = V·s/A = (kg·m²/(A² s³)) ) * s / A = kg·m²/(A² s²) ). So H·C = kg·m²/(A s²) ). Then multiply by m²/s²: kg·m^4/(A s^4 ).

Denominator: m²/s.

So overall, (kg·m^4/(A s^4 )) ) / (m²/s) ) = kg·m²/(A s^3 )

But Tesla is kg/(s² A), so T·m = (kg/(s² A)) * m = kg·m/(s² A). Comparing with the computed units: kg·m²/(A s^3 ) is not matching Tesla·meter. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in unit calculation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: What's the unit of A? It's in Weber per square meter (Wb/m²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since A is the vector potential, its units should be such that when you take the curl, you get B (tesla), which has units kg/(s² A).

Wait, the unit of A is Tesla·meter (T·m). So, let's see: mu0 is H/m, which is H/m = (V·s/A)/m = (kg·m²/(A² s³)) * s / (A m) ) = kg·m/(A² s²).

So mu0 has units kg·m/(A² s²).

In option C's A: numerator is mu0 * q * c * v.

mu0: kg·m/(A² s²)
q: C = A·s
c: m/s
v: m/s

So mu0 * q * c * v = (kg·m/(A² s²)) ) * (A s) * (m/s) * (m/s) =
= (kg·m) * (A s) * m²/s² ) / (A² s²) )

Wait, let me compute the dimensions step by step:

mu0: kg·m/(A² s²)
q: A·s
c: m/s
v: m/s

Multiply together: (kg·m/(A² s²)) ) * (A s) ) = kg·m * (A s) / (A² s²) * m/(s) * m/s.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated, but perhaps it's better to think that option C's A is correctly scaled because in the standard expression, A is proportional to v, and the denominator matches that of V.

So looking back, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials when the charge is moving would involve terms that account for the motion, which appears in the denominator as (d c - d·v), as in option C.

But let me double-check. The scalar potential V is given by (q c)/(4 pi eps0 (dc - d·v)), and A is (mu0 q c v)/(4 pi (dc - d·v)). Does that make sense?

Wait, another thought: the potentials should depend on the speed of light, c, because electromagnetic effects propagate at c. So the denominator being (d c - d·v) accounts for the relative motion, which is part of the retardation effect. This makes sense because d is the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to the observation point. So if the charge is moving, the term d·v would adjust the effective distance the field has to travel.

So V and A in option C have the same denominator, which is correct. That leaves options C and D as possibilities, but D has a plus in the denominator, which may not account for the correct direction.

Wait, let's think about the direction. If the charge is moving towards the observer (so d is pointing towards the charge, and v is in the same direction as d), then d·v is positive. So the denominator becomes d c - (d·v). If d·v is large, the denominator is smaller, making V larger, which is consistent with the charge moving towards you, increasing the electric field and thus the potential.

So option C's denominator (d c - d·v) seems correct.

So the scalar potential in option C is V = (q c)/(4 pi eps0 (d c - d·v)), and A is (mu0 q c v)/(4 pi (d c - d·v)). That looks correct.

Wait a moment, but the standard scalar potential for a moving charge is (q/(4 pi eps0)) * [1/(r - (v t_r)))] where t_r is the retarded time. But in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), perhaps s(tr) is approximately the position of the charge at tr, so r = s(tr) + d. So t_r is the time it takes for the effect to reach the observer, which would be t_r = (|d|)/c. But if the charge is moving, this gets more complicated.

Alternatively, the expression for V would be (q c)/(4 pi eps0 (d c - d·v)), as in option C.

So putting it all together, I think option C is the correct one.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) due to a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the options provided. The scalar potential \( V \) is related to the electric field, while the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is related to the magnetic field. For a moving charge, the potentials are influenced by the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and the geometry of the problem.

### Key Observations:
1. **Option A**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given as the static case \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is correct for a stationary charge. However, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2/c^2 \), which is inconsistent with the standard form of \( \vec{A} \), as it should involve \( \vec{v} \) linearly. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: The scalar potential \( V \) is again the static case \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \). The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which aligns with the expected dependence on \( \vec{v} \). However, this option does not account for the motion of the charge in the denominator of the potentials, making it incomplete and inconsistent with the retarded time effects.

3. **Option C**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given as \( V = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). Here, the denominator \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) correctly accounts for the motion of the charge and the geometry of the problem. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) share the same denominator, which is consistent with the retarded time effects. This option is consistent with the Liénard potentials and the standard form of the electromagnetic potentials for a moving charge.

4. **Option D**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given as \( V = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). The denominator \( dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the standard form of the potentials, as it does not correctly account for the motion of the charge. This option is therefore incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the correct choice because it properly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion and the geometry of the problem in both the scalar and vector potentials. The denominator \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) aligns with the retarded time effects, and the expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are consistent with the Liénard potentials.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The setup involves vectors r (the observation point), d (the vector from where the field was generated to r), and v (the velocity of the charge at the field-generating instant).

I remember that when charges are moving, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But the potentials are related to these fields. The scalar potential is associated with the electric field, and the vector potential with the magnetic field.

Let me think about the expressions for V and A. For a static charge, the scalar potential V is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the potential is measured. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the motion's effects on the fields.

Wait, but the options given here don't seem to include any time derivatives or anything like that. So maybe we're looking at the potentials in the context of the retarded time or something like that.

Wait, no, the question states that the potentials at time t, considering the field generated at time tr, which is earlier. So the fields at time tr affect the potentials at time t.

I recall that the scalar potential due to a moving charge can be written using the Liénard potentials. The general form for the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t_r)/c²)] ), where t_r is the retarded time, but I'm not entirely sure of the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: the scalar potential V arises from the electric field, so it's based on the charge's position and velocity. The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field generated by the moving charge.

The vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v × r̂) / (r c²) ), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the options include some expressions with v² and v in them. Let's look at the options.

Option A: V is the static case, and A is (v²/c²) V. That seems odd because A is a vector and v squared would be a scalar, but that would make A a vector scaled by a scalar. But I don't think that's the case. Also, in reality, A should involve velocity terms, but perhaps not just v squared.

Option B: V is static, A is v/(c²) times V. So A is a vector proportional to v, which makes sense because the magnetic field (and hence A) comes from motion. But let's think in terms of units. If V has units of volts (J/C), then A has units of T·m (since B is Tesla and A is the vector potential). Let me check the units.

Wait, the SI units might help. V is in volts (kg·m²/(s³·A·m)). A is in ampere-seconds per meter (H/m, which is (s²·kg/(A²·m³)) ). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

Option C: V has a denominator of (d c - d · v). Wait, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), right? So the denominator is (d c - (d · v)). So the term (d c - d · v) would be c times the distance minus the projection of velocity along d. That makes sense because it's the denominator in the Liénard expression for the scalar potential, maybe?

Similarly, for the vector potential in option C, it has μ₀ q c v over 4 pi times (d c - d·v). The numerator is μ₀ q c v, and the denominator is (d c - d·v). So that could fit with A being proportional to v and the denominator being similar to the denominator in V.

Option D: the denominator is (d c + d · v). Hmm, that seems different. The sign might matter depending on the direction of the terms. Wait, the denominator for the scalar potential in Maxwell's equations when considering retarded time usually has a term like c t - r · v, but I'm not sure how that translates here.

Wait, another approach: The general expression for the scalar potential V due to a moving charge includes a term that accounts for the charge's velocity. The formula is approximately V(r, t) = [q/(4πε₀)] * [1/(r - (v tr)/c²)] where tr is the retarded time. But perhaps in terms of the vector d, which is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr). But how does that tie into the denominator?

Wait, the denominator in the Liénard potentials is d c - (d · v). Because d = r - s(tr), and s(tr) is the position at time tr. So the denominator would be d c minus (d · v). So I think option C's V is similar to that, except in option C, it's multiplied by c in the numerator. Wait, let me see: option C says V is (q c) / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v)]. Hmm, but in the standard V expression, it's just q/(4πε₀ ...) without the c. So that's confusing.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. The standard expression for the scalar potential when considering the retarded time is:

V(r, t) = ( q / (4πε₀) ) * ( 1 / ( |d| - (d · v)/(c²) ) )

Wait, no, maybe more accurately, the denominator is (r - (v t_r)) where t_r is the retarded time. But perhaps in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), and s(tr) is the position of the charge at tr, which is s(tr) ≈ s(0) + v tr, assuming v is constant? Or not, because the trajectory might be more complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the general form. The scalar potential V is given by the expression involving the charge and the reciprocal of the distance, adjusted for the motion. The vector potential A is proportional to the velocity of the charge. So looking at the options, option C's A has μ₀ q c v in the numerator, and the denominator matches that of V (d c - d·v). Similarly, option D's denominator is (d c + d·v), which might have a different sign.

Wait, let's think about the direction. The denominator in the scalar potential is (d c - d · v). So if the charge is moving towards the observer, d · v would be positive, making the denominator smaller, so the potential larger, which makes sense because the moving charge would affect the field.

In the vector potential A, it's also using the same denominator, so options C and D are the only ones that have the same denominator in both V and A.

Wait, but the options for V and A in the choices: let's see.

Option C:
V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v))
A = (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - d·v))

Option D:
V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + d·v))
A = (μ₀ q v) / (4π (d c + d·v)) [Wait, no, checking the option again: D's A is (mu_o q c v) over (d c + d·v), same denominator as V.]

Wait, I think the standard form for the potentials is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(r - (v t_r) ) ]

But in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), and s(tr) is the position at time tr. If we assume that tr is the time when the field was generated, then s(tr) is the position at that time, and the velocity v is the velocity at time tr.

Wait, perhaps in the denominator, we have (d c - d · v), which comes from considering the motion of the charge. So the expressions for V and A would have this term in the denominator.

Now, looking at the vector potential A, it's typically given by (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × r̂) / r, but I'm not sure about the exact form when considering the motion and retarded time.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's velocity. The vector potential A is generally proportional to the velocity of the charge. So in the options, which ones have A proportional to v?

Options B and C (and D): option B has A proportional to v, option C has A proportional to v, and D as well.

So, if the vector potential is proportional to v, then the correct option must have A proportional to v.

But let's look at the expressions. Option C's A is (mu_o q c v) / (4 pi (d c - d·v)), while option D's A is (mu_o q c v) / (4 pi (d c + d·v)).

So the denominator is either (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). Which one is correct?

Wait, the denominator comes from the expression for the scalar potential. If the scalar potential is V = q c/(4 pi eps0 (d c - d·v)), then that's the denominator. So the denominator in A would be the same as in V.

Wait, but why is there a c in the numerator of V? Because in the standard scalar potential, V is q/(4 pi eps0 r), so if V has a c in the numerator, perhaps it's scaled by c.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the units.

The scalar potential V's unit is volts (V). The denominator in option C's V is [d c - d·v]. Since d is a distance (unit m), c is m/s, so d c has units m²/s. Similarly, d·v is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So the denominator has units m²/s, which would make the entire denominator in V have units m²/s. So the numerator is q c (C·m/s) divided by (m²/s), so (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m).

But the standard V has units (C/(4 pi eps0)) * (1/r), which is (C/(m)) as 1/r is 1/m. So option C's V's numerator has q c, so the units would be (C * m/s ) / ( m²/s ) = C/(m). Which matches the units of V. So that seems correct.

Similarly, the vector potential A has units T·m (tesla·meter). Let's compute the units for option C's A: (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - d·v)). The denominator in A is same as V, units m²/s.

Numerator: mu0 [H/m] * q [C] * c [m/s] * v [m/s] = (H * C * m²/s²). H is H = V·s/A = (kg·m²/(A² s³)) ) * s / A = kg·m²/(A² s²) ). So H·C = kg·m²/(A s²) ). Then multiply by m²/s²: kg·m^4/(A s^4 ).

Denominator: m²/s.

So overall, (kg·m^4/(A s^4 )) ) / (m²/s) ) = kg·m²/(A s^3 )

But Tesla is kg/(s² A), so T·m = (kg/(s² A)) * m = kg·m/(s² A). Comparing with the computed units: kg·m²/(A s^3 ) is not matching Tesla·meter. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in unit calculation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: What's the unit of A? It's in Weber per square meter (Wb/m²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since A is the vector potential, its units should be such that when you take the curl, you get B (tesla), which has units kg/(s² A).

Wait, the unit of A is Tesla·meter (T·m). So, let's see: mu0 is H/m, which is H/m = (V·s/A)/m = (kg·m²/(A² s³)) * s / (A m) ) = kg·m/(A² s²).

So mu0 has units kg·m/(A² s²).

In option C's A: numerator is mu0 * q * c * v.

mu0: kg·m/(A² s²)
q: C = A·s
c: m/s
v: m/s

So mu0 * q * c * v = (kg·m/(A² s²)) ) * (A s) * (m/s) * (m/s) =
= (kg·m) * (A s) * m²/s² ) / (A² s²) )

Wait, let me compute the dimensions step by step:

mu0: kg·m/(A² s²)
q: A·s
c: m/s
v: m/s

Multiply together: (kg·m/(A² s²)) ) * (A s) ) = kg·m * (A s) / (A² s²) * m/(s) * m/s.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated, but perhaps it's better to think that option C's A is correctly scaled because in the standard expression, A is proportional to v, and the denominator matches that of V.

So looking back, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials when the charge is moving would involve terms that account for the motion, which appears in the denominator as (d c - d·v), as in option C.

But let me double-check. The scalar potential V is given by (q c)/(4 pi eps0 (dc - d·v)), and A is (mu0 q c v)/(4 pi (dc - d·v)). Does that make sense?

Wait, another thought: the potentials should depend on the speed of light, c, because electromagnetic effects propagate at c. So the denominator being (d c - d·v) accounts for the relative motion, which is part of the retardation effect. This makes sense because d is the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to the observation point. So if the charge is moving, the term d·v would adjust the effective distance the field has to travel.

So V and A in option C have the same denominator, which is correct. That leaves options C and D as possibilities, but D has a plus in the denominator, which may not account for the correct direction.

Wait, let's think about the direction. If the charge is moving towards the observer (so d is pointing towards the charge, and v is in the same direction as d), then d·v is positive. So the denominator becomes d c - (d·v). If d·v is large, the denominator is smaller, making V larger, which is consistent with the charge moving towards you, increasing the electric field and thus the potential.

So option C's denominator (d c - d·v) seems correct.

So the scalar potential in option C is V = (q c)/(4 pi eps0 (d c - d·v)), and A is (mu0 q c v)/(4 pi (d c - d·v)). That looks correct.

Wait a moment, but the standard scalar potential for a moving charge is (q/(4 pi eps0)) * [1/(r - (v t_r)))] where t_r is the retarded time. But in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), perhaps s(tr) is approximately the position of the charge at tr, so r = s(tr) + d. So t_r is the time it takes for the effect to reach the observer, which would be t_r = (|d|)/c. But if the charge is moving, this gets more complicated.

Alternatively, the expression for V would be (q c)/(4 pi eps0 (d c - d·v)), as in option C.

So putting it all together, I think option C is the correct one.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) due to a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the options provided. The scalar potential \( V \) is related to the electric field, while the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is related to the magnetic field. For a moving charge, the potentials are influenced by the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and the geometry of the problem.

### Key Observations:
1. **Option A**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given as the static case \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is correct for a stationary charge. However, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2/c^2 \), which is inconsistent with the standard form of \( \vec{A} \), as it should involve \( \vec{v} \) linearly. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: The scalar potential \( V \) is again the static case \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \). The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which aligns with the expected dependence on \( \vec{v} \). However, this option does not account for the motion of the charge in the denominator of the potentials, making it incomplete and inconsistent with the retarded time effects.

3. **Option C**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given as \( V = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). Here, the denominator \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) correctly accounts for the motion of the charge and the geometry of the problem. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) share the same denominator, which is consistent with the retarded time effects. This option is consistent with the Liénard potentials and the standard form of the electromagnetic potentials for a moving charge.

4. **Option D**: The scalar potential \( V \) is given as \( V = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), and the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). The denominator \( dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the standard form of the potentials, as it does not correctly account for the motion of the charge. This option is therefore incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the correct choice because it properly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion and the geometry of the problem in both the scalar and vector potentials. The denominator \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) aligns with the retarded time effects, and the expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) are consistent with the Liénard potentials.
