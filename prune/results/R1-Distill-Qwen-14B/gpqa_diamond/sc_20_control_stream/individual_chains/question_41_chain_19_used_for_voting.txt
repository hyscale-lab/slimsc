Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving, right? That must complicate things because the medium itself is not stationary relative to the observer.

Let me think. The speed of light in a stationary medium is c divided by n, where n is the refractive index. So normally, v_light = c/n. But since the glass is moving towards the observer, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, speed addition in relativity... Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at speed c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion, right?

Wait, no. Or is the light's speed in the glass u = c/n, and the glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light? So the observer in the lab frame would see the light's speed as u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, then the beam is moving in that direction too. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a scenario where Galilean relativity applies, not special relativity. Because the speed of light in the medium is much less than c, but wait, in reality, in any frame, the speed of light should be c. Wait, but no, because the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but from the lab frame's perspective, maybe it's different.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem says "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory." So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to find the speed of light in the lab, we need to perform a velocity transformation.

But wait, according to special relativity, the speed of light remains c in all frames. So if the glass is moving, but the light is within it, does that affect the observed speed? Or is it that the light's speed in the lab is still c because of the principles of relativity?

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's in the medium's rest frame. But from the lab frame, where the medium is moving, does that change the observed speed?

I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about it. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the +x direction (towards the observer). So according to the lab frame, the speed of the light is v_light' = (v_light + v) / (1 + (v_light * v)/c²).

Wait, but wait. Let me plug in v_light = c/n. So substituting:

v_light' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So numerator is (c + v n)/n, denominator is (1 + v/(n c)).

Wait, but if c is much larger than other terms, perhaps we can approximate, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the same as the speed of the glass plus the speed of the light in the glass's frame, but corrected by the relativistic addition formula.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. If the glass is moving towards the observer, how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Wait, but I remember that according to relativity, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. Oh wait, but that's in a vacuum. When it's in a medium, the speed is c/n, but is that the speed measured in the lab?

Wait, no. Because the medium itself is moving. So suppose in the medium's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But in the lab frame, where the medium is moving at v, the light's speed would be different.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the index of refraction itself would change in the lab frame? Or is that not the case? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using Galilean addition, not relativistic. Because the options don't look relativistic. Let me check the options. Option B is 1, which is c. So that would suggest that the speed is c, but that's only if in vacuum. Wait, but the light is in glass, so it's not in vacuum.

Wait, but if the glass is moving, perhaps the speed of light in the lab is still c/n, but that doesn't make sense because in the lab frame, the glass is moving. Or maybe in the lab frame, the light is moving at c/n relative to the glass, so the lab frame would see it as (c/n + v). But that's Galilean addition, which is only valid at low speeds.

But looking at the options, option B is 1, which is c. That would make sense if the speed is still c, but that's only in vacuum. Wait, but the light is in a medium with refractive index n. Hmm.

Wait, no, in any frame, the speed of light in a medium is c/n. Because the refractive index is a property of the medium, not the frame. So even if the medium is moving, the light's speed in that medium is still c/n, relative to the medium.

So in the lab frame, the medium is moving at v, so the speed of light in the lab would be (c/n + v). But that's only correct if the speeds are small compared to c, and using Galilean addition.

Wait, but in reality, relativistic effects prevent that. Because according to relativity, the speed can't exceed c. But when the medium is moving, the light speed in the lab frame can't be more than c.

But wait, the question states that c=1, so perhaps we're to neglect relativistic effects and use Galilean addition. So in that case, the speed would be (c/n + v), but in terms of the given options, that's (1 + v n)/(n), because c=1, so 1/n + v = (1 + v n)/n.

But looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is different. Hmm. So that suggests that perhaps it's not a simple addition.

Wait, maybe I should approach it using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)].

In this case, u is the speed of light in the medium's frame, which is u = c/n = 1/n.

v is the speed of the medium in the lab frame, say v (but the direction matters). Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the beam. Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the glass is moving in the direction of the beam, which is towards the observer. So the beam's speed in the medium is 1/n, and the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction.

So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) ).

Wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula applies when the two velocities are along the same direction. So if the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light in the medium, then in the lab frame, the light's velocity is u' as above.

So substituting u = 1/n and v (medium's velocity) into the formula:

u' = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) ]

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

= [1 + n v ] / [n + v ]

Because denominator becomes n * [1 + (v/(n)) ] = n + v.

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which matches.

Hmm, so that would be the correct answer. But wait, what if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light? Let me confirm: the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so in the lab frame, their velocities add up, but with the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well. So both are moving in the same direction, so the formula applies as above.

So the correct answer would be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam has a speed of \( u = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \) in the glass's rest frame, where \( n \) is the refractive index. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify further:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**.

The formula is u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)].

= [1 + n v ] / [n + v ]
