Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state or has some uncertainty.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think each of these terms is a projector onto the basis states. So, let me write that out more explicitly. 

|0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], right? Because when you multiply |0⟩ (a column vector [1;0]) by its bra ⟨0| (row vector [1,0]), you get a diagonal matrix with 1 at the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]].

So when you add these two matrices together, you get [[1+0, 0+0], [0+0, 0+1]] which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then, you multiply by 1/2, so the density matrix becomes ρ = (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]].

Wait, so ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. So it's like a completely mixed state, right? Because in a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |0⟩⟨0|, which has one diagonal element as 1 and the other as 0. But here, both are 1/2, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space. The pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So, the general form for a single-qubit density matrix is [[ (1+ a_x)/2 , (a_y - i a_z)/2 ], [ (a_y + i a_z)/2 , (1 - a_x)/2 ]], where a_x, a_y, a_z are the components of the Bloch vector r = (a_x, a_y, a_z).

Let me compute this for the given ρ. Our ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ]

So, let's compare this with the general form.

The (1,1) element is (1 + a_x)/2. In our case, (1 + a_x)/2 = 1/2. Multiply both sides by 2: 1 + a_x = 1 → a_x = 0.

The (2,2) element is (1 - a_x)/2. Again, (1 - a_x)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - a_x =1 → a_x=0. So a_x is 0.

Now, the off-diagonal elements are (a_y - i a_z)/2. In our matrix, the off-diagonal elements are 0. So (a_y - i a_z)/2 = 0. That would mean a_y =0 and a_z =0. 

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). Wait, but wait. The Bloch vector for a maximally mixed state is indeed at the origin because it's completely unpolarized.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = (⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, ⟨Z⟩), where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

So, for ρ, the expectation values are ⟨X⟩ = Tr(ρ X), same for Y and Z.

Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Compute Tr(ρ X) = (1/2)(1)(0) + (1/2)(1)(0) + cross terms? Wait, no. Tr(ρ X) is the sum of the products of the diagonal elements. Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, ρ is diagonal, so when we multiply ρ and X, the product will be:

ρ X = (1/2) * [ |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ] * X.

But X swaps |0⟩ and |1⟩, so |0⟩⟨0| * X = |0⟩⟨0| * X → which is |0⟩⟨0| (X matrix) → X has elements (0 1; 1 0), so |0⟩⟨0| * X is |0⟩⟨0| X → which is |0⟩⟨0| multiplied by X. Wait, maybe it's easier to do matrix multiplication.

ρ X = (1/2) [ [1,0], [0,1] ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = (1/2) [[(1*0 + 0*1), (1*1 + 0*0)], [ (0*0 + 1*1), (0*1 +1*0) ] ]

Wait, actually, that would be (1/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So taking the trace: Tr(ρ X) is (0 + 0)/2 = 0.

Similarly, Tr(ρ Y) would be zero, and Tr(ρ Z) would also be zero.

Because for Tr(ρ Z) = (1/2)(1)(1) + (1/2)(1)(-1) = 1/2 -1/2 = 0.

So all components of r are zero. So the point is at (0,0,0), which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten explicitly as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a maximally mixed state, as it represents equal probability for the qubit to be in either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state. In the Bloch sphere representation, the geometrical position of a quantum state is determined by the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (a_x, a_y, a_z) \), which is related to the density matrix through the expectation values of the Pauli matrices:

\[
a_x = \text{Tr}(\rho X), \quad a_y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y), \quad a_z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z),
\]

where \(X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), \(Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\).

1. **Calculating \(a_x\):**

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho X) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} (0 + 0) = 0.
\]

2. **Calculating \(a_y\):**

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho Y) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} (0 + 0) = 0.
\]

3. **Calculating \(a_z\):**

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho Z) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} (1 - 1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A (\(r = (1,1,0)\)):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **Option B (\(r = (0,0,1)\)):** Incorrect, as \(a_z = 0\), not 1.
- **Option C (\(r = (0,0,0)\)):** Correct, as shown by the calculations.
- **Option D (\(r = (1,1,1)\)):** Incorrect, as this does not match the Bloch vector for the given density matrix.
