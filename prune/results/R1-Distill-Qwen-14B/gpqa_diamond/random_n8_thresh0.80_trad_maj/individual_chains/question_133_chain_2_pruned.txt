Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. But let's take it step by step. I remember that when dealing with buffers, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is super useful. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right?

First, I need to figure out the concentrations of each of these salts in the solution. The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. Both the KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are present in 1.00 grams each.

Let me calculate the moles for each. For KH2PO4, the molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1 divided by approximately 136.09 is about 0.00735 moles. Wait, more accurately, 136.09 is approximately 136.1, so 1/136.1 ≈ 0.007336 moles. So about 0.007336 mol.

Next, Na2HPO4·2H2O. Its molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol. Let me check: 178 divided by 1 is 0.00561, so yeah, about 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. So the concentration of HPO4^2- comes from this salt. So for KH2PO4, what does it dissociate into? KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes me think of a buffer solution, which consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base. In this case, the weak acid is H2PO4^- (which can donate another proton to become HPO4^2-), and the conjugate base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. I think I need to get their concentrations right. So for each of these salts:

- 1 mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-.
- 1 mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So the moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- is 0.00561 mol.

Now, the volume is 0.2 L, so the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] =
