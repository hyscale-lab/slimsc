Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts: delta_0 is 90 degrees, delta_1 is 67, delta_2 is 55, delta_3 is 30, and delta_4 is 13 degrees. I'm told to ignore the rest, so I guess higher l values beyond 4 don't contribute. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if the energy directly affects this part of the calculation.

Wait, the scattering amplitude. Right, in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude in the case of partial waves is given by a sum over the different angular momentum states. The general formula I remember is something like f(theta) = sum (something involving the phase shifts and spherical harmonics). But wait, I'm trying to find the imaginary part along the incident direction, which probably means at theta=0 degrees.

Oh right, when you're looking along the incident beam, that's theta=0. The scattering amplitude at theta=0 can be simplified. I think the formula is related to the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

Wait, let me recall. The scattering amplitude f(theta) is given by:

f(theta) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^L [ (2l + 1) * (sin(delta_l) ) / (1 + i e^{i delta_l} ) ) * P_l(cos(theta)) ]

But when theta is 0, cos(theta) is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because P_l(1) is the value of the Legendre polynomial at 1, which is 1 for all l. So that simplifies the sum.

Wait, but I also remember that the imaginary part of the amplitude at theta=0 is given by a specific expression. Let me think. The amplitude can be written as f = f_real + i f_imag. And at theta=0, the imaginary part is given by:

Im f(0) = (1/(k)) * sum_{l=0}^L [ (2l + 1) * sin(delta_l) * (something) ]

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta) = (1
