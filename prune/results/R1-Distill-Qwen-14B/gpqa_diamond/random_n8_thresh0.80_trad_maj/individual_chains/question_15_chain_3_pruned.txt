Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the main thing here is the transit probability.

I think the transit probability (P) depends on the size of the star and the planet. Oh right, the formula I remember is P = R_p^2 / (R_s^2 * a^2), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. I think the actual formula is P = (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a * sin i)), but wait, no, that might be the duration or something else. Alternatively, another approach: the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance? No, maybe not. Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (e))), but since both orbits are circular, e is 1. Hmm, no, maybe that's not right either.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The probability of a transit is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit projected onto the plane of the sky. Oh wait, no, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. So the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (some function of the orbital distance and star's radius, but I'm not recalling correctly.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p) / a ), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, but that's when the planet is at a distance a, so the probability is roughly (R_s / a)^2. Wait, no, that can't be right because if a
