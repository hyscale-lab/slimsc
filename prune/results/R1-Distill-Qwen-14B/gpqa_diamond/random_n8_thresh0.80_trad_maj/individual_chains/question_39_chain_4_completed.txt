Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says we have a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Since "i" is the square root of -1, this means the wave function has both real and imaginary parts.

When measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the numerical value of "a".

The options given are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability density of finding a particle at a certain position is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². The integral of this probability density over all space should equal 1 because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex function. Let me write that down:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i.

To find the probability density, I need to compute the absolute square of ψ(x). The absolute value squared of a complex number is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So the real part is (a / sqrt(1 + x)), and the imaginary part is (-0.5), since i is the imaginary unit.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x)))]^2 + (-0.5)^2.

Which simplifies to (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait a minute, that seems a bit odd. Because usually, the wave function should have its probability density integrate to 1 over the region where the particle exists. But in this case, the function is given as a sum of a real and imaginary term. Is that the correct approach?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the wave function is normalizable. But the question says that when measuring, particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So the probability density must be zero outside this region. Hmm, but the wave function as given isn't zero outside; it's just that particles aren't found there. Maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, but the form given is for that region.

Wait, no—the problem states that when they measured, none were found outside. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. But the given ψ(x) is for the region where it can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So in that interval, the wave function is as given.

But to find "a", we need to ensure that the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 equals 1. That's the normalization condition.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Substituting |ψ(x)|² as (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that would mean integrating (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me write that as:

Integral (1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this into two integrals:

a² * Integral (1 to 3) [1/(1+x)] dx + Integral (1 to 3) 0.25 dx = 1.

Calculating each part separately.

First integral: ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Second integral: 0.25 * ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Therefore, a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ(x)|², it's (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because the imaginary part is -0.5i, so the square of its magnitude is (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

So the expression is correct.

The integral is then ∫ (a^2/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Which gives a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Thus, a^2 = (0.5) / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is around 0.85, so option B.

But wait, the given wave function includes a term that's not purely real. Normally, wave functions can be complex, but in this context, the presence of a non-zero imaginary part might affect the normalization. Let me think.

Wait, no, the normalization integral is correct because I accounted for both real and imaginary parts. So the calculation should be fine.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about whether the wave function is correctly given. Because sometimes, the wave function could be written in a form that's purely real or purely imaginary, but in this case, it's a combination.

But the calculation I did should still hold because the probability density is the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So the answer should be option B, 0.85.


To determine the value of "a", we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \approx 0.6931
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of "a" is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
