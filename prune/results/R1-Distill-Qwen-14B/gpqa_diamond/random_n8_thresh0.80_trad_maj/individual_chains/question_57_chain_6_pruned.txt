Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The given data are some phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67 degrees, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. The rest of the phase shifts are to be ignored. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, and the answer is one of those.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) has real and imaginary parts. For elastic scattering, the imaginary part is related to the phase shifts. The formula, as I recall, is something like the imaginary part of f(θ) equals (k/(2π)) multiplied by the sum of the phase shifts times the Legendre polynomials or something like that. Wait, actually, the general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (a_l e^{iδ_l} (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) Pl(cosθ)), or maybe it's the sum of a_l (e^{iδ_l} -1) Pl(cosθ). Either way, the imaginary part would come from the imaginary components of this sum.

Wait, I think the imaginary part of f(θ) along the incident direction would be when θ is 0 degrees, right? Because along the incident beam direction, the scattering angle is zero. So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

The formula I think is Im[f(θ)] = (k/(2π)) * Σ [δ_l * Pl(cosθ)], but wait, maybe that's for the differential cross-section. Let me think again. Oh right, the differential cross-section is |f(θ)|², which is (1/(k²)) [ (Σ a_l (e^{iδ_l} -1) Pl(θ) )² + (Σ a_l (e^{iδ_l} -1) Pl(θ) )² ]? No, that's not right. Wait, the differential cross-section is given by (1/k²) [Σ a_l (e^{iδ_l} -1) Pl(θ)]², but that's the modulus squared.

But I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f(θ). So, f(θ) is a complex quantity, and since the scattering is elastic, probably the imaginary part is related to the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by certain factors.

Wait, let me recall the optical theorem. The optical theorem connects the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The imaginary part of f(0) is (k/(4π)) times the total cross-section, σ_total. But wait, I'm not given the total cross-section here. Hmm, but maybe that's a different approach.

Alternatively, the general expression for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (k/(2π)) times the sum over l of δ_l * P_l(1) because cos(0) is 1. Because the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are known to be 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l, since all the terms in the polynomial become 1 when x is 1.

Wait, yes, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for any l. So, putting it all together, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is Im[f(0)] = (k/(2π)) * Σ δ_l * 1, where the sum is over all the non-zero phase shifts given.

Wait, but I need to check the formula correctly. I think the correct formula for Im f(θ) is (k/(2π)) * Σ [ (sin δ_l) * (d_l) * P_l(cosθ) }, where d_l is maybe the product of some factors. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is (k/(2π)) times the sum over all l of (sin δ_l) times (something). But wait, let's think about the general form of the scattering amplitude. The expression is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) a_l P_l(cosθ) ), where a_l = (e^{iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) * (something else?), perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the standard expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ). So then, f(θ) is a sum over terms involving (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ), multiplied by (1/(2ik)).
