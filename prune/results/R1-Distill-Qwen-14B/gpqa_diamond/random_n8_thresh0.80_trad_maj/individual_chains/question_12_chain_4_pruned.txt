Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. And the Pi(+) is at rest. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are four possibilities for the kinetic energies of the products. I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the Pi is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in this problem, the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's, so maybe we can treat it as massless. That might simplify things.

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi(+) because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy of the muon and the neutrino must add up to the same 139.6 MeV. 

But wait, the muon has its rest mass, so its total energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino, since it's massless, its energy is just its kinetic energy (since E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2, and m is zero). 

So, let me write down the energy conservation equation:

Energy before = Energy after
m_π c² = (m_μ c² + K_μ) + E_ν

Similarly, for momentum conservation: the total momentum is zero. So, the muon's momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's. So, |p_μ| = |p_ν|.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then, the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction. 

So, momentum conservation is satisfied. Now, let's write the energy expressions in terms of p.

For the muon, its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) /c²? Wait, I might be mixing units. Let me
