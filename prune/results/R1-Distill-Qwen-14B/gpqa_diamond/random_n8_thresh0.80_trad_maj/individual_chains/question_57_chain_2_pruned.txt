Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, I think. The phase shifts are given as δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄, with the others being ignored. So, the values are 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. Oh wait, the units are degrees, right?

The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momenta l, each term involving spherical Bessel functions and the phase shifts.

But wait, when we're looking along the incident beam direction, that's θ=0 degrees. Oh, and for θ=0, the scattering amplitude formula simplifies. I think the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) involves a specific sum over the phase shifts.

Let me think. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (the direction of the incident beam) is given by something like (1/(2π)) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l + 1) times sin(δ_l), where δ_l are the phase shifts for each l.

Wait, yes. I recall the formula: Im f(0) = (1/(2π)) * Σ (2l + 1) sin δ_l. So each term in the sum is (2l+1) multiplied by the sine of the phase shift δ_l, and then all these are added together and multiplied by 1/(2π).

So let's plug in the given phase shifts. The phase shifts given are for l=0,1,2,3,4. Let me check the values:

δ₀ = 90 degrees,

δ₁ = 67 degrees,

δ₂ = 55 degrees,

δ₃ = 30 degrees,

δ₄ = 13 degrees.

So each l from 0 to 4 contributes a term. Let's compute each term.

For l=0: (2*0 +1) =1. sin(90) is 1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: 2*1+1=3. sin(67) ≈ let me calculate this. Sin(60) is about 0.866, sin(67) is a bit more. Let me think, 67 degrees is approximately 0.9205. So 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. sin(55) is approx 0.8192. So 5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3: 2*3+1=7. sin(30)=0.5. So 7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4: 2*4+1=9. sin(13) is about 0.22495. So 9 * 0.22495 ≈2.02455.

Now, sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615,

3.7615 +4.096 =7.8575,

7.8575 +3.5 =11.3575,

11.3575 + 2.02455 ≈13.382.

So the sum is approximately 13.382.

Then, Im f(0)= (1/(2π)) * 13.382.

Let me compute 13.382 divided by (2π). 2π is about 6.28319. So 13.382 /6.28319 ≈2.13.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answers are in the hundreds or thousands. Hmm, that's a problem. I must have missed something here. Oh wait, wait a second—what are the units here?

Wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees, but in the formula, do we use radians or degrees? Oh, right! The sine function in the formula uses the phase shift in radians. Oh, that's a crucial point. So I think I made a mistake here. Because when I calculated sin(67), I assumed it's in degrees, but if the phase shifts are in degrees, then I need to convert them to radians before taking the sine.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the phase shifts δ_l are given in degrees, so when computing sin(δ_l), I should convert each δ_l from degrees to radians. So that changes things.

So, let's recalculate each term correctly, using radians.

Convert each δ_l to radians:

δ₀ = 90 degrees = π/2 radians ≈1.5708 radians.

δ₁ =67 degrees. Multiply by π/180: 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians.

δ₂=55 degrees: 55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 radians.

δ₃=30 degrees: 30 * π/180 = π/6 ≈0.523599 radians.

δ₄=13 degrees: 13 * π/180 ≈0.226893 radians.

Now compute sin(δ_l) for each:

sin(δ₀) = sin(π/2)=1.

sin(δ₁)= sin(1.16937) ≈ approx 0.916515.

sin(δ₂)= sin(0.95993) ≈ approx 0.81615.

sin(δ₃)= sin(0.523599)=0.5.

sin(δ₄)= sin(0.226893) ≈ approx 0.22556.

Now, compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)* sin(δ₀) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * 0.916515≈2.74955.

l=2:5 *0.81615≈4.08075.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22556≈2.03004.

Adding them up:

1 +2.74955=3.74955,

3.74955 +4.08075=7.8303,

7.8303 +3.5=11.3303,

11.3303 +2.03004≈13.3603.

So the sum is approximately 13.3603.

Now, multiply by (1/(2π)).

13.3603 / (2π) ≈13.3603 /6.28319 ≈2.126.

Wait, but the options are all in the hundreds or
