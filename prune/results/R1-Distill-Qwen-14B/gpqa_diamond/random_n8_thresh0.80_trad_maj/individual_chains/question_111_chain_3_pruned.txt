Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and tackle each part one by one.

The question has two reactions to analyze, and then I need to pick the major products from the given options. The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. Hmm.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. So, cyclohexanone with substituents: an ethyl group at C2 and methyl groups at C2 and C6. Wait, no, wait. The numbering is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. And at position 6, another methyl. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1 (since it's cyclohexan-1-one). The substituents are: C2 has an ethyl and methyl, and C6 has a methyl. So the ring is substituted at positions 2 and 6.

The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. T-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which suggests an elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. But wait, the starting material is a ketone. Oh, right! This might be a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but wait, no, Claisen typically involves aldehydes and ketones with esters under basic conditions. Alternatively, if it's an aldol condensation. But wait, when a carbonyl reacts with an enolate and an ester, perhaps it's an example of a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. The cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which can act as an electrophilic site. The enolate of the ketone could form, but wait, the base is t-BuOK, which is more likely to deprotonate where? Let me think about where the alpha protons are. The cyclohexanone has carbonyl at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2. So at C2, there are protons. But in the structure, C2 has ethyl and methyl groups. So the substituents are bulky. That might influence where the deprotonation occurs.

But wait, under basic conditions, especially with a strong base like t-BuOK, the cyclohexanone would form an enolate. The enolate could then attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl acrylate is the nucleophile, but more likely the enolate would attack.

Wait, no, in Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (the electrophile
