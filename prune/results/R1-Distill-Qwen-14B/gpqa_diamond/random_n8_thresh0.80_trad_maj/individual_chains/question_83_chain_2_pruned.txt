Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate both values and match them.

First, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases. Let me calculate the new concentration after mixing.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid remain the same because we're only adding water, which doesn't react. So, moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Let's compute that.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles/volume (in liters). So, 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

I need to find two things: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

Let's start with the equivalence point because that's often easier. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions (CH3COO
