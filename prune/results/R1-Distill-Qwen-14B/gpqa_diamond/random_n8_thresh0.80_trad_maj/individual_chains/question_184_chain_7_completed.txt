Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, I need to figure out the target molecule's structure. The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. On the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, wait—actually, benzene rings are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait—maybe I should draw this out. Let's imagine the benzene ring. If the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, but in a meta arrangement, but that's not possible. Oh wait, wait. No, 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent positions. So it's a tri-substituted benzene with ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is different. Let me think: the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions on the benzene ring. So that's three substituents in a row, each adjacent to the next.

Wait, but how can that happen? Wait, substituents on benzene can be ortho, meta, or para to each other. If the molecule is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro, that would mean the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So, ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3, which would be meta to each other (since positions 1 and 3 are two apart), but then the tert-butyl is at 2, adjacent to ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure. Let's see:

Positions 1: ethoxy
Position 2: tert-butyl
Position 3: nitro

So, the ring has ethoxy at position 1, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl), which is adjacent to position 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are all in adjacent positions. That's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, the question is about the reaction sequence needed to get there from benzene. Benzene is a starting material, so I need to introduce three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

But wait, the order of substitution matters because each substituent can direct the next substitution. Benzene is initially unreactive, but each substituent will activate or deactivate the ring and direct incoming groups to certain positions.

Let me recall:

- Nitro groups are meta directors because they are strong deactivating (due to being electron-withdrawing groups).
- Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an ether, O- is electron-donating via resonance) and is an ortho/para director.
- Tert-butyl is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons via induction) and is an ortho/para director.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last? Or maybe first.

Wait, no. Let's think about the steps.

Benzene is first. Then, the first reaction will introduce one substituent. Let's say the first substituent is ethoxy. So, the first step would be a nitration, ethoxylation, or alkylation.

Wait, but ethoxy is an ether. To attach an ethoxy group to benzene, you can perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, ethoxy is an O-containing group. Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation (like t-butyl chloride) or acylation. Wait, but ethoxy is an ether; perhaps you can use a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Williamson synthesis, but that's for ethers, but that requires a good leaving group, like a tosylate.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of introducing substituents based on their directing effects.

If I first introduce the strongest director, which might influence the others.

Wait, the nitro group is a meta director. So, introducing it first will direct the next substituents to meta positions.

But in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3. Hmm, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups. Because if nitro is introduced first, then the next substituents would be in the meta positions relative to nitro, which could complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is introduced second. Let's think through possible sequences.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's figure out the order they're introduced.

Option 1: Introduce nitro first. But nitro is meta-directing. Then, the next substituent would be in meta position relative to nitro. Then the third substituent would be directed based on the second substituent.

But in the target, ethoxy and tert-butyl are adjacent. Hmm, but if the first substituent is nitro, the second could be ethoxy, which is activating (ortho/para to nitro). Wait, but if nitro is at position 1, then the ethoxy could be at position 3 (meta to nitro). Then the next substituent (tert-butyl) would be directed by ethoxy (ortho/para) to ethoxy. So where would that be? If ethoxy is at position 3, then tert-butyl could go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, the substituents are positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual steps.

Let me think about each substituent's introduction step.

The target has:

- Ethoxy at position 1
- tert-butyl at position 2
- nitro at position 3

So, perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy first.

2. Then introduce tert-butyl in the ortho position relative to ethoxy.

3. Then introduce nitro in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be position 3, which is adjacent to the tert-butyl.

But wait, after introducing ethoxy, the ring is activated. Then we add tert-butyl using Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is tricky because it can form carbocations, leading to rearrangements. Alternatively, perhaps we use a directing group.

Wait, but if ethoxy is already present, which is an activating, ortho/para director, then adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would place it ortho or para to ethoxy.

So, if ethoxy is at position 1, adding tert-butyl would be at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, it's at position 2, adjacent to ethoxy. So that's possible.

Then, the next substituent is nitro. Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So, the next substituent would be directed by which group?

Well, ethoxy is activating (ortho/para), and tert-butyl is activating (ortho/para). But the nitro group is a deactivating, meta director. So, which substituent would dominate the directing?

Wait, in a di-substituted benzene, the directing group depends on which substituent is more powerful. Since ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating, but ethoxy is more activating (electron-donating via resonance), perhaps the ethoxy group would direct the incoming nitro group.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group. So, the order of substitution can't be nitro last because once nitro is present, it would deactivates the ring, making further substitutions difficult.

Wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 3. Let's imagine the ring after ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2). To add nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy. Hmm.

Wait, when you have ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, the positions 3 and 6 are open. The next group (nitro) would be influenced by both substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the tert-butyl. Let me think.

If the first substituent is nitro, then the next substituent (ethoxy) would go meta to nitro, which would be position 4. Then, the third substituent (tert-butyl) would be directed by ethoxy. If ethoxy is at 4, then tert-butyl could be at 3 (ortho) or 5 (para). But in the target, the substituents are at 1,2,3. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should think about this differently. Let's consider the order in which substituents are added.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro (NO2) at position 3.

The three substituents are adjacent: positions 1,2,3.

Wait, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is a bit unusual. Let me think about how this can happen.

Perhaps the substituents are added in such a way that each new group is adjacent to the previous one.

But that requires each substitution to be in a specific position, which requires certain directing effects.

Let me think about the order of substitution.

Let's consider three steps:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group adjacent to ethoxy.

3. Add nitro group adjacent to tert-butyl, which is also adjacent to ethoxy.

But, wait, after adding ethoxy, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go ortho or para to ethoxy. If we add it ortho (position 2), then the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Now, adding nitro would be influenced by these groups. Ethoxy is activating, so nitration would be directed by it. Nitration is usually a meta director for the ring, but when there are multiple substituents, the directing is determined by the existing groups.

Wait, in a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2), which substituent is more influential in directing the next substitution?

Ethoxy is a strong activating group (ortho/para), while tert-butyl is a weak activating group (ortho/para). So, perhaps the ethoxy group would dominate. So, the next nitro group would enter at position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl and meta to the ethoxy. Alternatively, considering the positions, perhaps the nitro group would end up at position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl at 2 and next to ethoxy at 1.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group would go into the position relative to the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the tert-butyl. Let's see.

If first, add nitro group at position 1. Since nitro is meta-directing, the next substitution (ethoxy) would go at position 3 (meta to nitro). Then, the third substitution (tert-butyl) would go ortho to ethoxy (position 4). But that would give substituents at 1 (nitro), 3 (ethoxy), and 4 (tert-butyl), which doesn't match the target.

Hmm, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then nitro, then tert-butyl? No, because nitro is a deactivating group, so after nitro is introduced, further substitution might be difficult.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible steps each option presents and see which sequence leads to the correct structure.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Each option lists a series of reactions. Let's try to analyze each option's steps.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)
ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization)
v) dilute H2SO4
vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis)
vii) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy group via SN2)
viii) Fe/HCl (probably a reduction)
ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?)

Wait, perhaps this is a bit confusing. Let me think step by step.

Starting with benzene.

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So, benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration with HNO3/H2SO4. Nitration is a meta director. So, the nitro group will be added at meta to tert-butyl. So, position 3.

So now, tert-butyl at position 1, nitro at position 3.

Then, iii) sulfonation. This adds a sulfonic acid group (SO3H), which is a strong meta-directing group.

But wait, after sulfonation, the ring is very deactivated, making further substitution difficult. Not sure if this is the right approach.

Then iv) NaNO2/HCl: this is for diazotization. So, would the nitro group be converted into a diazonium salt? Or another substituent?

Wait, maybe nitration is followed by sulfonation, which adds a third substituent. But sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, making further substitution difficult.

v) Dilute H2SO4: Maybe for some reaction, like acid treatment.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Hydrolysis perhaps?

vii) NaOH/EtBr: Maybe a Williamson ether synthesis, but I'm not sure how at this point.

viii) Fe/HCl: Could be a reduction, but Fe/HCl is a reagent for catalytic hydrogenation? Or perhaps for removing nitro groups.

ix) Another nitration. So, perhaps nitro group is added again. But the target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, not sure. Option A's steps might not be leading to the desired product.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts)
ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction of nitro to amine)
iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration)
v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization)
vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis)
vii) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy substitution)
viii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
ix) dilute H2SO4 

Wait, starting with benzene.

i) Friedel-Crafts: benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: adds nitro group meta to tert-butyl.

So structure is tert-butyl at 1, nitro at 3.

iii) Fe/HCl: Perhaps this is a reduction step, converting nitro to amine. So, tert-butyl at 1, amine at 3.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration again. But where? The ring now has an amine (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The new nitro group would be directed by the amine. So, nitro would go to ortho or para to amine.

But since the ring is already substituted with tert-butyl at 1 and amine at 3, adding another nitro would be at position 5 (ortho to amine at 3) or position 6 (para). Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Then, v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization. So, the amine (at 3) becomes a diazonium chloride.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Probably hydrolysis, turning the diazonium into a hydroxyl group. So now, substituents are tert-butyl at 1, hydroxyl at 3.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: This is a nucleophilic substitution—perhaps introducing an ethoxy group. Wait, how? NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr) is a Finkelstein reaction, but in such conditions, maybe an SN2 substitution. But in this case, the ring has a hydroxyl group at 3, which can be converted to a good leaving group (like tosylate) before substitution. But perhaps in the presence of NaOH and EtBr, the hydroxyl group is replaced by ethoxy.

So, after vii, substituents are tert-butyl at 1, ethoxy at 3.

viii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation—adds a sulfonic acid group. So now, substituents are tert-butyl at 1, ethoxy at 3, and sulfonic acid somewhere. But our target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group.

ix) dilute H2SO4: Acid workup perhaps.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to lead to the target.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts)
ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iv) Fe/HCl (reduction)
v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization)
vi) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration)
vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis)
viii) dilute H2SO4 
ix) NaOH/EtBr (introduce ethoxy)

Starting with benzene.

i) Friedel-Crafts: becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Sulfonation: adds a sulfonic acid group. Now, the ring has two substituents: tert-butyl and sulfonic acid. Sulfonic acid is strong meta-directing and deactivating.

iii) Nitration: HNO3/H2SO4. The nitro group would be directed by the sulfonic acid, which is meta. So, nitro goes meta to sulfonic acid. The ring now has tert-butyl, sulfonic acid, and nitro groups.

iv) Fe/HCl: Reduction of nitro group to amine. So, nitro at position x becomes amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amine group.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: Another nitration. Not sure where it would go.

vii) Hydrolysis: Maybe of a diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.

viii) Dilute H2SO4: Acid treatment.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: Introduce ethoxy via substitution.

This sequence seems complicated and perhaps leads to more substituents than needed. Also, the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this option might not be correct.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
ii) Fe/HCl (reduction)
iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts)
iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
v) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization)
vi) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
vii) dilute H2SO4 
viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis)
ix) NaOH/EtBr (introduce ethoxy)

Starting with benzene.

i) Nitration: adds nitro group. Now, nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: Reduction of nitro to amine. So, amine at position 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride: The ring has an amine group (activating, ortho/para). So, tert-butyl would be added ortho or para to amine. Let's say position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assuming it goes to position 2.

So now, substituents are amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

iv) Nitration: Now, with amine (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para), the nitro group would be directed by the amine (since it's more activating). So, nitro could go to position 3 (ortho to amine) or position 5 (para to amine).

If it goes to position 3, then the substituents are amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of amine at 1. Forms a diazonium salt.

vi) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation. But wait, the ring already has nitro and tert-butyl. Hmm, perhaps this is not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added at position 4 (para to amine). Then, the substituents are amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 4.

Then, vi) sulfonation would add another group, but target doesn't have that.

Hmm, this seems to be getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents.

Another approach: the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Nitro is a meta director, ethoxy and tert-butyl are ortho/para directors.

If the nitro group is introduced last, the previous substituents would be activating, making the nitration easier.

So, maybe the steps are:

1. Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce ethoxy group via some method.

3. Nitrate to add nitro group.

But wait, how would you introduce the ethoxy group? Friedel-Crafts doesn't work for ethers. So, perhaps using a different method, like the Williamson synthesis, which requires a good leaving group, but that's usually for aryl ethers, which aren't easily introduced directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly activated ring, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring is nitrated. Because nitro groups are meta directors, but if you have another group that can direct, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonation step, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the tert-butyl group, then the ethoxy group, and then the nitro group.

But how to add ethoxy group after Friedel-Crafts? Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups, not ethers.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction. Wait, in the presence of a strong activating group, like a nitro group, but nitro is deactivating.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the steps in each option again.

Looking at the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are all adjacent.

Let me imagine the order: first, add ethoxy at position 1. Then, tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). Then, nitro at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy).

But how to add ethoxy to benzene? Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds alkyl groups, not ethers. So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if the benzene ring has a good leaving group, like a nitro group, but nitro is a meta director and deactivating. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group that allows substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has activating groups.

Wait, another possibility: the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonate group, which is a good leaving group. For example, if I have a benzene ring with a sulfonic acid group, perhaps I can replace it with ethoxy via nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

So, the steps could be:

1. Add a sulfonic acid group (SO3H) to benzene.

2. Then, perform a substitution reaction with ethoxide (EtO-) to replace the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy.

But that requires a strong activating group. Wait, no, sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, substitution would be difficult without strong activating groups.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again, perhaps the correct option is D.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration of benzene. So nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduces nitro to amine. Now, amine at 1.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The amine is activating, so tert-butyl adds ortho or para to amine. Let's say position 2 (ortho).

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration again. Now, the ring has amine (activating) at 1 and tert-butyl (activating) at 2. The nitro group would be directed by the amine. So, it can go to position 3 (ortho to amine) or position 4 (para to amine).

If it goes to position 3, then substituents are amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amine at 1, forming a diazonium salt.

vi) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation. Hmm, but why sulfonate here? Alternatively, perhaps this is a step to replace the diazonium group.

Wait, after forming the diazonium salt (step v), treatment with H3O+ and heat (step viii in option D) would hydrolyze the diazonium to a hydroxyl group.

So, after step v (diazotization), the substituents are tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3, and diazonium at 1.

Then, step vi: SO3/H2SO4 is sulfonation. But why sulfonate now? Maybe it's a wrong step.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

After step iv, the ring has nitro groups? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think step by step for option D:

Starts with benzene.

i) Nitration: nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduction: nitro to amine at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: tert-butyl adds ortho or para to amine. Let's say position 2.

So now, substituents are amine at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

iv) Nitration: Nitration is done in HNO3/H2SO4. Since the ring has activating groups (amine and tert-butyl), the nitro group will be directed by the amine. So, it can go ortho (position 3) or para (position 4).

If it goes to position 3, the substituents are amine (1), tert-butyl (2), nitro (3).

v) Diazotization: amine at 1 is converted to diazonium.

vi) Sulfonation: adds a sulfonic acid group. But where? The ring is already substituted at 1,2,3. Adding another group would require a free position.

vii) Dilute H2SO4: Maybe acid workup.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to hydroxyl group. So, substituents are tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3, hydroxyl at 1.

ix) NaOH/EtBr: Perhaps this is for substituting the hydroxyl group with ethoxy. In the presence of NaOH and EtBr, the hydroxyl could be turned into ethoxy via an SN2 mechanism, but this typically requires a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl is converted to a tosylate or similar, then substituted with ethoxide.

So, after step ix, substituents are tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3, ethoxy at 1.

Which matches the target structure: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro.

So, this sequence seems to work.

Looking back at the options, let's check option D's steps:

i) Nitration
ii) Reduction (nitro to amine)
iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation
iv) Nitration again
v) Diazotization
vi) Sulfonation (maybe not needed, but in step vii, it’s dilute H2SO4)
viii) Hydrolysis to hydroxyl
ix) NaOH/EtBr to substitute hydroxyl with ethoxy

Wait, but in option D, step iv is another nitration. So, after having amine and tert-butyl, nitro would be added, which would be the third substituent.

Then, the amine is converted to diazonium, then hydrolyzed to hydroxyl, which is then replaced by ethoxy.

So, the order would be nitro, then tert-butyl, then nitro again? Or perhaps no, the second nitration adds the nitro group at position 3.

Let me recheck:

After step iii: substituents are amine (1) and tert-butyl (2).

Step iv: nitration. The nitro group is added at position 3 (ortho to amine).

So, substituents are 1 (amine), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Step v: diazotize amine at 1 → diazonium.

Step vi: sulfonate. Hmm, but where? The ring is occupied. Maybe this is a wrong step. Alternatively, perhaps after hydrolysis, the diazonium forms a hydroxyl group. So, step viii is hydrolysis, which replaces the diazonium (at 1) with a hydroxyl. So, substituents now are 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), 1 (OH).

Then, step ix: NaOH and EtBr. This would substitute the hydroxyl with ethoxy. So, OH at 1 → OCH2CH3.

Thus, the substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). Which is exactly the target.

So, the steps in option D seem to lead to the correct product.

Wait, but when in step iv, the nitro group is added, it's the second nitration. So, the molecule now has three substituents: amine, tert-butyl, and nitro. Then, the amine is converted to diazonium, which is then hydrolyzed to hydroxyl, and then substituted with ethoxy.

So, the correct order of substitution is:

1. Nitro at 1.

2. Amine from nitro reduction.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl at 2.

4. Nitration adds nitro at 3.

Wait, but that would be two nitro groups, which the target doesn't have. Hmm, that's a problem. Oh wait, no: in step iv, it's another nitration, but in the presence of the amine (activating) and tert-butyl (activating).

Wait, no, in step iv, it's the second nitration. So, the first nitro was at 1, and the second nitro is at 3. So, the target has only one nitro group, so this would lead to two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

Ah, that's a problem. So option D isn't correct.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps in step iv of option D, the nitration is not adding a third group, but replacing something. No, nitration adds a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps in option D, the nitration in step iv adds the nitro group in position 3, but in the target, we only have one nitro group. So, that would not be correct.

Hmm, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, going back to the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

It has nitro at position 3. So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy group.

Wait, but how to introduce the ethoxy group? Maybe via a substitution reaction after a leaving group is introduced.

Another idea: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strongly activated ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitration (add nitro at position 3).

2. Then introduce ethoxy group.

3. Then introduce tert-butyl group.

But nitro is a meta-director, so ethoxy would be meta to nitro, which is position 1. Then, tert-butyl would be introduced ortho to ethoxy (position 2) or para (position 4). If it's position 2, that matches the target.

But how to introduce ethoxy after nitration. Because nitro is deactivating, substitution becomes difficult.

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But ethoxy is activating, so nitro would be directed by it.

Wait, let me think: introducing ethoxy first. Benzene → ethoxybenzene.

Then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl group ortho or para to ethoxy. Let's say it goes to position 2 (ortho).

Now, substituents are ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

Then, nitration: directed by ethoxy (activating, ortho/para). So nitro group can go to position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl, which is ortho to ethoxy) or position 4 (para to ethoxy). If it goes to position 3, the substituents are at 1,2,3, which is the target.

So, this sequence would be:

1. Ethoxylation.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

3. Nitration.

But how to ethylate benzene? Because Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds alkyl groups, not ethers. So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a different method, like using an electrophilic substitution with an ethyl group, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a sulfonic acid group that is subsequently replaced.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option B is the correct one.

Option B steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts t-butyl.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl (reduction of nitro to amine).

iv) Nitration again.

v) Diazotization.

vi) Hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) Sulfonation.

ix) Dilute H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps in this option, after the first nitration, the nitro is at meta to t-butyl. Then, reduction to amine, then another nitration, which would be in the ortho position relative to the amine.

But this seems to add multiple nitro groups, which isn't desired.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which option correctly introduces the substituents in the right order.

Another approach: the correct sequence should introduce the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be correctly positioned.

Since the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are both activating, their presence would help in the nitration step.

But the nitro group is a deactivating group, so it's better to introduce it last.

So, the order should be: t-butyl, ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy. Because Friedel-Crafts doesn't introduce ethers.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification after introducing a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce a leaving group (like a nitro group) which can be replaced by ethoxy.

But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced last via a nucleophilic substitution after a sulfonic acid group is added, which can be replaced.

Wait, going back to option D:

After nitration, reduction, alkylation, nitration, diazotization, sulfonation, etc. The possible issue is the presence of two nitro groups, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, in option D, the first nitration is step i, which adds nitro at position 1. Step ii reduces it to amine. Then, step iii adds t-butyl at position 2. Then, step iv nitrates again, adding nitro at position 3 (directed by amine). So the ring now has amine at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Then, step v: diazotization of amine at 1. Step vi: sulfonation? Not sure why. Step vii: dilute H2SO4. Step viii: hydrolysis of diazonium to OH. So substituents are t-butyl (2), nitro (3), OH (1). Step ix: substitution with EtBr and NaOH, replacing OH with OEt. So, substituents are OEt (1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3), which matches the target.

Ah! So, the second nitration in option D's step iv adds the nitro group at position 3, not the first nitration. So, the first nitro is at 1, but after reduction, it's an amine. Then, the second nitration adds nitro at 3.

So, in this case, the nitro group at 3 is correct. The nitro at 1 is reduced to amine, which is then converted to OH, and then substituted with ethoxy.

So, the correct substituents are:

After step iii: amine at 1, t-butyl at 2.

After step iv: nitro at 3.

After step v: diazonium at 1.

After step viii: hydroxyl at 1.

After step ix: ethoxy at 1.

So, the substituents are ethoxy (1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3). Which is the target.

So, this sequence works. So, option D is the correct sequence.

Wait, but option D's step iv is HNO3/H2SO4, which is nitration. So, after having amine (1) and t-butyl (2), the nitro group is added at position 3.

So, yes, the order leads to the target.

Thus, the correct answer is option D.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in an order that ensures proper directing effects and avoids complications with deactivating groups. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** adds a tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **Nitration** adds a nitro group at the meta position relative to tert-butyl.
3. **Sulfonation** adds a sulfonic acid group, which is strongly deactivating and complicates further substitution.
4. Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution, but the introduction of a sulfonic acid group makes this sequence unsuitable for the target molecule.

### Option B:
1. **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** adds a tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **Nitration** adds a nitro group at the meta position relative to tert-butyl.
3. **Reduction** converts the nitro group to an amine.
4. **Nitration again** adds another nitro group, which is not desired as the target molecule has only one nitro group.
5. Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution, but the introduction of a second nitro group makes this sequence incorrect.

### Option C:
1. **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** adds a tert-butyl group to benzene.
2. **Sulfonation** adds a sulfonic acid group, which is strongly deactivating and complicates further substitution.
3. **Nitration** adds a nitro group, but the presence of the sulfonic acid group makes this step difficult.
4. Subsequent steps involve reduction, diazotization, and substitution, but the sulfonic acid group remains, which is not part of the target molecule.

### Option D:
1. **Nitration** adds a nitro group at position 1.
2. **Reduction** converts the nitro group at position 1 to an amine.
3. **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** adds a tert-butyl group at position 2 (ortho to the amine).
4. **Nitration again** adds a nitro group at position 3 (ortho to the amine and meta to the ethoxy group to be introduced later).
5. **Diazotization** converts the amine at position 1 to a diazonium salt.
6. **Hydrolysis** converts the diazonium salt at position 1 to a hydroxyl group.
7. **Substitution** replaces the hydroxyl group at position 1 with an ethoxy group using NaOH and EtBr.

This sequence ensures that the substituents are introduced in the correct order and positions to match the target molecule: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3.
