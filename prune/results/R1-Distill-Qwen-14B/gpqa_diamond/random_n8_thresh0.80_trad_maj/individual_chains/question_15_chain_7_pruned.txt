Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. They've already found these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives them the minimum masses and orbital periods. Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits.

Additionally, the host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but they have the same radii? That's interesting because usually a more massive star might be larger, but maybe it's a bit evolved or something elseâ€”like, since Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, maybe it's a subgiant or something, but same radius.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But wait, the RV method already tells us that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough for it to have caused the RV signal, right? Because RV detects planets through Doppler shifts, which requires a certain minimum inclination. But wait, no, RV can detect planets regardless of inclination because it's about the star's velocity towards and away from us. Oh, no, actually, wait. RV detects planets even if the inclination isn't exactly edge-on, because as the planet orbits, the star moves toward and away from us regardless. But the RV method gives a minimum mass, because the actual mass could be higher depending on the inclination. Oh right, because if the planet's orbit is edge-on (i.e., inclination i=90 degrees), then the RV method gives the true mass. If it's more face-on, the RV signal is smaller, so the minimum mass is lower.

But in this question, both planets have the same masses detected via RV. So that suggests that their RV-determined masses are the same. But wait, since RV gives a minimum mass (M sin i), if both planets have the same M sin i, but their true masses might be different depending on their inclinations. Hmm, but maybe that's a detail not needed here because the planets are Earth-like, so perhaps we can assume the same mass and that the RV gives the true mass, implying that their inclinations are such that sin i is the same for both. Or perhaps that's complicating things more than needed.

Wait, the question says both have the same masses, so perhaps the RV method already accounts for that, meaning their sini is the same, so their actual masses are same, or perhaps same minimum masses but perhaps different true masses. But since the question states both have same masses, I think we can proceed without worrying about that.

The key factors for transit probability are the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment (i.e., the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight). The more edge-on the orbit, the higher the chance of a transit. But since both planets have already been detected via RV, that tells us that their orbits must be at least somewhat edge-on, because RV detects planets with any inclination, but higher chances for more edge-on. Wait, no: RV can detect planets at any inclination, but the probability of detecting a planet via RV depends on the inclination because for a given mass, a more edge-on orbit (i.e., higher sin i) gives a larger RV signal. So for a planet with a given mass, if it's more edge-on, it's more likely to be detected via RV. But in this question, both planets were already detected via RV, so perhaps their inclinations are such that we have the same M sin i. But since their masses are same, their sin i is same, so their true masses would be same, but maybe their orbital inclinations are same?

Wait, but RV gives M sin i. So if both planets have same M sin i, but their actual masses are same, then their sin i is same, so their orbits are at the same inclination.

But wait, the question says, "both of
