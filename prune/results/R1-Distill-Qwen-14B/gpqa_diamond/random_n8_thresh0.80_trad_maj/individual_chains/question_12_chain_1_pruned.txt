Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles. 

Let me read the question again. It says, Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and nu. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Wait, so the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But since the neutrino is massless or has negligible mass, maybe that's an assumption here. Oh right, in particle physics, neutrinos are considered massless for these kinds of problems. So the muon and neutrino would have equal magnitude momenta but opposite directions.

But how does that help me find their kinetic energies? I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum. Let's think about energy conservation first. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy would be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, right? So E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu. And the neutrino's energy would be just its kinetic energy because it's massless, so E_nu = K_nu.

So the total energy after decay is (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu. And this should equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So equation one is 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6. That simplifies to K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

Now, for momentum conservation. The initial momentum is zero, so the sum of the momenta of mu and nu must be zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. Since neutrino is massless, its momentum magnitude is E_nu / c, because for massless particles, E = pc. So p_nu = K_nu / c. Similarly, the muon's momentum is given by sqrt( (m_mu c^2)^2 + (p_mu c)^2 ) / c^2 or something like that? Wait, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v, but maybe it's easier to use the relation p^2 c^2 = (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2. So for the muon, E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. So p_mu = sqrt( E_mu^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, no, units might be confusing. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. So E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ), and p_mu = sqrt( E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 ).

But the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|. Since p_nu = E_nu (because for neutrino, p=E when c=1?), then p_mu = E_nu. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the momentum equations. Since p_mu = -p_nu, their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|. But p_nu = E_nu (because E^2 = p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4; m=0 for neutrino, so E=pc). So |p_nu| = E_nu / c. Wait no, using units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = E_nu.

But the muon's momentum is related to its energy and mass. So |p_mu| = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu)^2 ). And since this equals E_nu, we have sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu)^2 ) = E_nu.

But E_mu is 105.7 + K_mu. Wait, no. Wait, E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu, but in the units where c=1, E is in MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

So let's substitute E_mu:

sqrt( (105.7 + K_mu)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) = E_nu.

Simplify the left side:

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 - (105.7)^2 = (2 * 105.7 * K_mu) + (K_mu)^2. So sqrt( 211.4 * K_mu + (K_mu)^2 ) = E_nu.

But from equation one, E_nu = 33.9 - K_mu, because K_mu + E_nu =33.9.

Wait, no. Wait, equation one said K_mu + K_nu =33.9, because total energy after decay is 139.6, and 105.7 (muon's rest) + K_mu + K_nu =139.6. So K_nu=33.9 - K_mu.

But E_nu is K_nu, since neutrino has zero rest mass. So E_nu =
