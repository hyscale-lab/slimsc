Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, the question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, let's think about what I know. The speed of light in a medium is generally v_medium = c / n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? So if the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I remember something about the Doppler effect, but that's usually for sound or electromagnetic waves when there's relative motion between the source and the observer. But wait, Doppler shift affects the frequency and wavelength, not necessarily the speed. Or does it?

Wait, no, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Oh wait wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is not necessarily c. Oh, right, because in this problem, the medium is glass with index of refraction n, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed in the lab frame?

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam? Hmm, maybe that's important. Let me think.

So, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. Let me visualize this. The glass is moving in the direction the light is going, but the light is moving toward the observer as well. Wait no, the glass is moving toward the observer, but in the same direction as the beam. So perhaps the beam is moving toward the observer, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. Hmm, maybe that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as the glass moving towards the observer, and the light in the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beamâ€”so from the
