Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same minimum mass because they were detected via the RV method. Their orbital periods are different, though. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's is about 33 days. 

They both have circular orbits, which I think is important because that affects the probability of a transit. Oh right, because if the orbit is circular, the chance depends on the alignment relative to our line of sight.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is more massive—twice as much as Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, how does that happen? Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So even though it's less massive, maybe it's a subgiant or something, but same radius as the more massive main-sequence star. 

The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher transit probability to maximize their chance of observing a transit. Which one is that?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by a formula that involves the size of the planet's orbit and the size of the star. Oh right, the formula is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?), but wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is approximately equal to (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), the formula simplifies to P = (R_star / a_planet) * something else? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think I remember that the transit probability is also dependent on the orbital distance. The formula I'm trying to recall is P = (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M*)^(1/3))) ), but that's more for the Doppler method's detection probability. Hmm, no, maybe that's not it.

Wait, no, the transit probability for a given planet is P = (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (b²)))), where b is the impact parameter. But wait, that's
