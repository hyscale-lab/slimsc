Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I need to figure out what's happening here. Let me think through it step by step.

So, the setup is Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to get the sample compartment to an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, so there shouldn't be many gas molecules around. But even at that, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules under these conditions, which is λ1. The mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is the pressure. So, lower pressure (which he achieved) would mean a longer mean free path, which makes sense because gases spread out more, so particles don't collide as often.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, he observes something about the mean free path changing. The mean free path becomes λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. What else could affect the mean free path?

Wait, the electron beam is probably introducing some sort of energy into the system. Maybe it's causing the gas molecules to ionize or get excited. Or perhaps it's heating the molecules, but the question says the temperature remained the same, so maybe not thermal effects. 

Oh! Another possibility: the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to become charged. If the gas particles are now ions or electrons, they might start interacting with the electron beam or the microscope components in a different way. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. If the gas particles are charged, maybe they interact more or less with each other. But wait, in a vacuum, the primary cause of collisions is the gas molecules bumping into each other. If the electron beam is causing some molecules to have charges, perhaps they attract or repel each other more, changing the collision rate.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be excited or ionized, leading to a change in the effective pressure. Or, wait, the beam might be disturbing the vacuum, like increasing the effective pressure because the electrons could be influencing the gas in some way.

Wait, but the pressure is already ultra-low. The mean free path λ1 was calculated based on that. When he turns on the beam, perhaps he's introducing more particles into the system. No, Mike already accounted for the gas particles in the compartment. Or maybe the beam is causing some of the gas molecules to be knocked out or ionized, effectively reducing the number of gas particles, which would increase the mean free path. But that would make λ2 larger than λ1. But the options don't have that directly. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move faster. If the gas molecules' velocity increases, their mean free path would increase because they're moving faster and might not collide as often. But wait, in the equation for mean free path, λ is proportional to temperature (since k*T is in the numerator). Since the temperature is the same, maybe the velocity isn't changing.

Wait, wait, another thought:
