Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the substituents on the benzene ring. The numbering is a bit tricky here. Let me try to sketch this out. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the benzene ring with positions 1, 2, and 3 adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement. Wait, no, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so positions 1,2,3 are in a row—like a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But that's not possible because in a benzene ring, three substituents can't all be adjacent; maybe it's a 1,2,3-tri substitution, but perhaps it's an ortho, meta arrangement. Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the directing effects of the substituents and how the substitutions would occur step by step. So, benzene is starting material. The substituents are -OEt, -t-Bu, and -NO2. Wait, but wait—what's the order of adding these groups?

Wait, I think the substituents on benzene have different directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky group but also a meta director because it's an alkyl group (since t-butyl is a strong activating group, but wait, t-butyl is actually a strong activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Wait, no, wait: wait, no, actually, t-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl substit
