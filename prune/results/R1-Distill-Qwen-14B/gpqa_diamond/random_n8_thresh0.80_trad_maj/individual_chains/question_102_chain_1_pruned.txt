Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. Let me first understand what's going on here.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The person is trying to study their developmental fate. They created a bicistronic vector, which I remember means it has two coding regions in one construct. The vector has lox-Cre sites and stop cassettes.

So the vector structure is like this: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream, so IRES elements usually allow for internal ribosome entry, which can drive expression of the downstream gene, perhaps in a different cell type or under different conditions.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that the loxP site is recognized by Cre recombinase, which can excise the stop cassette if the right conditions are met. Lox2272 is a variant that can recombine with loxP in the presence of Cre, I think.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins for Western blot. Actin is used as a loading control, and the signal is proportional to that. So if the proteins are expressed, they should show up on the blot.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for their construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and the Cre is probably under its control. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest derivatives, like in the cells where SOX10 is active.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal, which would come from eGFP. But they didn't see any green. The question is why.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I don't see how that would prevent eGFP expression. The question is about the expression in the mouse, so maybe the expression isn't happening because the construct isn't working, not necessarily the mode of signaling.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is a reporter, so if it's stuck, it might not be expressed on the cell surface. But why would that happen? The vector design includes the stop cassette with lox sites. If Cre isn't active, the stop would prevent expression. But the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, so in the neural crest cells, Cre should be active. So if the stop is not excised, the receptor won't be expressed, hence no eGFP. But stuck in the Golgi would be about trafficking, not expression.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. So the CBA promoter is probably strong, but without an enhancer, maybe expression isn't driven. But the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor has IRES, which doesn't require enhancers as much. But the problem is that the mouse was made with the construct, so the enhancers should be present. Unless the construct doesn't have the necessary regulatory elements. Hmm, but the vectors are designed with promoters and IRES, so maybe this isn't the issue.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette isn't removed, the receptor isn't expressed. But if the lox sites are correct and Cre is active, the stop should be excised. Alternatively, if the construct is not correctly spliced, the ORF might be messed up. Wait, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the stop cassette's removal didn't happen, the receptor won't be expressed. So in the mouse, without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place. But when they cross with SOX10-Cre, Cre should excise the stops, allowing expression.

Wait, let me think about the vector structure. The ligand is at 5', and the stop is between ligand and mCherry. The receptor is at 3', and its stop is between receptor and eGFP. So for the ligand, the CBA promoter drives its expression. Since the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop is in between, unless Cre is present, mCherry won't be expressed because the stop is there. But I think in the vector, the stop is in a loxP cassette, so without Cre, the stop remains, preventing expression. With Cre, the stop is excised, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together.

For the receptor, the IRES is upstream. IRES elements allow the ribosome to translate the downstream ORF without a stop in between. Wait, no. Wait, the setup is that the receptor ORF is after the IRES. So the IRES would drive the translation of the receptor, even if the ligand isn't expressed? Or perhaps the IRES is for the receptor. The IRES is a regulatory element that allows internal initiation of translation. So the receptor would be expressed under the control of the IRES, regardless of the ligand's expression. But in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after
