Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about IR and NMR spectroscopy. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about identifying Compound X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The product is one of the four options given. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI elimination reaction, which typically converts alcohols into alkenes. Wait, no, wait—I think that's when you have an alcohol reacting with HI and H2SO4, maybe? Or was it something else? Oh right, I think the specific reaction here is the hydrolysis of an epoxide, but wait, no, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, which I recall are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction. Or maybe it's the reaction to eliminate an alcohol to form an alkene. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: when alcohols are treated with a strong acid like HI and maybe H2O, it can lead to substitution. Oh wait, no, red phosphorus is often used with HI for the substitution of alcohols to form alkenes via the elimination. Or maybe it's the conversion of an alkoxy group into an alcohol. Wait, no, perhaps it's the cleavage of ethers. No, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think.

Wait, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Oh! I remember now. This is the reaction where a hydroxyl group (like in an ether) is replaced by iodine. Or wait, wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the formation of ylides. Oh wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an epoxide. No, that's with acid and water. Hmm. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus is used in the dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the data first before worrying about the reaction. Let's see the IR and NMR of Compound X and maybe figure out its structure first.

Compound X's IR shows strong peaks in 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is covered in the 3400-2500 range, so that might fit. But wait, the 1720 peak for a carbonyl—maybe it's an ester, because acids are usually around 1700 but can vary. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but then the O-H would be absent. Wait, but the IR has a strong peak around 3400–2500, which is O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But then the 1720 might be a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an ester. Hmm.

Wait, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So Compound X likely has an aromatic ring with
