Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. All right, let's break it down step by step.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's the form. Each particle's wave function is this. The problem says that when they measure the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right? Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe I misunderstood. The wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the given function is only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe the function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. Because if particles are only found between 1 and 3, the wave function must be zero outside that region.

But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That looks like a complex function. Wait, the wave function being a complex number is normal, but the probability is the square of the absolute value, right? So the probability density is |ψ|².

So the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, for x<1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero. So perhaps this function is valid only between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function is zero outside that interval.

But then, for the wave function to represent a valid quantum state, it must be normalized. Oh right, the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1. So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

So, first, let's compute the probability density |ψ(x)|².

The wave function is a real part plus an imaginary part. Oh wait, ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - (0.5)i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5.

The absolute square is [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]².

So |ψ(x)|² = [a² / (1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the probability density is a²/(1+x) + 0.25, between x=1 and x=3. And zero outside.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, split it into two integrals:

Integral a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + integral 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute the first integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/
