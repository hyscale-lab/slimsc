Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when bromoalkanes react with KOH, it's usually an elimination reaction, especially with two leaving groups. Oh right, vicinal dihalides with strong bases like KOH typically undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So the structure is a bridged bicyclic compound. Removing two bromides from adjacent positions would form a double bond. The product after KOH would be something like 1,3-adamantadiene or maybe 1,3-diene. But the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Hmm, 4.79 is around where an alkene's protons would be, but wait, that's actually more like the region for an alcohol or maybe an ether, but considering the IR, which has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the product is formed by heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, that's dehydrobromination. But if it's a dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination. Oh wait, that would form an alkene. But then product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H). Alkenes' protons are usually around 5-6 ppm, but maybe this is an exception. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. Wait, how?

Oh, wait a minute. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me step back. KOH is a strong base. When a dihalide (vicinal) is treated with a strong base, it can lead to elimination, forming a double bond. But in some cases, especially with bulky bases or if the structure doesn't allow easy elimination, it might not form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing some kind of substitution.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How could that happen? Oh, wait, maybe it's a double elimination followed by a rearrangement. Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically results in alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, no, elimination usually leads to alkenes or alkynes. Maybe the dihalide is converted into a ketone via some mechanism. Hmm. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a cage-like structure with four cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent bridgeheads.

Heating with KOH would probably abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr twice. So the product would have a double bond. But why the IR shows a carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone? I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh, wait! 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a ring-opening upon treatment with KOH, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought. If the initial reaction is elimination, forming an alkene, then the product is an adamantadiene. Then, when product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. But where would that happen? Unless product 1 is an alkene that can undergo some cyclization.

Wait, but product 1 is then heated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.
