Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The problem mentions using the EW method, which I think stands for equivalent width, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. The key seems to be about the elemental abundances determined via LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

The given data for the stars are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Oh wait, the photospheric composition of the Sun is also provided. For the Sun:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5
- Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, or is it 12 + the log equals that number? So yeah, nFe/nH is 10^(7.5-12) = 10^-4.5.

But wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

But how do I get that from the given data?

Let me recall what the brackets mean. The notation [X/Y] is log10(n_X / n_Y), where n is number density. But wait, sometimes it's relative to the Sun. Wait, no, I think [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So actually, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun).

Wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y]_star is defined as log10
