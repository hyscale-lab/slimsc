Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Let me try to process it step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a construct that includes the coding sequence for this protein, with an added influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But when they check the expression, the protein isn't overexpressing as expected. So, they're trying to figure out why.

The question provides the sequence of the plus strand of their construct, and the options are possible reasons for the failure. I need to look at the sequence and see if there's an issue that would prevent proper expression.

First, let's think about how the construct should be. They added an HA tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag is a small peptide sequence, usually added to the beginning of a protein for detection purposes. So the construct should start with the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, the first part is 5' ATG TAC... So the start codon is ATG, which is correct for initiating translation. But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the first few amino acids after the start should be the HA epitope. Let me check the DNA sequence.

The first part after ATG is TAC. Let's translate that. TAC is the codon for tyrosine (Tyr). The HA tag's amino acid sequence is usually something like YPYDVPVY (if it's the HA tag from influenza). So the first codon after the start should be tyrosine, then proline, tyrosine, etc. But wait, the initial part might vary depending on how the tag is inserted.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence is the coding sequence for those amino acids. The HA tag is usually added as a short peptide, so the coding sequence would be TAC GAT GTC, etc. Let me write out the beginning of the provided DNA sequence and see what's there.

The sequence starts:
5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Breaking it down into triplets:
ATG (start)
TAC (Tyr)
CCA (Pro)
TAC (Tyr)
GAT (Asp)
GTT (Val)
CCAGAT (but wait, maybe I should group them correctly. Let me count from the start:

1. ATG
2. TAC
3. CCA
4. TAC
5. GAT
6. GTT
7. CCA
8. GAT
9. TAC
10. GCC
11. AAA
12. TGA

Wait, that's 12 codons. Let me see what these translate to:

ATG: Methionine (Met)
TAC: Tyr
CCA: Pro
TAC: Tyr
GAT: Asp
GTT: Val
CCA: Pro
GAT: Asp
TAC: Tyr
GCC: Ala
AAA: Lys
TGA: Stop (Tyr in some organisms, but in most, TGA is a stop codon)

Wait, the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. That's a problem because the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the GADD45G coding sequence would follow. But here, the construct starts with ATG and then a bunch of codons, ending with TGA. So perhaps the HA tag is inserted incorrectly, leading to a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted in a way that introduces a stop codon within the coding sequence. Let's think about the intended structure. The vector probably has a multiple cloning site (MCS) where the insert is placed. The insert should be the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, all under the control of a promoter.

If the construct in the question starts with ATG and then the HA tag, but the first few codons include a stop codon, that would cause the ribosome to terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein (the HA tag alone) or no protein if the stop is in the HA.

Wait, the sequence provided is the coding strand. Let's think: the construct should be in the same reading frame as the HA tag. Let me look at the first few codons again.

ATG (start) followed by TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), etc. Wait, that's the start of the HA tag. The HA tag is usually YPYDVPVYI (where Y is Tyr, P is Pro, D is Asp, V is Val, etc.), so the DNA sequence would be TAC (Tyr) CCA (Pro) TAC (Tyr) GAT (Asp) GTT (Val) CCA (Pro) GAT (Asp) TAC (Tyr) GCC (Ala) AAA (Lys) TTA (Leu) GCT (Ala)... Hmm, but in the provided sequence, after the initial part, the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop.

So that's 12 codons, starting with ATG, then 11 more, and then TGA. Let me see: 11 codons after the start. Let's count the nucleotides. Each codon is 3 nt.

ATG is 3 nt. The HA tag is about 11 amino acids, but perhaps here the HA sequence is only part of that.

Wait, I think the key problem is that the HA tag might not have been correctly inserted. Let me check the first 30 nucleotides.

The sequence is:
5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... 

Breaking into codons:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. TAC (Tyr)
10. GCC (Ala)
11. AAA (Lys)
12. TGA (Stop)

So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop. That's a problem because the HA tag is supposed to be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. So the presence of a stop codon in the middle of the HA tag would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, producing a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Wait, but the HA tag is usually short, maybe 10-12 amino acids. So if in the construct, the HA tag includes a stop codon, the translation would terminate there. So the construct would produce the HA tag (maybe up to the stop codon), and then the rest of the GADD45G gene would not be translated because the stop codon is in the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in a way that disrupts the reading frame, leading to a frameshift. But in this case, the stop codon is in frame, so the ribosome would stop at TGA.

So, looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated the translation early. That could be because a stop codon was introduced in the middle of the HA tag. So the HA tag would be translated and then the ribosome stops, leading to no expression of the GADD45G. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift, but in this case, the stop codon is in the same frame.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is inserted, but the sequence after that (the GADD45G coding sequence) might not be in frame, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, looking at the sequence, after TGA, the next codon is TGG (since the sequence continues as TGA GAC ... Wait, no, let me see the full sequence again.

Wait, the sequence after the first 12 codons:

After the TGA (stop), the next part is GAC ... Let's see:

Looking at the original sequence: ... TGA CAG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the codons.

Wait, the initial sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write the initial part as a string of 3s:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, wait, the first 36 nucleotides:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the HA tag is inserted correctly but the next codon is a stop, preventing the rest of the GADD45G from being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is inserted in a way that creates a stop codon in the HA, so the ribosome stops, leading to no full-length HA-GADD45G being made. So the construct would produce a small peptide (maybe the HA tag up to the stop), but not the full-length protein.

So, in the options:

Option B is "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would be the case if a stop codon is present in the HA coding sequence, causing the ribosome to stop before the GADD45G is expressed. So the construct would produce a truncated protein or no protein, leading to no overexpression.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But in reality, UAA is a standard stop codon and all cells have mechanisms to recognize it. So D is unlikely.

Option A: HA sequence has a missense mutation. Well, if the HA sequence had a mutation, the protein would still be expressed but not recognized by antibodies. But the question is about overexpression, not detection. So A is probably not the main issue here.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag and the GADD45G are directly connected without a linker, maybe proteases would cleave. But the issue here is that the protein isn't expressed at all, not that it's being degraded after expression. So C might not explain the lack of expression.

So the main issue seems to be that the stop codon is present in the HA coding sequence, causing premature termination. Therefore, the answer should be B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with an HA determinant at the N-terminus, failed to overexpress the protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand was analyzed to determine the cause.

The sequence starts with the start codon `ATG`, followed by `TAC`, `CCA`, `TAC`, `GAT`, `GTT`, and so on. Translating these codons reveals that the 12th codon is `TGA`, which is a stop codon. This stop codon appears prematurely in the sequence, disrupting the translation of the full-length HA-GADD45G protein. As a result, the ribosome terminates translation early, leading to the production of a truncated protein or no protein at all, which explains the lack of overexpression.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA sequence would result in an altered HA tag but would not prevent the translation of the full-length protein. Since the issue is lack of overexpression, this is unlikely to be the cause.
- **Option B**: The premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the HA coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early. This prevents the full-length HA-GADD45G protein from being expressed, aligning with the observed failure in overexpression.
- **Option C**: A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis of the nascent chain, but the issue here is the complete absence of protein expression, not degradation after expression. Thus, this is not the primary cause.
- **Option D**: The tRNA for the `UAA` codon (a stop codon) is universally present in cells, so its absence is not a plausible explanation.

The most likely explanation is that the premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the HA coding sequence caused the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length protein.

**Answer: B**
