Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a reaction mechanism question, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The first part is about the reaction of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second part is about 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I need to figure out the major products A and B, and match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A:

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl). Wait, wait. Wait, the numbering: cyclohexanone is position 1. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached. Position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, a CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl) group at C2, and a methyl group at C2 and C6.

When such a ketone reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, I think it's a Michael addition or maybe an aldol reaction. Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So the base (t-BuOK) would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone.

Wait, in a Michael addition, the enolate acts as a nucleophile attacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the ketone here would form an enolate, which then attacks the ethyl acrylate.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-type addition. Wait, no, Claisen is between esters. Maybe it's more like a conjugate addition.

But another possibility is that the cyclohexanone forms an enolate, which then adds to the acrylate. Let's think about the regiochemistry.

So, the ketone is at C1. The substituents around the ring are C2 (Et and Me), C6 (Me), and C3 and C5 would be CH2 groups, I think. So when the base deprotonates the alpha carbon, which would be at C2 or C6, but looking at the structure, C2 has an ethyl and methyl, making it more substituted. The enolate would form at the less substituted position? Or where the deprotonation is easiest.

Wait, the alpha carbons are at C2 and C6. C2 is attached to two substituents (ethyl and methyl), so perhaps the enolate forms at C6, which only has a methyl group. Because the base tends to deprotonate the less hindered alpha position. So the enolate would form at C6, making the enolate at that position.

Then, the enolate would attack the ethyl acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The enolate (from C6) would attack the beta carbon (the one further from the ester), adding the cyclohexyl group there.

Wait, but the cyclohexanone has substituents at C2 and C6. So when the enolate forms at C6, the attack would add the acrylate to that position, which is next to the ketone. Wait, but when the enolate attacks, it adds across the double bond, so the ester would add to C6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The cyclohexanone has a ketone at C1. The enolate forms when the base abstracts an alpha proton. The possible alpha positions are C2 and C6. Enolates form where the deprotonation is most favorable, which is usually the less substituted position because
