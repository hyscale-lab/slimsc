Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and with multiple rings. So 1,3-dibromo implies that there are bromine atoms on two of the bridges. When heated with excess KOH, this compound undergoes elimination, probably forming an alkene. 

Wait, elimination reactions typically form alkenes. So in the presence of a strong base like KOH, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose HBr from each bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond. I think the product would be a diene, but adamantane has a specific structure. Alternatively, since there are two bromines, maybe it forms a single double bond where the two carbons each lose a bromine and a hydrogen.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. Hmm, 1720 is a carbonyl stretch. Wait, but elimination would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Oh wait, wait! KOH is a strong base, but if it's in aqueous solution, perhaps it's an elimination followed by something else. Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then what about the carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe the product isn't just an alkene.

Wait, 1720 cm^-1 suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If it's treated with KOH, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxides are formed from vicinal dihalides with a base, but the carbonyl in IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form an enol, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes more than elimination can happen. Oh! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but then in the presence of water, it could form a diol? No, because KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in that sense.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the steps. Let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, it's an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? But then why the IR peak at 1720?

Wait, unless the initial product is an epoxide. No, epoxides require a peracid or other conditions. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is formed, but then there's some rearrangement or oxidation. Oh! Wait, maybe the initial reaction is elimination to form a double bond, but then further oxidation occurs. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an alkene, but then in KOH, maybe some diels-alder type reaction, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The product's IR has a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial product is a diol? No, diols would have OH stretches around 3200-3500, but the IR shows 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit with the IR data. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group formed via elimination. Wait, no, elimination usually forms a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some other process. Hmm.

Wait another angle. Let's look at the NMR. The 4.79 ppm peak is probably a methylene group (2H) that's deshielded, maybe near an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 ppm region is 10H, which seems like a lot. Maybe that's the adamantane ring's CH groups. The 1.94 ppm is another 2H, maybe another methylene.

If the IR is 1720, maybe it's a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How could that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Maybe via a elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann is for amines. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the
