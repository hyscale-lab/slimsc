Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let's see.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6 (Li-6), since 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals a mass number of 6. Got that.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, and their kinetic energy becomes significant. So I need to calculate the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, wait. Oh, wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think in particle physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, I think in colliders, they often quote the kinetic energy of the particles. Or maybe the total energy, including rest mass. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So perhaps it's the kinetic energy? Or the total energy? I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

In relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The gamma factor depends on the velocity. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma first.

So v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. Let's see, 96*96 is 9216, so 0.96² is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. Oh, that's neat. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857. Hmm, that's about 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * m c². But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. In accelerators, the energy typically refers to the kinetic energy. So I need to be careful. The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, but the initial energy of the nucleus is its rest energy, so the kinetic energy is the extra energy given to it. So if the collider provides energy E, which is the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma - 1) m c². Alternatively, if the question is asking for the total energy, including rest mass, then E = gamma m c².

I think the problem is likely asking for the kinetic energy. Because in collider experiments, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. Wait, but sometimes they refer to the total energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to remember. In particle physics, when they say the energy of a proton in the LHC is 6.5 TeV, that's the total energy, not just kinetic. Because the rest mass is negligible but not zero. Wait, wait, no. For protons, the rest mass is about 938 MeV, and their kinetic energy is much higher. So in that case, the total energy is much larger than the rest mass. So in that case, the energy given is the total energy. But I'm not 100% sure for this problem.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c". So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, which would allow the speed to reach 0.96c. Or maybe it's the total energy. Hmm, I think it's the total energy. Because the speed is a function of the energy, which in relativity terms, you need the gamma factor.

So let's proceed under the assumption that the question is asking for the total energy, i.e., E = gamma * m c². If that's the case, then I can compute that.

But first, I need the mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but to get the mass in kilograms, I can use the conversion factor 1 u ≈ 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u is 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 9.963234e-27 kg.

Alternatively, I can compute the rest energy in electron volts. I know that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest energy of Li-6 is 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6 * 931.5 = approximately 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. So m c² is about 5.589 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV. Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.589 = let's see. 3 * 5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 *5.589 ≈ 3.193. So total is about 16.767 +3.193 ≈ 19.96 GeV. Wait, 3.5714 is approximately 25/7, which is about 3.5714.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Compute 3.5714 * 5.589:

Calculate 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857.
3.5714 * 0.589 = let's compute that.

3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857.
3.5714 * 0.08 = 0.285712.
3.5714 * 0.009 = 0.0321426.

Adding those: 1.7857 + 0.285712 = 2.071412 + 0.0321426 = 2.1035546.

So 3.5714 *5.589 = 17.857 + 2.1035546 ≈ 19.96055 GeV.

So approximately 19.96 GeV. Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, my calculation gives around 19.96 GeV, which is close to option C, 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

The gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96^2: 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. 0.0784 is 784/10000, so sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(784/10000)=28/100=0.28. So yes, gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass energy. Let me recompute that.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.012 u. Wait, more precisely, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01219875 u (I think). So perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass.

Wait, actually, the exact mass number is 6, but the actual mass is slightly less than 6 u because of binding energy. Oh wait, no, the atomic mass includes the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons. Wait, no, for a nucleus, the mass is given as the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, the problem says "nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons." So the nucleus is Li-6. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.012 u (I might be misremembering the exact value). Let me get the exact value.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01219875 u. So the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6.0122 u.

But wait, the atomic mass includes the electrons. For a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the atomic number. Li has Z=3, so 3 electrons. So the mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons.

The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be approximately 0.0016457 u.

So the mass of Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.01219875 u - 0.0016457 u = 6.010553 u.

Wait, but that's a very small correction. Let me compute the rest mass energy more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the rest mass in kilograms and then compute gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the exact value for the rest mass in GeV/c².

I know that 1 u is about 931.494 MeV/c². So 6.012 u would be 6.012 * 931.494 MeV = let's see.

6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.012 *931.494 = 11.177928 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 + 11.177928 ≈ 559, 559, wait 5588.964 +11.177928 = 559, 5590.141928 MeV, which is 5.590141928 GeV.

But wait, I think I should consider the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is about 6.01219875 u. So using that:

6.01219875 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.01219875 * 931.494 ≈ 0.01219875 * 931.494.

Let me compute that:

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.002 *931.494=1.862988.

0.00019875 *931.494≈ approximately 0.1846.

Adding these: 9.31494 +1.862988=11.177928 +0.1846≈11.3625 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 + 11.3625 ≈ 559, 5588.964 +11.3625 =5600.3265 MeV, which is 5.6003265 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. 5588.964 +11.3625 MeV is 559, 5588.964+11.3625=5600.3265 MeV? Wait, that can't be right because 6 u is 5588.964, and adding 11.3625 MeV brings it to ~5600 MeV, which is 5.6 GeV. That's correct.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Because 0.01219875 *931.494 = ?

Let me compute 0.01219875 *931.494:

0.01 *931.494=9.31494

0.002 *931.494=1.862988

0.00019875 *931.494 ≈ 0.00019875 *931.494 ≈ approximately 0.1846.

So adding them: 9.31494 +1.862988 = 11.177928 + 0.1846 ≈ 11.3625 MeV.

So 6.01219875 u is 6 u + 0.01219875 u. So 6 u is 5588.964 MeV, and 0.01219875 u is 11.3625 MeV. So total is 5588.964 +11.3625 = 5600.3265 MeV, which is 5.6003265 GeV.

Wait, but that can't be correct because 6 u is 5588.964 MeV, and adding 11 MeV would make it about 5600, which is more than 6 u. Oh wait, no, I think I'm confusing units. Wait, no—no, I think I'm correct. Because 6 u is 6 *931.494 MeV=5588.964 MeV, and the 0.01219875 u adds about 11 MeV, so the total is about 5600 MeV, which is 5.6 GeV. Hmm, okay.

Wait, but wait: 6 u is 6 *931.494 MeV = 5588.964 MeV. The 0.01219875 u is 0.01219875 *931.494 MeV. Let me compute that precisely.

0.01219875 * 931.494:

= (12.19875e-3) * 931.494

= Let me compute 12 *931.494 = 11,177.928.

0.19875e-3 *931.494 = 0.00019875 *931.494 ≈ 0.1846.

So 12e-3 *931.494= 11.177928.

So 12.19875e-3 *931.494 = 11.177928 + 0.1846 ≈ 11.3625.

So yeah, 11.3625 MeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.6003265 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.6003265 GeV.

Let me calculate that.

3 *5.6003265 = 16.8009795.

0.57142857 *5.6003265.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.6003265 =2.80016325.

0.07142857 *5.6003265 ≈ let's compute 0.07 *5.6003265 ≈0.392022855.

0.00142857 *5.6003265≈ approx 0.00799996.

Adding these: 2.80016325 +0.392022855=3.192186105 +0.00799996≈3.200186.

So total E ≈16.8009795 +3.200186 =19.9999655 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20 GeV. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Because I used the atomic mass of Li-6, which includes electrons. Wait, wait a minute, did I make a mistake in the calculation of the nucleus's rest mass?

Because the problem states that X is a nucleus, so the nucleus's mass is the mass of Li-6 without the electrons. So I think I shouldn't subtract the electrons' mass because the nucleus's mass is given as the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the electrons. So to get the mass of the nucleus, you subtract the electrons. So for Li-6, which is a neutral atom, Z=3, so you have 3 electrons. So the nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus 3 * electron mass.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01219875 u. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u. So the nucleus's mass is 6.01219875 - 0.00164574 = 6.01055301 u.

So then the rest mass energy is 6.01055301 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

Let me compute that:

6.01055301 * 931.494 MeV.

Breaking it down:

6 * 931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.01055301 *931.494 MeV.

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.00055301 *931.494 ≈ approx 0.516 MeV.

So 9.31494 +0.516 ≈9.83094 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5588.964 +9.83094 =5598.79494 MeV ≈5.598795 GeV.

So approximately 5.5988 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.598795 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3 *5.598795=16.796385 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.598795.

Hmm, 0.5 *5.598795=2.7993975.

0.07142857 *5.598795 ≈ let's compute 5.598795 *0.07 =0.39191565.

0.00142857 *5.598795 ≈ approx 0.007999.

So 0.07142857 *5.598795 ≈0.39191565 +0.007999≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 *5.598795 ≈2.7993975 +0.400 ≈3.1993975 GeV.

So total E ≈16.796385 +3.1993975 ≈19.99578 GeV.

So about 20 GeV again. But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.13 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Wait, perhaps I need to compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, when v = 0.96c, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

beta = v/c = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) )= 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, no, that's correct. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me recompute that with more precise numbers.

Using the exact atomic mass of Li-6: 6.01219875 u.

Subtracting 3 electrons: 3 * 0.0005485799 u = 0.0016457397 u.

So Li-6 nucleus mass = 6.01219875 - 0.0016457397 =6.0105530103 u.

m c² =6.0105530103 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.0105530103 *931.494 = Let's compute this accurately.

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494 MeV.

0.0005530103 *931.494 ≈0.0005530103 *931.494.

Compute 0.0005 *931.494=0.465747.

0.0000530103 *931.494 ≈approx 0.0000530103 *900≈0.0477, and 0.0000530103 *31.494≈0.001668. So total ≈0.0477+0.001668≈0.049368.

So 0.0005530103 *931.494 ≈0.465747 +0.049368≈0.515115 MeV.

So 0.0105530103 *931.494 ≈9.31494 +0.515115 =9.829055 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5588.964 + 9.829055 =5598.793055 MeV, which is 5.598793055 GeV.

So m c² =5.598793055 GeV.

E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.598793055.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.598793055.

Let me compute it step by step.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.598793055.

First, compute 3.57142857 ×0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 ×0.098793055.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.09 =0.3214285713.

3.57142857 ×0.008793055 ≈0.03135714285.

So adding these:

0.3214285713 +0.03135714285 ≈0.352785714.

So 3.57142857 ×0.598793055 ≈1.785714285 +0.352785714≈2.138499999.

So total E ≈17.85714285 +2.1385 ≈19.99564285 GeV.

So approximately 19.9956 GeV, which is about 20 GeV. But the options don't have exactly 20 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, and D)21.419 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the energy is the total energy or the kinetic energy.

If the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1≈2.57142857.

So K =2.57142857 *5.598793055 GeV.

Compute this:

2 *5.598793055=11.19758611 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.598793055.

Compute 0.5 *5.598793055=2.7993965275 GeV.

0.07142857 *5.598793055≈0.400 GeV.

So 0.57142857 *5.598793055≈ 2.7993965275 +0.400 ≈3.1993965 GeV.

So K ≈11.19758611 +3.1993965≈14.3969826 GeV. Approximately 14.4 GeV. But none of the options are near that.

So the problem must be asking for the total energy, not the kinetic. So that brings me back to around 20 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) or perhaps the precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with more precise numbers. Let me do that.

Gamma is exactly 3.5714285714285714 (since 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...).

m c² is 5.598793055 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.5714285714285714 *5.598793055.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.5714285714285714 ×5.598793055.

Compute 3 *5.598793055 =16.796379165 GeV.

0.5714285714285714 ×5.598793055.

Let me compute this as:

0.5714285714285714 ×5 =2.857142857142857.

0.5714285714285714 ×0.598793055.

Wait, perhaps another approach: 0.5714285714285714 =4/7.

So 4/7 *5.598793055 = (4 *5.598793055)/7.

Compute 4 *5.598793055 =22.39517222.

Divide by 7: 22.39517222 /7 ≈3.199310317 GeV.

So 0.5714285714285714 ×5.598793055 ≈3.199310317 GeV.

Total E =16.796379165 +3.199310317 ≈19.99568948 GeV.

So about 19.9957 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the available options don't have 20 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the nucleus mass. Let me double-check that.

Li-6 has Z=3, so 3 electrons. Each electron is 0.0005485799 u. So 3 electrons is 0.0016457397 u.

Atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01219875 u.

So Li-6 nucleus mass is 6.01219875 -0.0016457397 =6.0105530103 u.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the atomic mass. Let me look it up (in my mind, as I don't have access to the internet here). The exact value for Li-6 is 6.01219875 u.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the nucleus as simply 6 u, ignoring the small difference due to electrons. Then m c² would be 6 u *931.494 MeV/u=5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

Then E=gamma *m c²=3.57142857 *5.588964≈?

Compute 3.57142857 *5.588964.

3 *5.588964=16.766892.

0.57142857 *5.588964.

0.5 *5.588964=2.794482.

0.07142857 *5.588964≈ let's compute 0.07 *5.588964=0.39122748.

0.00142857 *5.588964≈0.007987.

So 0.07142857 *5.588964≈0.39122748 +0.007987≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 *5.588964≈2.794482 +0.400≈3.194482.

So E=16.766892 +3.194482≈19.961374 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.9614 GeV. Still close to 20 GeV, which is close to option C: 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy. Perhaps the question is using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the energy is given as the kinetic energy plus the rest energy? Or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another approach: in particle physics, the energy of a proton in a collider is often given as the total energy (gamma m c²). So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

My calculation is 19.9957 GeV, which is very close to 20 GeV. The options have option C at 20.132, which is about 0.132 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial gamma calculation.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately using beta=0.96.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula, but in different units. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the formula for kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) m c².

If the total energy E is the sum of K and rest energy, then E = gamma m c² = K + m c².

But I'm confused about what the question is asking. If the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then the answer would be around 14.4 GeV, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy.

But the options don't have 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is more accurately 5.607 GeV, leading to a higher total energy.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

Let me think: The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01055301 u (as calculated earlier). So 6.01055301 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01055301 *931.494 = as before, about 9.830 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.964 +9.830=5598.794 MeV=5.598794 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.598794.

Let me compute this with more precise numbers.

3.57142857 *5.598794.

Let me compute:

3 *5.598794=16.796382.

0.57142857 *5.598794.

Compute 0.5 *5.598794=2.799397.

0.07142857 *5.598794 ≈ let's calculate:

5.598794 *0.07=0.39191558.

5.598794 *0.00142857 ≈0.00799999.

So 0.39191558 +0.00799999≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 *5.598794≈2.799397 +0.400≈3.199397.

So total E=16.796382 +3.199397=19.995779 GeV.

So approximately 19.9958 GeV, which rounds to 20.00 GeV.

But the available options don't have 20 GeV. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is 0.132 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the nucleus's mass.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus's mass is 6.012 u. So 6.012 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6.012 *931.494.

6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.012 *931.494=11.177928.

Total =5588.964 +11.177928=5600.141928 MeV=5.600141928 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.600141928.

3 *5.600141928=16.80042578.

0.57142857 *5.600141928.

0.5 *5.600141928=2.800070964.

0.07142857 *5.600141928≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 *5.600141928≈2.800070964 +0.400≈3.200070964.

So E=16.80042578 +3.200070964=20.00049674 GeV.

So approximately 20.0005 GeV, which is about 20.0005 GeV.

So the precise calculation would give about 20.00 GeV.

But the options don't have 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass as 6 u, so m c²=6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.588964=3.57142857 *5.588964.

3.57142857 ×5.588964.

Let me compute:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.588964.

Calculate 3.57142857 ×0.5=1.785714285.

3.57142857 ×0.088964.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.08=0.2857142856.

3.57142857 ×0.008964≈0.0319999998.

So 0.08 part is 0.2857142856, 0.008964 part ≈0.0319999998.

So 0.088964 part: 0.2857142856 +0.0319999998≈0.3177142854.

So 3.57142857 ×0.588964≈1.785714285 +0.3177142854≈2.10342857 GeV.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.10342857≈19.96057142 GeV.

Which is about 19.9606 GeV.

Hmm, but this is getting me nowhere near 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula but in a different way. Like, maybe it's considering the rest mass as 7 u or something else. Wait, no, Li-6 is 6 u.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise numbers.

Let me try to compute E = gamma * m c².

gamma=3.5714285714285714.

m c²=5.598793055 GeV.

So E=3.5714285714285714 ×5.598793055.

Let me compute this as:

3.5714285714285714 ×5.598793055.

Let me use a calculator-like approach.

3.5714285714285714 ×5.598793055.

= (3 +0.5 +0.0714285714285714) ×5.598793055.

= 3*5.598793055 +0.5*5.598793055 +0.0714285714285714*5.598793055.

Compute each term:

3 *5.598793055 = 16.796379165.

0.5 *5.598793055 = 2.7993965275.

0.0714285714285714 ×5.598793055.

Compute 0.0714285714285714 ×5 =0.357142857142857.

0.0714285714285714 ×0.598793055≈0.04285714285714285 ×0.598793055 ≈0.02566666666666667.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.0714285714285714 ×5.598793055.

= (1/14) ×5.598793055.

Wait, 1/14 is approximately 0.0714285714.

So 5.598793055 ÷14 ≈0.3999138.

So 0.0714285714 *5.598793055≈0.3999138.

So the third term is approximately 0.3999138.

Adding all three terms: 16.796379165 +2.7993965275=19.59577569 +0.3999138≈19.9956895 GeV.

So about 19.9957 GeV. Rounding to four decimal places, that's 20.0000 GeV.

But the options don't have 20 GeV. So perhaps the question expects the answer to be 20.132 GeV, but I'm not seeing why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the nucleus's mass. Let me think again: Li-6 is a nucleus with 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass is approximately 6.012 u, but perhaps the exact value is higher. Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value from a table.

I recall that the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01055301 u. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but the question states the energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon. So that's not it.

Another thought: perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the calculation requires the gamma factor for such a speed. Alternatively, perhaps using beta =v/c =0.96, but using a more precise calculation of gamma.

Wait, let's compute gamma using more precise calculation of beta and beta squared.

beta =0.96.

beta squared =0.96^2=0.9216.

1-beta squared=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is still 3.5714285714285714.

Hmm, I'm not finding any error in the calculation steps. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

The closest to my calculation is option C:20.132 GeV.

But why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is considered to have a mass of 7 u (Li-7?), but the problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy, which would be gamma * m c². So I think that's what I've been calculating.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me compute gamma with more precise beta.

Wait, beta =0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, gamma=1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

But 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=3.57142857.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as 6 u, leading to E=3.57142857 *6 *931.494 MeV.

Which would be 3.57142857 *5588.962 MeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5588.962.

3 *5588.962=16766.886 MeV.

0.57142857 *5588.962.

0.5 *5588.962=2794.481 MeV.

0.07142857 *5588.962 ≈400.000 MeV.

So 0.57142857 *5588.962≈2794.481 +400=3194.481 MeV.

Total E=16766.886 +3194.481=19961.367 MeV=19.961367 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.96 GeV.

Again, this is not matching option C.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but my calculations don't lead there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in terms of the atomic mass including electrons, but I'm not sure. So perhaps the nucleus's mass is considered as 6.012 u (including electrons), leading to a higher m c².

So m c²=6.012 u *931.494 MeV/u=6.012 *931.494 ≈5600.326 MeV=5.600326 GeV.

E=gamma *m c²=3.57142857 *5.600326 ≈?

3.57142857 ×5.600326.

3 *5.600326=16.800978.

0.57142857 ×5.600326 ≈3.199319.

So E=16.800978 +3.199319≈19.999997≈20.0000 GeV.

Still, no match with option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c or another unit conversion. Hmm, perhaps I should check the unit conversions.

Wait, 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c².

So m c² for 6 u is 6 *931.494 MeV=5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.588964≈19.96 GeV.

Again, this doesn't match any options except perhaps C, but it's close.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is C:20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not 0.96c, but another value. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The question says: speed is 0.96c. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the energy is approximately 20 GeV, which is closest to option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, looking at the options again, option C is 20.132, which is higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of gamma?

Wait, perhaps when I compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), I should be more precise with beta.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta^2 is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 =0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the kinetic energy as the total energy. No, that doesn't make sense, because the kinetic energy is part of the total.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the nuclear mass as 6.012 u and not subtracting the electrons. So m c²=6.012 *931.494=5600.14 MeV=5.60014 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.60014=?

3.57142857 ×5.60014.

3 *5.60014=16.80042.

0.57142857 ×5.60014.

0.5 *5.60014=2.80007.

0.07142857 ×5.60014≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 ×5.60014≈2.80007 +0.400=3.20007.

So E=16.80042 +3.20007=20.00049 GeV.

So approximately 20.0005 GeV, which is about 20.0005 GeV.

But none of the options match exactly, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is using a different value for u. Let me check: 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c². But perhaps the exact value is 931.5 MeV/c².

Using 931.5 MeV/u:

m c² for 6.01055301 u is 6.01055301 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01055301 *931.5=9.833 MeV (approx).

So total m c²=5589 +9.833=5598.833 MeV=5.598833 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.598833.

3.57142857 *5.598833.

3 *5.598833=16.796499.

0.57142857 *5.598833.

0.5 *5.598833=2.7994165.

0.07142857 *5.598833≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 *5.598833≈2.7994165 +0.400=3.1994165.

Total E=16.796499 +3.1994165≈20.00 GeV.

Again, no match for option C.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I can't see any calculation mistake in my steps. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different formula, like non-relativistic, but that wouldn't make sense for v=0.96c.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy of each nucleus, and perhaps the collider uses two beams, but the question doesn't specify. But the question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which I think refers to the energy per beam.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic work-energy theorem, which states that the kinetic energy is the integral of force over distance, but that's more complicated and probably not needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula E = gamma m c squared, but with m as the rest mass of the nucleus, which I've correctly calculated as approximately 5.5988 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 ×5.5988 ≈19.996 GeV.

But perhaps the question expects the answer rounded to four decimal places, which would be 20.0000 GeV. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of gamma.

Wait, maybe using more precise calculation of gamma:

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the rest mass as exactly 6 u, leading to E=3.57142857 *6 *931.494 MeV.

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.588964=?

Let me compute this precisely:

3.57142857 ×5.588964.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 25/7.

So 25/7 *5.588964= (25 *5.588964)/7.

25 *5.588964 =139.7241.

139.7241 /7 =19.9605857 GeV.

So approximately 19.9606 GeV.

But again, this doesn't match any options except perhaps none.

Wait, looking at option D:21.419 GeV. How would that happen? Let me see what gamma would be to reach that.

If E=21.419 GeV and m c²=5.5988 GeV, then gamma=E/(m c²)=21.419 /5.5988 ≈3.816.

So gamma would be about 3.816, which corresponds to beta= sqrt(1 -1/gamma²)=sqrt(1 -1/(3.816)^2)=sqrt(1 -1/14.56)≈sqrt(0.9344)=0.9668. Which is higher than 0.96, so that's not the case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as 7 u (Li-7), but the problem says 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C:20.132 GeV. However, I don't see how that number arises from the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise beta.

Wait, beta =0.96.

Compute gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator for gamma.

I could compute gamma as 3.57142857, which is 25/7.

Now, let me compute E=gamma*m c².

m c² is 5.598793 GeV.

3.57142857 ×5.598793.

Let me compute this using exact multiplication.

3.57142857 ×5.598793.

Compute 3 ×5.598793=16.796379.

0.57142857 ×5.598793.

Compute 0.5 ×5.598793=2.7993965.

0.07142857 ×5.598793.

Compute 5.598793 ×0.07=0.39191551.

5.598793 ×0.00142857= approximately 0.0079999.

So 0.07142857 ×5.598793≈0.39191551 +0.0079999≈0.400.

So 0.57142857 ×5.598793≈2.7993965 +0.400≈3.1993965.

So E=16.796379 +3.1993965≈19.9957755 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.9958 GeV, or 20.00 GeV when rounded.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but that's 0.132 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as 6.012 u, leading to m c²=5.60014 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 ×5.60014=?

3.57142857 ×5.60014.

3 *5.60014=16.80042.

0.57142857 ×5.60014≈3.19931.

So E=16.80042 +3.19931≈19.99973 GeV ≈20.00 GeV.

Still, no match.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the correct answer should be approximately 20 GeV, but since option C is the closest, I'll go with that.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has a rest mass of approximately \( 6.01055301 \, \text{u} \). Using the conversion \( 1 \, \text{u} \approx 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.01055301 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 5.5988 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 \approx 5.5988 \, \text{GeV} \) into the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.5988 \approx 19.9958 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This rounds to approximately \( 20.00 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy \( \approx 20.00 \, \text{GeV} \) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. While the exact calculation yields \( \approx 19.9958 \, \text{GeV} \), the slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
