Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). They're asking for the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation value of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation value. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Let's start with ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in the given state.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. The P_z matrix is given as:

Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ ]

Wait, no, wait. The way it's written, the matrix for P_z is diagonal: first element ħ, second 0, third -ħ. Because eigenvectors of P_z are the basis vectors here. So the operator P_z is diagonal in this basis.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can multiply the state vector by P_z and then take the inner product.

Wait, no. Alternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of |ψ> corresponds directly to the eigenvalues. Wait, hold on. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors
