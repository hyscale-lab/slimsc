Okay, so I'm looking at this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is what the question states.

The problem says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I need to figure out how the excitation relates to the temperature of the stars.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann factor describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels, which is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Since the problem states that star_1 has twice the excitation, I think that means the population ratio n1/n2 is 2, where n1 is the higher excited state in star_1 and n2 is the same state in star_2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. So, if the iron atoms are in a higher energy level, the excited state, then the ratio of their populations is determined by the Boltzmann equation. Let me define the excited state as level 2 and the lower as level 1. So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). But wait, in this case, the excitation level is higher in star_1. So for each star, the ratio of the excited to lower state would be (g2/g1)*exp(-ΔE/(k T)), assuming g2 and g1 are the degeneracies for each level.

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe for each star, the ratio of excited to non-excited (ground state) is given. So let's say that for star_1, the ratio n_ex1 / n_ground1 = 2 times the ratio in star_2, which would be n_ex2 / n_ground2. Or wait, maybe the problem is that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So the excitation level (n_upper / n_lower) is 2 times higher in star_1 than in star_2.

Wait, no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, perhaps it's the population in the excited state that's twice as much. So for star_1, n_ex1 / n_total1 = 2 * (n_ex2 / n_total2), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the ratio n_ex/n_ground is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio between two energy levels. So, for each star, the ratio n_upper / n_lower equals (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Since the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2)

Assuming the degeneracies g are the same for both stars, which I think they are because the energy levels are the same; so g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, so the ratio would be proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So, let me write that:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1) / (n_upper2 / n_lower2) ) = 2

Which implies (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) = 2

Because n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)) multiplied by g_upper/g_lower (which cancels out when taking the ratio).

So:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me rearrange the terms. Let me factor that:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Or, ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

That's because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but the question gives the equation in terms of T1 and T2, so let's solve for the equation.

Wait, but the options are given as ln(2) equals something. So my equation is:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, let's compute [ΔE/(k)].

Given that ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wow, that's convenient. So substituting:

ln(2) = 1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, let's rewrite that denominator. T1 T2 is the product, and the numerator is T1 - T2. So the equation is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). So that's another way to write it.

Looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches what I have. So option D is correct.

Wait, let me make sure. The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2 / T1. No, doesn't match.

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2). No.

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2. No, because denominator is squared.

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels, which is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the degeneracies of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Assuming the degeneracies are the same for both stars, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: Does not account for the correct relationship between \(T_1\) and \(T_2\).
- **Option B**: Incorrectly adds \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the numerator.
- **Option C**: Incorrectly squares the denominator, which is not consistent with the derived equation.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
