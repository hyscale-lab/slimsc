Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. Wait, but it's relativistic, so I can't just use the classical equations. Oh right, relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, c.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is maximum when the potential is zero, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = sqrt(k/m) * A. That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so option C can't be the answer here.

In relativity, energy is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. The total energy E is gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is E - m c². So, in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential. When it passes through equilibrium (x=0), all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but wait, the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is the same as the classical case? Or does it change? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. In the classical scenario, the potential is (1/2)k x². But in relativity, perhaps the energy expressions are different because of the relativistic gamma.

Let me think. At the maximum amplitude A, the oscillator's velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards equilibrium, potential energy is converted to kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. It's (gamma - 1) m c².

So, the total energy E is conserved. At x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = potential energy. Potential energy here is (1/2)k A², I think. So, E = (1/2)k A² = gamma m c², but wait, no. Wait, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = m c² + (1/2)k A². Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. The potential energy is (1/
