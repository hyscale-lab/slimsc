Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and is often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially for aromatic compounds.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, right, that's a notation I'm a bit fuzzy on. Wait, I think when it's 2-d, the 'd' stands for 'deutero', which means a deuterium atom is present. Oh, right! So the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2. Wait, or is it the other way around? No, wait, the numbering: 1-bromo would be at position 1, and the 2nd position has a deuterium.

Wait, but wait, when I think about the structure, benzene is a ring with six carbons. So 1-bromo would be on the first carbon, and 2-d means that the second carbon has a deuterium attached. Or wait, maybe the 'd' refers to something else? No, I think 'deutero' is correct here
