Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the reactions given. So, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Another reaction is C with water, which reforms A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Alright, let's try to identify what these substances might be. The first clue is the bright red product C. I remember that some compounds are bright red. For example, I think of sulfur trioxide (SO3) but wait, that's a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's something like vanadium(V) oxide? No, V2O5 is orange. Hmm, or maybe it's a transition metal complex. Oh wait, another thought: the reaction of a solid with a gas to give a red product. Oh! What about the reaction of sodium (a solid) with chlorine gas (Cl2) producing sodium chloride. Wait, that's white, not red. Or, maybe the reaction is of magnesium with something? No, magnesium burns with a bright light but the product is white.

Wait, let me think of another angle. The product C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. Where F is a strong acid and G a weak one. Hmm, strong acids include H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak acids are like CH3COOH, H3PO4, etc.

Wait, suppose A is a metal, B is a halogen. So, for example, A could be Na (solid), B is Cl2. A + 8 B → C. Wait, 8 equivalents. Let me think about the possible reaction. Sodium (Na) and Cl2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form NaCl. But the product C would be NaCl, which is a solid, but wait, maybe another reaction.

Wait, maybe A is something else. Let me think about the reactions again. C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E. Oh, and D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include something like water, but B is a gas. So if B is Cl2, then D could be something else. Alternatively, maybe B is O2, and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, a solvent.

Wait, let's try to piece this together. Let's consider possible reactions.

If A is a metal, like Na, and B is Cl2. Then, A + B → C. But 8 equivalents of B? Oh, wait, perhaps it's a different reaction. Another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is CuO (solid), and B is H2 (gas). Then, reaction would be: CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But that doesn't fit with the product being red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. Maybe, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the product C reacting with water. So C + H2O → A + F + G
