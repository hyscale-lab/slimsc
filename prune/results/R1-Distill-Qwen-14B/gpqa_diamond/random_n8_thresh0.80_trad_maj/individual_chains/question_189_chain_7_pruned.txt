Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which effective particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

Wait, spontaneous symmetry breaking... Right, that's when the system's symmetry is broken, but the laws themselves are still symmetric. The particles that arise from this are called Nambu-Goldstone bosons, I think. They're massless in the symmetry-preserving case but can become massive when symmetry breaks.

Phonon: From what I remember, phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. They arise from the quantization of elastic vibrations. Now, when a crystal has a broken translational symmetry (like a solid versus a liquid), phonons are the associated quasiparticles. So phonons are linked to broken symmetry. But wait, don't phonons also come from the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry? I'm a bit confused. Or maybe it's the opposite—phonons are due to the unbroken symmetry, like the atomic lattice having a periodic structure, which is a broken translational symmetry. Hmm, I think phonons are Nambu-Goldstone bosons in that case. So they are associated with a broken symmetry.

Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain magnetic materials. They arise from the breaking of rotational symmetry, if I'm not mistaken. Like in the context of pion physics or in some condensed matter systems, Skyrmions are stable due to the topological charge. So they must be tied to a broken symmetry, probably the chiral symmetry in QCD or something like that.

Magnon: Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in a magnetically ordered system. They arise from the collective excitation of spins. When a magnet has a broken rotational symmetry (like in a ferromagnet), the magnon would be the Goldstone boson. So yes, magnons are linked to broken symmetry.

Pion: Pions are the lightest mesons, and I remember that in the context of chiral symmetry breaking. In QCD, the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the pions are the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. But wait, because the pions are actually pseudo-Goldstone bosons since the symmetry is only approximate, but they are still associated with the broken symmetry.

So the question is which one is NOT associated with a broken symmetry. Wait, all the options are, except one. Let me think again.

Wait, phonons. Phonons are massless? No, in the case of broken symmetry, the Goldstone bosons are massless. But phonons in a solid are massive (they have a dispersion relation like sound waves). But wait, I've heard that phonons can still be considered as Goldstone bosons when the underlying crystal has a broken translational symmetry. Because the lattice breaks the translation symmetry, so the phonon is a Goldstone boson of that broken symmetry.

So all the options except one are Goldstone-like. Wait, but wait, let me think about each:

Phonon: broken translational symmetry → yes, so Goldstone boson.

Skyrmion: topological, but it's a result of broken symmetry.
