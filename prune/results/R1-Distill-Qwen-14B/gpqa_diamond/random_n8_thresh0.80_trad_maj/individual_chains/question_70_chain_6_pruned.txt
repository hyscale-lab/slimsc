Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are various point groups: C2, D4h, Dâˆžh, and C2v.

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are determined based on the arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The common point groups include things like D4h, which is a high symmetry group. Let me think about the reactions and try to figure out what each compound could be.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Bright red products often make me think of something like sulfur or perhaps transition metal compounds. Wait, copper sulfate is blue, but maybe something else. Oh, wait, when metals like iron or copper form certain compounds, they can have colored products. Alternatively, maybe this is a reaction involving nitric oxide or something, but I'm not sure yet.

Another thought: 8 equivalents of gas B. So, perhaps B is a diatomic gas. Let me think about what uses 8 equivalents. For example, if B is O2, but then 8 moles would be a lot. Alternatively, maybe B is a halogen, like Cl2 or Br2. But how would that fit?

Wait, another angle. Let's look at the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E being hazardous... possible things are like HCl gas? No, maybe something like phosgene, but that's more of a D reaction. Alternatively, maybe E is something like ozone, but that's a gas, but the problem says product E. Hmm.

Wait, the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. Oh, so C is likely a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. Strong and weak. So, for example, if C is a nitrate salt. Wait, but nitrate is usually a strong acid's conjugate base. Wait, when a salt of a strong acid and weak acid is hydrolyzed, it would produce the strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, no, because when a salt of a strong base and weak acid is hydrolyzed, it produces the weak acid. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, if C is a salt like sodium sulfite, which when hydrolyzed would produce a weak acid (sulfurous acid, H2SO3) and a strong acid (maybe H2SO4?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea. If C is a metal nitrate. For example, say A is a metal, B is O2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, if C is a nitrate salt, like copper nitrate. But when copper nitrate is hydrolyzed, it would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and perhaps another acid? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate hydrolyzes to produce HCO3^- and OH^-, but that's not two acids.

Wait, the salt when reacting with water gives two different acids. So, suppose C is a salt of a diacid. Like if the acid is diprotic but not tri
