Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. In this case, it's forming a complex with calcium. The stoichiometric complex probably means that each EDTA binds one Ca²+ ion, making a 1:1 complex. So the formula would be something like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA.

Wait, but what's the general approach here? I think it's about using the formation constant. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That probably means that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are such that they form the complex in a 1:1 ratio. So, initially, if all the Ca and EDTA are present as the complex, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, the solution is prepared by adding 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, which then dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So at equilibrium, the complex dissociates a bit, releasing some Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. So I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

So the formation constant Kf is given as 5e10, which is a large number, indicating that the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should
