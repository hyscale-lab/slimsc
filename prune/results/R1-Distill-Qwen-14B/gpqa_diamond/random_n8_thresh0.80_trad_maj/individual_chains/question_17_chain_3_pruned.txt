Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions when there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10.

Wait, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, Ca is complexed with EDTA. The complex is CaY^2-, I think, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. 

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Right, because the complex dissociates a bit, and we need to find [Ca^2+].

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. 

So the formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, some of the complex will dissociate. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that dissociate. So, [Ca^2+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. But wait, is that correct? Let me think. The reaction is: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. So yes, if the complex dissociates by x, then both Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are x concentration each.

But wait, wait. The initial concentrations before dissociation, the complex is 0.02 M, and the free ions are zero? No, wait, actually, the solution is made by dissolving the complex. So I think the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are both zero, and the complex is 0.02 M. Then, upon dissociation, the complex breaks into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, no, wait. Wait, the complex is already formed, so when you have a solution of the complex, it doesn't have free EDTA or Ca unless it dissociates. So, the initial concentrations are [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, [Ca^2+] = 0, [EDTA^4-] = 0. Then, when it dissociates, some of the complex breaks down. Let x be the amount that dissociates. So, [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But wait, if x is small compared to 0.02, which it probably is because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. So, 0.02 -
