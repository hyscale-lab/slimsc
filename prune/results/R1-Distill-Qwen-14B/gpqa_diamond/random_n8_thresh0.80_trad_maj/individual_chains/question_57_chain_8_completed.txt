Okay, so I've got this problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. Each partial wave contributes based on the phase shifts δ_l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

Wait, the formula I think is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l ) / ( (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) * ... Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, the imaginary part specifically. Let me think again.

I recall that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction) is given by the formula: 

Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * Σ ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Where k is the wave number. Oh right, because when θ is zero, the sum simplifies because the cosine terms might drop out or something. So the imaginary part is just the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by k/(2π).

Wait, but what about the phase shifts given? The problem says to ignore rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we include all the given ones. The phase shifts provided are δ0 =90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. So l goes from 0 to 4 in this case.

So I need to compute the sum for l=0 to 4: (2l+1) * sin(δ_l). Then multiply that sum by k/(2π).

But wait, what's k? The wave number k is given by k = √(2mE)/ħ. Or maybe I should use the Compton wavelength formula? Wait, the energy given is 50 MeV for the electrons. Let me think about the units.

Wait, electrons have a rest mass, m_e. The energy here is the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy? Wait, the problem says it's a 50 MeV electron. So I think that's the kinetic energy, but actually, wait, when you have high-energy electrons, sometimes people quote the kinetic energy or the total energy. Wait, 50 MeV is a lot for an electron. Let me see: the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is way higher, so relativistic effects are significant.

But wait, the wave number k for an electron can be approximated using the relation E = ħ²k²/(2m). But wait, that's non-relativistic. For high energies, the relation is E = ħck, where c is the speed of light. Because for relativistic particles, E ≈ pc, and since p = ħk, so E ≈ ħck. Thus, k = E/(ħc).

Wait, let's compute k. E is 50 MeV. Let's make sure about the units. 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. ħ is about 197.33 MeV·fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 meters). So ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So k = E/(ħc) = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the wave number is in inverse femtometers. Because ħc is in units of MeV·fm, so E is in MeV, so dividing gives 1/fm. So k here is approximately 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Now, let's compute each term in the sum. So for each l from 0 to 4:

l=0: (2*0 +1) * sin(δ0)
δ0 is 90 degrees, sin(90) is 1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. sin(67 degrees). Let me calculate sin(67°). I think it's about 0.9205. So 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. sin(55 degrees). Sin(55) is about 0.8192. 5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3: 2*3+1=7. sin(30)=0.5. So 7*0.5=3.5.

l=4: 2*4+1=9. sin(13 degrees). Sin(13) is approx 0.22495. 9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615

3.7615 +4.096 = 7.8575

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575

11.3575 + 2.02455 ≈13.382

So the sum S =13.382.

Now, Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * S.

Compute k/(2π): 0.253 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈0.253 /6.2832 ≈ approx 0.0403 fm^{-1}.

Multiply by S: 0.0403 *13.382 ≈ 0.539 fm. Wait, wait, that's about 0.539 fm. But the options are in the hundreds or thousands, like 177, 251, etc.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck. Oh! Wait a minute. I think I might have the formula wrong. I thought Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * sum[(2l+1) sin δ_l ]

But wait, wait, actually, another formula comes to mind. The real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) / ( ... )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to get the exact formula.

Wait, I found in my notes that the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of partial waves is:

f(θ) = Σ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) / (k (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) * ( (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) / (2i) ) 

Wait, maybe I should just focus on the formula for Im f(0). At θ=0, e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} becomes 0, but wait, let me think. Wait, no, wait, e^{i0} is 1, e^{-i0} is 1, so e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 0. So that would make f(θ) zero? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The optical theorem says that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is related to the total cross-section. But wait, the formula I'm thinking of is Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the factors. Let me check. I think the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) Σ ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

Wait, wait, let me think. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = Σ ( (2l+1) ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) / (2ik (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) ) * P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. 

But at θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1 for all l, since P_l(1) = 1 for any l (since it's the value at the pole). So f(0) becomes Σ ( (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik (1 - e^{2iδ_l})) )

Simplify the numerator and denominator: (e^{2iδ} -1) = -(1 - e^{2iδ}), so the whole thing becomes:

( (2l+1) * ( - (1 - e^{2iδ} )) ) / (2ik (1 - e^{2iδ})) ) ) = ( (2l+1) * (-1) ) / (2ik) )

So f(0) = Σ [ (2l+1) (-1) / (2ik) ) ] = - (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1).

Wait, that can't be right because the sum Σ (2l+1) would diverge as l increases. Oh wait, but we're only considering up to l=4 because higher phase shifts are ignored. So sum from l=0 to l=4.

Wait, but then f(0) is real? Because all terms are real here. But that's conflicting with the initial idea that the imaginary part is non-zero.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let's re-express f(0):

f(0) = Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik (1 - e^{2iδ_l})) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

(2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik (1 - e^{2iδ_l})) ) = (2l+1) (-1)(1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) / (2ik (1 - e^{2iδ_l})) ) 
= (2l+1) (-1) / (2ik )

So f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) (-1) / (2ik ) ) ] 

This would give f(0) as a real number because the numerator is real (2l+1 is real, -1 is real, denominator 2ik is imaginary). So f(0) would be a real number, but that can't be right because the scattering amplitude f has both real and imaginary parts.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: The partial wave expansion of f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * ( e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} ) / (2i) )

Which can be written as:

(1/(2i k)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) ( e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} )

At θ=0, e^{iθ} = 1, e^{-iθ}=1, so e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}=0. So f(0) would be zero? That can't be right either. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula for Im f(0) is (k/(4π)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l. I remember that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of f(0). The total cross-section σ_total is (4π/k²) Im f(0). So Im f(0) = (k²/(4π)) σ_total. But wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another source. Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im f(0) is (k/(2π)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l. Because in some references, I've seen that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by (k/(2π)) times the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let's proceed with that formula. So, Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So with the phase shifts given:

l=0: (2*0+1)*sin(90) = 1*1=1

l=1: 3*sin(67) ≈3 * 0.9205≈2.7615

l=2:5 * sin(55) ≈5 *0.8192≈4.096

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455

Sum these up:

1 + 2.7615 =3.7615

+4.096 →7.8575

+3.5 →11.3575

+2.02455 →13.38205

Sum is approximately 13.38205.

Now, k is 0.253 fm⁻¹ (earlier calculation).

So Im f(0) = (0.253 / (2 * π)) * 13.38205.

Compute 0.253 / (2 * 3.1416) = 0.253 /6.2832≈0.0403 fm⁻¹.

Multiply by 13.38205: 0.0403 *13.38205≈0.539 fm.

Wait, but the options are way bigger than that. The options are in the hundreds or thousands of fm. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recalculate k. The energy is 50 MeV. But for electrons, maybe I should use the relativistic expression. Because 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c² (0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are important.

The relativistic energy relation is E = gamma m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But for a free electron, E is the total energy. Alternatively, when dealing with high energies, the relation between energy and momentum is E = pc (since for ultra-relativistic particles, E ≈ pc). So p = E/(c). Then, the wave number k is given by k = p/ħ.

So let's compute k correctly. Let's compute it using E = pc. So p = E/c. Then, k = p/(ħ) = (E/c)/ħ.

E is 50 MeV. Converting to joules: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 50 MeV = 50e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-13 J.

c is 3e8 m/s. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = (50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV) / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) )

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 50e6 *1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J.

Denominator: 3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s ≈3.1637e-26 J·m.

So k = (8.01e-13 J) / (3.1637e-26 J·m) ) ≈ 2.53e13 m^{-1}.

Wait, but 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So 1 m^{-1} = 1e15 fm^{-1}.

So 2.53e13 m^{-1} = 2.53e13 * 1e15 fm^{-1} = 2.53e28 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So E = 50 MeV. So k = E/(ħc) = 50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}. Which brings us back to the initial value of k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct. So Im f(0) is approximately 0.539 fm. But the options are in hundreds or thousands. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k/(2π)) multiplied by the sum, but wait, perhaps I missed a factor of ħ or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is involved.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude f is in units of fm (since it's a length). The cross-section is σ = |f|^2, but that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the differential cross-section. The differential cross-section is given by dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|². At θ=0, the imaginary part of f contributes to the cross-section.

Wait, but that doesn't directly help. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. I think the correct formula for Im f(0) is (k/(2π)) * Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l. So with k=0.253 fm^{-1}, the sum is 13.382.

So Im f(0) = (0.253 / (2 * 3.1416)) *13.382 ≈ (0.0403) *13.382≈ 0.539 fm.

But the options are all in the hundreds. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula is (1/(2k)) * Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Let me compute that: (1/(2k)) * 13.382.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.253) ≈1.976 fm.

Multiply by 13.382: 1.976 *13.382 ≈26.5 fm.

That's better, but it's not matching any options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm. 26.5 isn't an option. So maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I had the wrong formula. Let me refer to some standard textbook formula.

Wait, from scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/(2i (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) )

At θ=0, e^{iθ}=1, so e^{iθ}-e^{-iθ}=0, which suggests f(0)=0. But that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps when l=0, the term for l=0 behaves differently.

Wait, perhaps I should expand in partial waves. For each l, the contribution to f(θ) is:

f_l(θ) = (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/(2i k (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) )

At θ=0, e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}=0, so each f_l(θ) is zero. But wait, that would make f(0)=0, which contradicts the idea that the imaginary part is non-zero. So perhaps I'm missing a term.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to recall that Im f(0) is given by:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, that's another possibility. So let me try that.

Using the same data:

(k/(4π)) *13.382.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}

So 0.253 / (4 *3.1416) ≈0.253/(12.566)=0.0201 fm^{-1}.

Multiply by 13.382: 0.0201 *13.382≈0.269 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should try calculating using the given formula and see which option is closest.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

With sum=13.382, and k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

(1/(2*0.253)) = 1/(0.506)≈1.976 fm.

1.976 *13.382 ≈26.5 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but none of the options are close to 26.5. What's the issue here?

Oh wait, maybe I'm using the wrong value for k. Let me think again. Maybe I forgot that electrons have charge and that target is a nucleus, but I think the calculation of k is correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy given is not the kinetic energy, but the total energy. So E = K + m c². But for 50 MeV electrons, K is much larger than m c² (0.511 MeV), so E ≈ 50 MeV.

But for precise calculation, let's compute E accurately. Kinetic energy K = 50 MeV. So E = K + m c² = 50 +0.511 =50.511 MeV.

But since 50 << 0.511 is not true, but 50 >>0.511, so for ultra-relativistic, E≈pc, so p=E/(c). So k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / ħ.

So let me compute E=50.511 MeV.

k = (50.511 MeV) / (ħ c) =50.511 /197.33 ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

Which is similar to previous value.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is different. Maybe it's (k/(2π)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So let me compute again:

sum =13.382.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

(0.253 / (2*3.1416)) *13.382 = (0.0403) *13.382≈0.539 fm.

Hmm, but options are way larger. So either the formula is wrong, or the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the cross-section. The total cross-section σ_total is (4π/k²) Im f(0). So Im f(0) = (k²/(4π)) σ_total.

But without knowing σ_total, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Born approximation. Hmm, but the question is about the exact calculation using the given phase shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula: Im f(θ=0) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Using that, as before:

1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.253) ≈1.976 fm.

sum is 13.382.

1.976 *13.382 ≈26.5 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute f(0) as a sum of all (2l+1) terms multiplied by their respective sin δ_l, and then multiply by k/(2π).

Wait, unless I'm making a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0: (1) * sin(90) =1*1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67) ≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5* sin(55)≈5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13) ≈9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205. So sum is correct.

Thus, perhaps the correct Im f(0) is approximately 0.539 fm. But this is not among the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm. Hmm, that's close to 26.5 *10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of 1/fm. Let me try again.

E =50 MeV.

ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = E / (ħc) =50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the sum times (k/2π) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of ħ? Let me think. The scattering amplitude f has units of length, so in terms of units, f is in fm.

But the other way: the sum is dimensionless, k is in fm^{-1}, so (k/2π) is in fm^{-1}, multiplied by a dimensionless sum gives a result in fm^{-1}.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the correct formula from the theory.

From scattering theory, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = Σ [ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l / (k (1 - e^{2iδ_l})) ) * (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/(2i) ) ]

So when θ=0, e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} =0, which suggests that f(0)=0. But this can't be right because the scattering amplitude at forward angles is typically large.

Wait, perhaps this formula applies for θ not equal to 0. Alternatively, perhaps for l=0, the term behaves differently.

Wait, for l=0, the denominator 1 - e^{2iδ_0} becomes 1 - e^{i180°} because δ0=90°, so e^{2iδ0} = e^{i pi} =-1.

So denominator is 1 - (-1) =2.

So for l=0, the term becomes (1) * e^{i pi} * sin(pi/2) / (k * 2) ) * (0/(2i)) → 0.

So all terms are zero. So f(0)=0? That can't be right. So perhaps my approach is flawed.

Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, multiplied by (1/(2k)).

Wait, let's compute that:

sum=13.382.

(1/(2k)) =1/(2*0.253)≈1.976 fm.

1.976 *13.382 ≈26.5 fm.

But the options don't have 26.5. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but the closest is option D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, 26.5 is about a tenth of 251.271. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10.

Wait, where could a factor of 10 come from? Maybe I made a mistake in units conversion. Let me check the calculation of k.

Wait, wait, ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So E=50 MeV, k = E/(ħc) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but if E is in GeV, then k would be different. Oh wait, the problem states 50 MeV, so E=50 MeV.

Wait, perhaps another approach: perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im f(0) = (1/0.253) *13.382 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Im f(0) as (k^2/(2)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

k=0.253, so k²≈0.064.

0.064 *13.382≈0.854 fm.

No, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (k) * something.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the scattering amplitude and the differential cross-section.

Another thought: perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but the given phase shifts are δ_l, not 2δ_l.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but that's a shot in the dark. Let's try it.

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3*sin(134)=3*sin(134). Since sin(180-46)=sin(46)=0.7193. So 3 *0.7193=2.158.

l=2:5*sin(110)=5*sin(70)=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9*sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.158 +4.6985=6.8565 +6.062=12.9185 +3.9456≈16.864.

Then, Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) *16.864.

k=0.253 / (2π) =0.0403.

0.0403 *16.864 ≈0.676 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should check if the options have any that are close to 0.539, but they're all way larger. So perhaps I did something wrong in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given phase shifts are for the optical theorem, and the sum is multiplied by a factor of (k / (4π)).

So Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So k=0.253, sum=13.382.

(0.253/(4*3.1416))= 0.253/12.566≈0.0201.

0.0201 *13.382≈0.269 fm.

Again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (k^2/(4π)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

k²=0.064.

0.064 *13.382≈0.854.

0.854/(4*3.1416)=0.854/12.566≈0.068.

Hmm, 0.068 fm. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum correctly. Let me recheck the sum.

l=0: 1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5*sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*sin(30)=3.5.

l=4:9*sin(13)=9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Summing: 1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.382.

So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives (1/(2*0.253)) *13.382 = (1.976) *13.382≈26.5 fm.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, 26.5 is about a sixth of that. No, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me think again.

Wait, ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So for E=50 MeV,

k= E/(ħc) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k/(2π)) multiplied by the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but for each term, I should calculate (2l+1) sin δ_l, sum them, then multiply by k/(2π). So let me compute that again.

Sum is 13.382.

k=0.253.

0.253 / (2 *3.1416)=0.0403.

0.0403 *13.382≈0.539 fm.

Hmm. I'm at a loss here. The correct calculation based on this seems to give 0.539 fm, which is not one of the options. But let's look at the options:

Option B is 355.351 fm.

Wait, 0.539 *660 ≈355. So 660 is approximately 2π * 100 (since 660≈ 2*3.14*100=628). So perhaps I missed a factor of 2π somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but that's what I did. 0.253/6.2832=0.0403 *13.382=0.539.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (k/(2)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So 0.253/2=0.1265.

0.1265 *13.382≈1.69 fm.

No, that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, not degrees? Oh! Oh my gosh, that's a possibility.

If the phase shifts are in radians, then I must convert them.

Wait, the question states the phase shifts as 90°, 67°, etc. So they're in degrees. But if someone mistakenly treats them as radians, that would change everything.

For example, δ0=90° = π/2 ≈1.5708 radians.

But let's imagine that someone treats them as radians. Then, the sines would be much smaller.

But that's unlikely, as the question states degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the formula uses δ_l in radians, but the given data is in degrees.

But that would be a mistake, but let's see.

If I convert each δ_l to radians and compute sin:

δ0=90°=pi/2→sin=1.

δ1=67°=1.169 radians →sin≈0.9135.

Wait, but no, the original calculation with degrees gave a sum of 13.382. If we compute using radians, the sum would be:

l=0: 1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(1.169)≈3*0.9135≈2.7405.

l=2:5 * sin(0.9599)=5*0.8153≈4.0765.

l=3:7 * sin(0.5236)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(0.2269)=9*0.2249≈2.024.

Sum=1 +2.7405=3.7405 +4.0765=7.817 +3.5=11.317 +2.024=13.341.

Not much different from before. So that wouldn't change things.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on the formula I'm using is around 0.539 fm, but that's not an option. Perhaps I'm using the wrong formula altogether.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) multiplied by (ħ c k)/(2 π).

Wait, because Im f(0) should have units of length (fm).

k is in fm^{-1}, so ħ c has units of MeV fm. Let me compute that.

(ħ c k ) = ( MeV fm ) * (fm^{-1}) )= MeV.

But then (ħ c k) * something would have to have units of fm.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is 177.675 fm. How?

Let me compute 13.382 multiplied by (k/(2π)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute k/(2π) as 0.253/(2 * 3.1416)=0.0403.

Then, 0.0403 *13.382=0.539.

But 0.539 is about 0.54, which isn't an option.

Wait, but if I take the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is 13.382, and multiply by (k/(2π)) * something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (k/(2π)) * something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute k again.

Wait, E=50 MeV.

Since E = ħ c k → k = E/(ħ c) =50 /197.33≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (k^2/(2)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

k^2=0.064.

0.064 *13.382≈0.854.

Which is still not matching.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the correct approach is to select option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, but why? Because 0.539 * 330≈178. So perhaps I missed a factor of 330 somewhere.

Wait, 330 is about 2π*53, but I don't see where that comes from.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recheck the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_o=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13.

Wait, perhaps I should include l=0 to l=4, which I did. So sum is correct.

I think I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is approximately 0.539 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is 0.539 multiplied by 330. But I'm not sure why that factor would be present.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (k/(2π)) * sum * 1000.

0.0403 *13.382 *1000=539 fm. Still not matching any option.

Wait, option A is 87163 fm, which is way too big.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (ħ c )/(2 π).

Because ħ c is about 197 MeV fm.

sum=13.382.

(197.33 MeV fm) / (2 *3.1416) ≈197.33/(6.283)≈31.38 MeV fm.

31.38 MeV fm *13.382≈420.3 MeV fm.

But the units don't make sense, as MeV fm is not a length unit.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make a guess. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

Wait, how? Let me compute 13.382 * (k/(2π)) * 100.

0.0403 *13.382=0.539, multiplied by 100 gives 53.9. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) * (k/(2π)) * 1000.

0.539 *1000=539, which is close to option A (87163) but no.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. The sum is about 13.382, k=0.253, so (0.253/(2pi))*13.382=0.539.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) multiplied by (1/k).

So 13.382 * (1/0.253)≈52.89 fm.

Which is close to option B) 355.351 fm. No, but 52.89 is not close to any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm. Let me compute 0.253 * 13.382=3.389. No, that's not it.

Wait, 251.271 divided by 13.382 is approximately 18.75.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and have to proceed with the formula as I have. Based on the calculations, the correct answer isn't present. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the formula is (k/(2π)) * sum, but the sum includes l=0 to l=4, which is correct. So I think the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I should select option D) 251.271 fm.

Wait, 251.271 divided by 13.382 is about 18.76. Which is approximately 6π (since π≈3.14, 6π≈18.84). So perhaps the formula is (k/(2π)) * sum *6π.

Which would be (0.253/(2π)) *13.382 *6π =0.253 * 13.382 *3 ≈0.253 *40.146≈10.17 fm. Still not matching.

Well, I'm running out of time. I'll have to make a guess. I think the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the incident beam direction (θ = 0), the formula used is:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{k}{2\pi} \sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) \sin \delta_l
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts and Sum Calculation**:  
   The given phase shifts are:
   - \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \)
   - \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \)
   - \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \)
   - \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \)
   - \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \)

   For each \( l \), the term \( (2l+1) \sin \delta_l \) is calculated:
   - \( l=0 \): \( (2(0)+1) \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
   - \( l=1 \): \( (2(1)+1) \sin(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615 \)
   - \( l=2 \): \( (2(2)+1) \sin(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096 \)
   - \( l=3 \): \( (2(3)+1) \sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5 \)
   - \( l=4 \): \( (2(4)+1) \sin(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455 \)

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 \approx 13.382
   \]

2. **Wave Number \( k \)**:  
   The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \):
   \[
   k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
   \]

3. **Imaginary Part of the Scattering Amplitude**:  
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im } f(0) = \frac{k}{2\pi} \cdot \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin \delta_l
   \]
   \[
   \text{Im } f(0) = \frac{0.253}{2\pi} \cdot 13.382 \approx \frac{0.253}{6.2832} \cdot 13.382 \approx 0.0403 \cdot 13.382 \approx 0.539 \, \text{fm}
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f(0) \approx 0.539 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 330 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the formula or an issue with the provided options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
