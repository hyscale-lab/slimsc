Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. I remember that any state can be written as a linear combination of these basis states.

First, I think I need to normalize this state. Because the question says it's "proportional to" that expression, so the actual state might have a normalization constant. Let me compute the norm of the given vector.

The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So for (1+i), the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So squared, that's 2. For (2 - i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5). Squared, that's 5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, let me compute that again. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes. So the magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The magnitude squared of (2 - i) is (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4+1=5. So 2 +5=7. Yep, normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Okay, next part: we're told to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the matrix like? Let's think about the basis. Since the state is in the spin-up and spin-down basis, which are |up> and |down>, the operator's matrix is 2x2.

So the matrix A would have 0 on the diagonal, and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal elements. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Wait, yes, because for i≠j, Aij is ħ/2. So rows and columns are in the order |up>, |down>.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact form. Let me be precise. The operator's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are ħ/2. So yes, the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Hmm. Now, this operator is presumably another observable. To find the possible outcomes when measuring this operator, I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenstates.

Wait, because the operator is a 2x2 matrix, I can compute its eigenvalues. Let me find them.

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, a]] (since our matrix is symmetric) would be a ± b. Wait, no, wait. The general case for a 2x2 symmetric matrix [[a, b],[b, c]] has eigenvalues [ (a + c)/2 ± sqrt( ((a-c)/2)^2 + b^2 ) ].

Wait, so for our matrix A, a=0, b=ħ/2, c=0. So the eigenvalues would be (0+0)/2 ± sqrt( ( (0-0)/2 )^2 + (ħ/2)^2 ). That simplifies to 0 ± sqrt( (ħ/2)^2 ) → which is ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, and the probabilities depend on the state |alpha> and the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to find the eigenstates of A and then compute the projections. Let me try that.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. To find its eigenstates, I can solve (A - λI)|v> = 0.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) is [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]]. So the equations are: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0; (ħ/2) v1 + (-ħ/2) v2=0.

These simplify to v1 = v2. So the eigenstate is proportional to [1, 1], so |eigen1> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the equations would be (A + (ħ/2) I) |v> =0 → [[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]].

Which gives (ħ/2)(v1 + v2) =0. So v1 = -v2. So the eigenstate is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = |eigen2>.

Wait, but the signs might vary, but the important thing is the orthonormality.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, wait! Let me make sure I got the signs right.

Wait, when I plug λ = ħ/2 into A, I get the matrix:

[0 - ħ/2, ħ/2]
[ ħ/2, 0 - ħ/2 ]

Wait, no, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the matrix for λ = ħ/2 is:

[0 - ħ/2 , ħ/2]
[ ħ/2, 0 - ħ/2 ]

Which is [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]].

The first equation is (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenstate is any vector where v1 = v2. So the normalized eigenstate is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix is:

[0 + ħ/2, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 + ħ/2 ]

Which gives equations (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenstate is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are (|up> ± |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the state |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of these eigenstates, and the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities of measuring their corresponding eigenvalues.

So let's express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

We have |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Let me write the eigenstates again:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, I can write:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->

So let's compute c_+ and c_-.

c_+ = < + | alpha > = [ < up | + < down | ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Compute this:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + <up| (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ) + (1/sqrt(2)) ( <down| (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + <down| (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down> ) ) ]

Wait, but inner products <up|down> = 0 and <down|up> =0. So many terms vanish.

So let's compute:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + 0 ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ 0 + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) ]/( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator: 1 +i +2 -i =3 → numerator is 3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) )= 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha > = [ <up| - <down| ]/sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Again, compute:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) (-1) <down|up> ] + (1/sqrt(2)) [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> (but <up|down> is zero) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) (-1) <down|down> ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

Because:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ] / sqrt(2)

So,

= [ (1 +i) - (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

= [1 +i -2 +i ] / ( sqrt(14) )

= [ (-1) + 2i ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, wait, let me compute the numerator again:

(1 +i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but the coefficient can be written as a complex number, but the probabilities are the square of the magnitude.

So the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

(3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|^2:

The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5). So (sqrt(5)/sqrt(14))² =5/14 ≈0.3571429.

Wait, but 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.3571429. But wait, 9 +5=14, so that's correct. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36 for the probabilities. Now, the average value would be the expectation value of the operator A.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value can also be calculated as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So expectation value = (probability of +) * (+ħ/2) + (probability of -) * (-ħ/2).

Which is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) ħ ]/(2 *14 )

= (4 ħ) / (28) = ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of c_+ and c_-.

Wait, earlier I thought |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all over sqrt(7). So when projecting onto |+>, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), the inner product is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7*2), right?

(1+i) + (2 -i) =3 → 3/(sqrt(14)).

So c_+ =3/sqrt(14), |c_+|^2=9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and5/14, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A's probabilities match.

The average value is (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] (ħ/2) = (4/14)(ħ/2) = (2/7)(ħ/2) ) = ħ/7. Which matches option A's average.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7 → so it's the correct answer.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5 \).

The total squared norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding orthonormal eigenstates are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
To find the probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), express \( |\alpha\rangle \) as a linear combination of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
c_+ = \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is the expectation value:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the eigenvalues and probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left( \frac{9}{14} \right) \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{5}{14} \right) \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
