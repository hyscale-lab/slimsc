Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. I remember that in particle physics, the pion is at rest when it decays, so that might simplify things. The pion is the Pi(+) here, and it's stationary. The products are a muon (mu(+)) and a neutrino (nu). 

First, I need to recall some basic concepts about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they are neutral and super light, but I think in this case, since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their energies would add up, but their momenta would cancel each other out.

Now, the problem gives the rest masses of the particles. The pion (Pi(+)) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon (mu(+)) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. I'm not sure about the neutrino's rest mass, but I think for the purpose of these problems, sometimes they assume the neutrino is massless. Or maybe it's negligible compared to the other masses. Hmm, I should check that. 

Wait, the neutrino's mass is considered very small, but in reality, it's not zero. However, in particle physics problems, especially when dealing with relativistic effects, sometimes they are approximated as massless. I'll proceed under that assumption unless stated otherwise.

So, the total energy in the system is the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The energy of the products must add up to this. So, the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But wait, energy isn't the only thing to consider. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the
