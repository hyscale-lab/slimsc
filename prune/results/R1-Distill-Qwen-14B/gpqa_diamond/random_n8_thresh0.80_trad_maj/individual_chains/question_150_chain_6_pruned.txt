Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But I'll take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it goes through a series of reactions, and I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I should probably figure out what the starting compound is based on the NMR data. Let's look at the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm: A triplet integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high ppm, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm, so that makes sense. A triplet suggests that this proton is coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's a coupling with two equivalent protons on adjacent carbons.

- 6.98 ppm: A doublet of 2H. That could be aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring because in a para substitution, the protons are equivalent and each would couple with one adjacent proton. So the doublet makes sense for para substitution.

- 6.51 ppm: Another doublet of 2H. Maybe another aromatic ring but in a different substitution pattern? Or maybe it's adjacent to the substituent. Wait, if the first peak is a doublet at 6.98, perhaps that's a ring with substituents that deshield the protons, like an electron-withdrawing group. The 6.51 could be another ring, perhaps with substituents that are electron-donating?

- 6.27 ppm: A broad singlet of 2H. Broad singlet could indicate some exchange with a proton that's near an electronegative atom, maybe an -OH group, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to another group, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, in some cases, the broad signals can be due to coupling or proximity to oxygen. Maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring where the protons are in a position that's more shielded?

- 3.66 ppm: A doublet of 2H. That's probably a CH2 group. The doublet suggests each of these protons is next to another CH2 group. Oh wait, wait. Or perhaps they're next to another set of protons. Like, maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, such as an OCH2 group. The shift around 3.6 ppm is typical for CH2O. So maybe it's an ether or an ester or something like that.

Putting this together, I'm thinking maybe the structure has a benzene ring, another aromatic group, and some aldehyde and CH2O parts.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C8H9NO: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=(10)/2=5.

Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be two benzene rings (each contributing 3 DoU, but wait, two rings would be 6 DoU) â€” wait, but 5 DoU. Hmm, maybe one benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1 DoU), and an aromatic ring and a carbonyl? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, let's recount. 5 DoU could be a benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and an additional double bond (1), and maybe something else. Or perhaps an aromatic ring and another ring or double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. Let me think about the NMR again.

The 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde. Then the 6.98 and 6.51 are probably two sets of aromatic protons. The 6.27 is a set of two protons. Maybe, perhaps, two aromatic rings each with substituents.

Looking at the molecular formula C8H9NO, if it's an aldehyde, then when the aldehyde is part of a butyraldehyde group or similar. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents like a phenyl group and some other substituents.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. The aldehyde proton (9.72) is a triplet. If it's adjacent to a CH2 group, the aldehyde would be at the end, like RCHO where R is CH2-something.

Wait, considering the triplet at 9.72, maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group, which has two protons. The triplet would come from coupling with two neighboring protons. So for example, if the structure is CH2-CHO, then the aldehyde proton would be next to the CH2, which has two protons. So the coupling would be with two protons, leading to a triplet.

So perhaps the structure has a CH2CHO group attached to some aromatic rings.

Looking at the NMR again, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. If that's a CH2 group attached to something else, maybe an oxygen, because 3.6 is typical for OCH2. So perhaps it's OCH2CHO, but wait, that would be a hemiacetal or something else? Or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an ethyl group attached to an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something with a benzaldehyde group and a substituent that
