Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part methodically.

First, let's parse the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40. 

Diluting a solution usually involves calculating the new concentration using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration (M1) is 0.05 M, and the volume (V1) is 0.02 L. The new volume (V2) is 0.04 L. Let me calculate the new concentration (M2).

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2
= (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04
Hmm, 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001. Divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate. But when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, each mole of NaOH will react with a mole of acetic acid to form acetate and water.

The next part is the titration. We're adding 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me think about the equivalence point first because that might be simpler. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. 

So first, I should find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001.

Since the reaction is 1:1 (acetic acid to NaOH), the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is also 0.001 moles. 

Now, the volume of NaOH required at equivalence can be calculated. Molarity (M) = moles / volume (L). So volume = moles / M. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M.

Volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, no, 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L or 10 mL. So to reach equivalence, 10 mL of NaOH is needed.

But for the equivalence point pH, what happens there? Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, the equivalence point will form a solution of sodium acetate (the salt of a weak acid and strong base), which is basic. The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at equivalence. The total volume at equivalence is the sum of the initial acetic acid solution and the NaOH added. So initial volume is 40 cm³ (from 20+20), and we add 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The moles of acetate ion are 0.001 (since all the acetic acid has reacted). So concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction for acetate is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Ka * Kb = Kw (at 25°C, Kw is 1e-14), Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that Kb is very small, which makes sense because the acetate is a weak base. So the hydrolysis reaction won't proceed much, but let's set up the expression.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][
