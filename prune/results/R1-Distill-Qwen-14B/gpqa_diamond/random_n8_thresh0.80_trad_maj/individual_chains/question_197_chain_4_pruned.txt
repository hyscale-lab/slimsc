Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about Compound X, which undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the product formed from this reaction. The options are A to D, so I'll have to analyze each possibility after determining what Compound X is.

First, I should look at the spectral data provided: the IR and the 1H NMR.

Starting with the IR data:
The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches, possibly indicating substitution patterns.

The 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But considering the 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, a carboxylic acid is more likely because alcohols usually don't have such high chemical shifts. Wait, but actually, in NMR, the -OH of a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, but sometimes can be around 10-12 ppm depending on exchange. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton elsewhere. Hmm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The protons on the aromatic ring split into two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So probably the ring has two substituents in the para positions.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a methylene or methine group adjacent to another group, maybe a CH next to an oxygen or something else. Or perhaps it's part of an isopropyl group or similar.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): These are two protons, possibly part of a CH2 group adjacent to something else, perhaps in a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for three protons. This is likely a methyl group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe something like a CH(CH3) group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three protons, which is typical for a methyl group at the end of a chain, like a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. Let's consider the aromatic part first.

The two doublets in the NMR suggest a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are in the para positions. What substituents would that be? Let's think about the IR. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. That could be a ketone, an ester, or a carboxylic acid. The presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm might support a carboxylic acid, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, maybe the peak at 10.5 is something else, like an enol tautomer or an acidic proton elsewhere.

Wait, looking back, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more in line with a carbonyl group. So if it's a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 is a bit high; carboxylic acids usually have lower carbonyl peaks. Wait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right. Wait, no, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000, which is present here. So the 3400-2500 is probably O-H. So maybe it's a carbox
