Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to distance, right? So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question asks about the number of stars per unit parallax range. I think this is about the distribution of stars with respect to their distances. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the same number of stars exist in a given volume, regardless of where you look in that volume.

Wait, but parallax isn't a volume; it's just a measure of distance. So maybe I should think about how many stars fall into a certain range of parallax. Like, how many stars have parallax between plx and plx + dplx. 

I remember that distance is related to parallax. The formula is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 over parallax (d = 1/plx). So as plx increases, the distance decreases. So stars with larger plx are closer, and smaller plx are farther away.

Now, since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say the number density is n. So the number of stars in a volume element would be n multiplied by that volume.

But wait, how does the volume relate to parallax? Parallax is a function of distance. Let me think in terms of spherical shells. Imagine shells of radius r, each with thickness dr. The volume of each shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in each shell is n * 4πr² dr.

But since plx is 1/r, dr in terms of plx is a bit tricky. Let me express everything in terms of plx. Let's let plx = p. So p = 1/r, which means r = 1/p. Then, dr = -1/(p²) dp. Wait, because as p increases, r decreases. But for the volume, I think I should take the absolute value, so dr = (1/p²) dp.

So the number of stars in a shell between p and p + dp would be n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, let me make sure. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/p, so that's 4π (1/p)^2 dr. And dr is (1/p²) dp, so the volume becomes 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars N in a shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So the number per unit dp is N/(dp) = 4π n (1/p^4). So that would mean the number density in terms of parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are about how it changes with plx. So the answer should be proportional to 1/(plx)^4, which would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check. Maybe the confusion is whether it's 1/(plx)^2 or 1/(plx)^4.

Wait, another approach. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr multiplied by the number density n. So N = n * 4π r² dr.

But since parallax p = 1/r, r = 1/p → dr = -1/p² dp. Substitute r and dr into N:

N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ).

But since we're considering a small dp, the negative just indicates the direction of change, but the magnitude is what we're after. So N = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit parallax (dp) is N/(dp) = 4π n / p^4. So the number per unit parallax range is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct option is A, which is ~1/(plx)^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( p = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( p \) is the parallax and \( r \) is the distance. Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius \( r \) and thickness \( dr \) is given by the product of the number density and the volume of the shell: 

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi r^2 \, dr.
\]

Expressing \( r \) in terms of \( p \) (\( r = \frac{1}{p} \)) and substituting \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (taking the absolute value for magnitude), the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
\text{Volume of shell} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \, dp = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars in a shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dp \)) is then:

\[
\frac{N}{dp} = \frac{4\pi n}{p^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
