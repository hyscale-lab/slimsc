Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different molecular formulas, all with varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens.

First, let's go through the information given.

FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically show a strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the presence of an ester functional group is confirmed.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break down each part:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, the substituents could lead to different environments for the aromatic protons. But wait, if it's para-substituted, each set of H's would be equivalent, giving two signals. If it's ortho or meta, maybe more signals? Hmm, but the question says two signals. So maybe para substitution, which would split the aromatic Hs into two sets of two each? Or perhaps there are substituents that cause more splitting but lead to two signals because of symmetry. Wait, di-substituted rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, para would have two sets of two H each. Ortho would have a different pattern, maybe more signals. Let me think... In a para-substituted benzene, the two H on each adjacent carbon to substituents would be equivalent. Wait, no. Para substitution would have two substituents opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets, each with two equivalent Hs. So two signals, each a doublet perhaps, or maybe just singlets if deshielded in a certain way. So that fits with the NMR data.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to sp² hybridized carbons, like in alkenes. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, what does that mean? A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Doublet of quartets—might be more complex. Maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester, like an ethyl ester? Wait, no, esters typically have an OCOOR group. The ethyl group in an ester would have protons on the CH2 and CH3. But the NMR here is showing vinyl-H, which are part of a double bond. So perhaps there's an aromatic ring with an ester substituent that's part of a vinyl group, like maybe a styrene-type structure attached to an ester. Or perhaps a substituent that's an ester with a double bond nearby.

Wait, let me think: the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet (maybe two protons coupled to one neighbor each), and the other is a doublet of quartets. That might suggest some coupling with more protons. Like, if a vinyl proton is adjacent to two sets of neighboring protons. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group. For example, something like an ester with a double bond adjacent, like an allyl ester. Or maybe the substituent itself is a vinyl ester, like an acrylate group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like -O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's an ether and ester. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring and connected via an ester. For example, maybe the ring has a substituent like -CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2CH2-O-CO-something? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group that's part of a ring, such as in a cyclic ester. Hmm, not sure. Wait, no, the substituent is probably a side chain attached to the ring.
