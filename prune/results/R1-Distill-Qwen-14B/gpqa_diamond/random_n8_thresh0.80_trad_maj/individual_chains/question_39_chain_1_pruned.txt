Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region because that's where the particles aren't found. 

Wait, but the wave function given doesn't look like a standard form I remember. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. One of them is normalization. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. Also, the wave function must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of the square of the absolute value must converge.

But wait, the wave function given is a bit strange. It has a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5i). So, the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually complex, but the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is ψ*ψ. So, the probability density is |ψ|^2.

But wait a second, in the region where the particle is found (x between 1 and 3), the wave function must not be zero. But outside, like x<1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero. So, the given wave function should only be non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, but the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, that's a fixed expression. So, perhaps the wave function is zero outside the region, but inside, it's this expression.

Wait, but the wave function as written isn't zero at x=1 or x=3. Let me check. At x=1, it's (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i. At x=3, it's (a/sqrt(4)) which is a/2, minus 0.5i. So, non-zero in between. But the problem states that outside x<1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero because particles aren't found there. So maybe the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere?

But the problem says "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So that part is where it exists, between 1 and 3. So elsewhere, it's zero.

But then, how do we find 'a'? The normalization condition requires the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 to be 1.

So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute |ψ(x)|².

The modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [(-0.5)]^2, because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So, it's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, no, wait. Because when you have a complex number like A + Bi, the modulus squared is A² + B², right? So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that makes the integrand (a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25. Integrate that from 1 to 3.

But wait, the integral would be the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx. So, the integral equals 1, because the total probability is 1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, integrate a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln
