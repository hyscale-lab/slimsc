Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm trying to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that these abundance ratios are often given in terms of logarithms, like [X/Y], which represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let's think this through.

First, the problem states some data. Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Oh wait, [Si/Fe] is the logarithm of (n_Si / n_Fe) in Star_1 compared to the Sun. So if that's 0.3, it means that the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, which would mean that magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times the solar ratio.

Wait, but wait. The problem also gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh right, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe / n_H) relative to the Sun. So if it's zero, that means the iron abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Same with [Mg/H]_2 being zero: magnesium in Star_2 is at solar levels.

Now, the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5. Let me compute that. So subtract 12, so log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Then 10^(-4.5) is n_Fe/n_H for the Sun. Similarly, log10(n_Mg/n_H) is 7.5 -12 = -5, since 12 + log(n_Mg/n_H) =7, so log(n_Mg/n_H)=7-12=-5. So n_Mg/n_H = 10^-5.

Wait, wait, let me get that right. For the Sun, 12 + log(n_Fe/nH) =7.5 → log(n_Fe/nH)= -4.5 → n_Fe
