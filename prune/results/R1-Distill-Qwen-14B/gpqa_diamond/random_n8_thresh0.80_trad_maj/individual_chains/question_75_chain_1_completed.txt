Okay, so I've got this question in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a transgenic mouse model where someone is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They added a HA tag at the N-terminus, which is a common way to track proteins, right? But their experiment didn't work as expected—the protein isn't overexpressed. They did some tests and looked at the construct's plus strand sequence.

So the problem is that they couldn't overexpress the protein. Let me think about what could go wrong. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each possible issue.

Looking at the construct sequence, what's important when designing a transgene? Oh, right, the start and stop codons, reading frame, and any regulatory elements. Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct starts with the HA sequence followed by GADD45G. The sequence provided is the coding sequence, right?

Wait, let me check the sequence. The first part is ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. But HA is an antigenic determinant. The HA tag is usually something like YPYDVPDYA, which is about 11 amino acids. So the DNA for HA would be the corresponding codons. But in the given construct, the first codon after ATG is TAC (TYR), so that's the beginning of the HA tag? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't expressed. So why wouldn't it be expressed? Let's think about the options.

Option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. A missense would change an amino acid. If the HA tag is messed up, but the rest of the protein is okay, maybe the protein would still be expressed but not recognized by antibodies. But the question is about overexpression, so maybe the HA tag isn't the issue for expression levels. Unless the mutation in HA affects the reading frame, but that's a frameshift, and the question says it's a missense, so same reading frame.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. So if there's a stop codon (TAG, TGA, TAA) somewhere in the sequence, the ribosome would stop early, making a truncated protein. Let's look for stop codons. The sequence is in the plus strand, so the coding is 5' to 3'. So in the mRNA, it's the same except T becomes U. So any TAA in the DNA would be UAA in mRNA, which is a stop.

Looking through the sequence, I see a lot of codons. Let me scan for TAA or TAG or TGA.

Wait, looking through the DNA sequence for any TAA triplets. Let me see, going through the sequence:

Looking for TAA in the DNA. Since the DNA is the coding strand, the mRNA would have UAA as stop. So in the DNA coding strand, a TAA would correspond to UAA in mRNA, which is a stop.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start. Then TAC, etc. Let's look further down.

Hmm, let's scan for any TAA or TAG or TGA in the DNA sequence.

Looking through the given sequence:

...

Wait, at the end, I see ... GAGTGA. Let me count: GAG is Glu, then TGA is a stop codon in DNA? Wait, no. Wait, in the DNA, TGA is a stop codon in the mRNA (since in mRNA, it's UGA). So looking for TGA in the DNA.

In the DNA, the coding strand is the one that's the same as mRNA except T for U. So in the DNA coding strand, TGA would be a stop codon when transcribed.

Looking through the DNA, looking for TGA anywhere. Let's see.

Looking at the end: ...GCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, let me scan each triplet. Let's see:

Looking for TGA in the DNA.

Looking at the sequence:

- ...GGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, towards the end, I see 'TGAGTGA'—so that's TGAGTGA. Wait, the last part is 'GAGTGA'. So that would be GAG (Glu) then TGA. So in the DNA, the triplet TGA is present.

Wait, the last few codons are GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon in the mRNA.

So the construct has a TGA in the middle, which would cause a premature stop. So the ribosome would terminate early, making a truncated protein. So the correct answer would be option B: the ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The construct is the coding sequence. So the DNA is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So in the coding DNA, TGA is a stop. So in the given sequence, there's a TGA in the middle, which is a stop codon.

So the ribosome would read the mRNA, get to TGA, and stop. So the protein wouldn't be full-length. That would explain why it's not overexpressed, as the protein is not made correctly.

So the issue is an in-frame stop codon in the construct, causing early termination. That's option B.

Other options: Option C is about a linker causing proteolysis. But that would mean the protein is made but broken down. The problem is that they couldn't overexpress, so maybe the construct isn't making the protein at all. If it's broken down, you might still see some protein but lower levels, but perhaps it's more about the expression level.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But the tRNA doesn't recognize stop codons because termination is handled by release factors. So the presence of a stop codon would terminate translation regardless. So option D doesn't make much sense.

Option A: If the HA tag has a missense mutation, that might affect the tag's function but not the expression levels of the protein itself. The construct would still be expressed, but the HA tag might not be recognized. But the question is about overexpression, so if the gene is expressed, even with a bad HA tag, the protein levels should be high. Unless the mutation causes a frameshift, but the question says it's a missense, so same reading frame.

So the main issue is the premature stop codon in the construct, which is option B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model fails to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal HA tag. The provided DNA sequence of the coding strand was analyzed to determine the cause of the issue.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter an amino acid but would not necessarily prevent the expression of the protein. The protein could still be expressed, even if the HA tag is not functional. This does not explain the lack of overexpression, so this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   The DNA sequence was scanned for stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the coding strand. A stop codon (TGA) was found in the middle of the sequence, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. This would result in a truncated, non-functional protein, explaining the lack of overexpression. This is a strong candidate for the cause of the problem.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   Proteolysis typically occurs after the protein is synthesized, leading to degradation of the protein. However, the issue here is the complete lack of overexpression, which suggests the protein is not being synthesized at all. This makes proteolysis an unlikely explanation.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   Stop codons (UAA, UGA, UAG) are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Therefore, the absence of a tRNA for UAA is irrelevant to the termination of translation. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the DNA sequence explains why the ribosome terminates translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. This aligns with the observation of failed overexpression.

Answer: B
