Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement, like a mass on a spring. But wait, this one's relativistic, so I probably can't ignore relativistic effects.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by recalling some physics concepts.

In the classical case (non-relativistic), the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude. So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv²_max, which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic problem, so option C might not be the correct answer.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I can't use the classical equations. Instead, I should consider the relativistic expressions for energy.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is momentum. But for a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but maybe in this problem, we're treating it classically. So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, no—relativistic kinetic energy is different. Oh, right, the total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic.

Wait, but in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero and all the energy is kinetic. So perhaps I need to find the total energy and then relate it to the speed.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But how does potential energy factor in? Or is the potential energy treated differently?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the oscillator is given by the relativistic expression, where the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but
