Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when electrons scatter off a nucleus, the scattering amplitude is related to these phase shifts they're talking about. 

The question gives me five phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And it says to ignore the rest, so I guess I don't have to consider higher-order phase shifts beyond δ₄. 

I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum involving these phase shifts. 

I think the general formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (a_l (2l+1) * P_l(cosθ) ), where a_l is related to the phase shifts. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, when θ is zero, the incident and scattered beams are in the same direction. 

Wait, P_l(cosθ) is the Legendre polynomial. When θ=0, cosθ is 1. And P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. So the sum just becomes each term multiplied by (2l+1) and then scaled by 1/(2ik). 

But wait, what's a_l? Oh, right, a_l = (sin δ_l)/(k l (something?)) Wait, I think a_l is given by (e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the scattering amplitude can also be written as f = (1/k) Σ ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ) ) ) . 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term, and each term's amplitude is a combination of the phase shift for that l. 

The imaginary part of f(θ) along the beam direction, θ=0°, would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term in the series. 

So for each l, the term is (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) * P_l(
