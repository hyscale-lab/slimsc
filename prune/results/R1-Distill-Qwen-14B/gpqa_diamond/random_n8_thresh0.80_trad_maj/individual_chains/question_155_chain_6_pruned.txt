Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty of P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to find both ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state.

Wait, the state given is the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. So that's our ψ, right?

But wait, the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, because the matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So ψ is already expressed in the P_z basis, which means the expectation values can be calculated directly.

Wait, but ψ is in the eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So ψ is a superposition of the P_z eigenstates. But to find the expectation values, I can proceed as normal.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I'll take the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by P_z, then multiply by ψ. Same for ⟨P_z²⟩, but with P_z squared.

Let me write down the matrices and the vectors.

The P_z matrix is given as:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So P_z is diagonal, which makes things easier. The state ψ is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually column vectors, so ψ here is a column vector with those three elements. So ψ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, ψ† P_z is [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/sqrt(2))*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ] because when you multiply a row vector by a diagonal matrix, each element is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal entry.

Wait, no. Wait, ψ is a column vector. ψ† is a row vector with the conjugates. But in this
