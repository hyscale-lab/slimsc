Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and the dissociation of phosphoric acid. Hmm, let me think. The problem says we have a solution with 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, containing 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-.

Wait, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps. The first dissociates into H+ and H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second into H+ and HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third into H+ and PO4^3- (Ka3). The given Ka values are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

So, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out what these salts dissociate into. KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- right? And Na2HPO4·2H2O would give Na+ and HPO4^2- (I think the water doesn't affect the ions much here). So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so this is a buffer solution, right? Because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So this is a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. Oh, but in the solution, HPO4^2- might further dissociate to become PO4^3-, but considering the Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), that might be negligible. So perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is minimal compared to HPO4^2-.

So maybe I should calculate the contribution of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2- dissociation. But first, perhaps I should find the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

Let me calculate the moles of each salt.
