Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because Li normally has 4 neutrons in some isotopes, but here it's 3, so charge Z is 3 and mass number A is 6. So X is Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often what's given, but sometimes people talk about total energy, which includes rest mass energy. But wait, the problem says "energy of the RHIC". I think RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain kinetic energy. Or wait, maybe it's the total energy? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I'll have to think about what the formulas require.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So I should probably use the relativistic energy formulas. The total energy (E) of a particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (mc²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, I need to find gamma. Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - that is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy (mc²) for the Li-6 nucleus. Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait, the exact value? Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 u. I remember that the mass of a proton is around 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass is 3*(proton) +3*(neutron) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. Wait, but that's more than 6. Hmm, but wait, the actual mass is less because the binding energy makes the nucleus lighter. So I might need the exact value for Li-6.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation that the mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 u. Let me check. Oh, wait, the exact value is 6.014102 u. So I'll take that as 6.014102 u.

Now, I need to convert that to kilograms to find the rest mass energy. Because E = mc², and c is speed of light. But normally, people use units where 1 u is converted into joules. Alternatively, since energy in GeV is desired, perhaps I should find the energy in eV or GeV.

Wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, 1 u * c² = 931.5 MeV. So for Li-6, the rest energy is 6
