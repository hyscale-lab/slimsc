Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Hmm, let me read the question again. 

The problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu), right? The given rest masses are 139.6 MeV for the Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for the mu(+) particle. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies which I assume are for the mu and the neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos are leptons, and in particle physics, they are considered to have negligible mass. So in calculations involving neutrinos, we often treat their rest mass as zero. But wait, in this problem, since the muon has a rest mass and the pion's rest mass is given, I think the neutrino's rest mass can be ignored. Or is it not? Hmm, sometimes for problems, even if the neutrino has some mass, it's considered negligible, so perhaps we can proceed with that assumption.

So the decay is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me recall the energy and momentum conservation. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

So, for the muon, its total energy E_mu = gamma * m_mu * c². But wait, in particle physics, units are often in MeV, and c is taken as 1. So E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, where K_mu is the kinetic energy. Similarly, the neutrino's energy E_nu is just its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible, so E_nu = K_nu.

Wait, but neutrinos can have kinetic energy, and in terms of momentum, p = E / c for massless particles. Since we've set c=1, p = E. 

So, let's write the conservation equations. 

Energy conservation: m_pi = E_mu +
