Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the question and the reactions given.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a diamond-shaped molecule, which is pretty rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of those bridgehead carbons, specifically the 1 and 3 positions.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo elimination reactions, like E2, to form alkenes. Since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the elimination would likely form an alkene between the 1 and 3 positions. Wait, but in adamantane, the positions are arranged such that the 1 and 3 bridgeheads are on opposite sides. Elimination would form a double bond between them. So the product here would be 1,3-adamantadiene, I think. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid called product 1.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: there's a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an -O- group, like an ether or an alcohol. Wait, no, because KOH is a base. Oh wait, wait, when two bromides are eliminated with a base, perhaps it's not just elimination but maybe an epoxide formation? Or maybe it's a substitution reaction. Hmm, no, more likely elimination because KOH is a strong base and heat is applied, which favors elimination over substitution.

Wait, but the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak, which I think corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) group. So product 1 must have a ketone.

So, if I start with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and under KOH and heat, perhaps it's undergoing a substitution. Wait, but substitution with KOH would give a diol, but then the IR doesn't show O-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe elimination forms an alkene, but then where does the carbonyl come from?

Wait, maybe it's a vicarious nucleophilic substitution. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which might undergo some ring
