Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, the question is about finding the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values.

First, let me jot down the given data. The first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second one has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relative speed isn't just the difference, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities normally. I remember something about relativistic velocity addition.

So, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is u = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Let me plug in the values. Here, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, wait. Wait a second. Are we considering the relative speed from the perspective of the first astronaut (2m) or the second (3m)? Because relative velocity isn't symmetric. Oh, wait, the problem says "what will be the relative speed". I think in this context, it's the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other. So, I need to compute the speed of the 3m astronaut as seen from the 2m astronaut's frame, or vice versa?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at a relative speed. Let me compute that.

So using the formula u = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, actually, when you're calculating the relative velocity u of object 2 from the frame of object 1, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the signs mixed up. Let me think about the reference frames. So, the velocity of object 2 as seen from the rest frame of object 1 would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(
