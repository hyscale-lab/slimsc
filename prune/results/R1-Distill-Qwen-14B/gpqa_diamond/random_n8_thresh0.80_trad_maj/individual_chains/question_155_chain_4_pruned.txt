Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Wait, the matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are also given. Hmm. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is expressed in that basis.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula: ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩.

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which doesn't commute with P_z. So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ might not be zero. But wait, does the expectation value make sense? Or maybe not, because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, so when you measure P_x, you get a definite value, but P_z would have an uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, so the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ isn't necessarily zero.

So first, I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ in this state.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Let me write it down:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Because the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of ψ corresponds to the eigenvalues of P_z. So the first component is along the eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue ħ, the second is the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0 (since looking at P_z's matrix, the middle element is zero), and the third component is -ħ.

Wait, the P_z matrix is:

[ ħ    0    0
  0    0    0
  0    0   -ħ ]

Yes, so the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the basis states are |+z>, |0>, |-z> with those eigenvalues.

So the state ψ is a linear combination of these basis vectors: ψ = a|+z> + b|0> + c|−z> where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -
