Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to find out which one is correct.

Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually involves an acid reacting with a base to form water. I remember that the neutralization reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy change should be negative, which matches the options since they all are negative except maybe I should check. Let me see the options again: A is -2.72 kcal, B is -11.42 kcal, C is -3.80 kcal, D is -16.0 kJ. Oh, all options are negative except none, so that's consistent.

Wait, but all the options except D are in kcal, and D is in kJ. So the units might be a clue. I think enthalpy of neutralization is often given in kJ/mol, but sometimes in kcal/mol. I'll have to be careful with the units in the end.

First, I need to figure out the reaction that's taking place here. The acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2. So, the HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. When they mix, they'll neutralize each other.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two protons. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and it's a divalent metal hydroxide, so each Ba(OH)2 can provide two OH- ions. So the neutralization reaction would involve H+ ions from the acids reacting with OH- ions from the base.

Let me list out the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

First, for HCl: it's a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+.

Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL. So moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). 500 mL is 0.5 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL. 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH-.

The concentration is 0.5 M, volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So, when these solutions are mixed, the H+ and OH- will react:

H+ + OH- → H2O

The total H+ available is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, which one is the limiting reactant? The OH- is less, so it will run out first. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.2 moles of H+ will be consumed.

So, the neutralization will involve 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting to form water.

Wait, but wait a second. The H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. So the total H+ is 0.28, but OH- is 0.2. So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+.

That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted, which will be in the solution. But wait, no, because the H+ comes from two sources. Once the OH- is all used up, the excess H+ will determine the pH, but for the enthalpy of neutralization, we're only looking at the amount that actually reacts, which is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of reaction. For strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy per mole is about -57 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol, since 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal).

Wait, let me get the exact value. Wait, 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4184 J. 57 kJ is 57,000 J. Dividing by 4184 J/kcal gives approximately 13.6 kcal. So yeah, about -57 kJ or -13.6 kcal per mole of H+ reacting.

But wait, some sources say the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol (or approximately -13.6 kcal/mol) for strong acids and strong bases. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's about -57 kJ.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would give 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, in kcal, 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = approximately -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ contributes to the enthalpy change. So if 0.2 moles react, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, if using kcal, 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches, and option B is -11.42 kcal, which is another possible way. Wait, but why would option B be in kcal? Because 0.2 * 13.6 is 2.72, so -2.72 kcal is correct. Alternatively, if I use kJ, it's -11.4 kJ.

Wait the options have A as -2.72 kcal, which aligns with this. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our calculated -11.4 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Did I calculate the moles correctly?

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2, which is less than the 0.28 H+, so OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ react with 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction is: 0.2 moles H+ + 0.2 moles OH- → 0.2 moles H2O.

So enthalpy change is 0.2 * ΔH per mole.

If ΔH is -57 kJ/mol, then it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. If I'm using kcal, that's 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal.

So looking at options, A is -2.72 kcal, B is -11.42 kcal, which is close to -11.4 kJ when converted. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is 2.716 kcal (since 11.4 kJ / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal). So if the option is in kJ, the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, but wait another thing. Enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction. The reaction I'm considering is H+ + OH- → H2O, which is one mole of H+.

But wait, in this case, when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, perhaps the reaction isn't just H+ and OH-.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4 is a diprotic strong acid, so it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So when mixed, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the initial approach is correct. So the limiting reagent is OH-, so only 0.2 moles H+ react.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. Alternatively, -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these solutions are mixed. So the correct value is either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ. So why are options A and B both in kcal? Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.6 kJ, which seems too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me recalculate.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2 mol, which is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol H+ reacts.

So 0.2 mol H+ → 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ → which is same as -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer should be either A or D.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: -2.72 kcal

Option D: -16.0 kJ

Wait, 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (as 11.4 /4.184 is about 2.72). So if the question expects the answer in kcal, it's option A. If in kJ, it's -11.4, which is not an option. Wait, the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.8 kJ. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again about the stoichiometry.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base, so each mole gives two OH- ions. So when it reacts with H2SO4, which is diprotic, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 will react first. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, their reaction might produce BaSO4, which is a precipitate, and water.

So the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

Let me write the balanced equation. H2SO4 has 2 H+ and SO4^2-; Ba(OH)2 has Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So combining them, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

So per mole, it's 1:1 ratio.

So moles H2SO4: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.

Moles Ba(OH)2: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is 0.09 mol, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol. So H2SO4 is the limiting reactant here because it's less.

So they'll react to produce 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O. So the H+ from H2SO4 is consumed in this reaction, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is also consumed.

Wait, but HCl is another acid present. So after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, any excess OH- or H+ will remain.

Wait, let me calculate how much OH- and H+ are consumed in the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1, producing BaSO4 and 2 H2O. So each mole of H2SO4 consumes 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, but each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

Wait, in the reaction, H2SO4 (which has 2 H+) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (which has 2 OH-). So the neutralization would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Which can be broken down into:

2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized by 2 moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol. The Ba(OH)2 provides 0.1 mol * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So in the reaction, 0.18 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH- from Ba(OH)2 are consumed. But wait, the Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol, which gives 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, no. The reaction is 1:1 between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

Each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

Each H2SO4 provides 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 first react to neutralize each other's H+ and OH-, producing water and BaSO4.

So after this reaction, how much OH- or H+ remains?

Ba(OH)2 initially is 0.1 mol, but only 0.09 mol reacted, so 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 remains. But wait, no, because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely. So if 0.09 mol of Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol, which dissociates into 0.02 mol OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, the total Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol, and 0.09 mol reacts with H2SO4. So the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, which will dissociate into 0.02 mol OH-.

But wait, there's also HCl present, which is a strong acid, so it will donate H+.

So after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, there's some H+ from HCl and some OH- from the unreacted Ba(OH)2.

So let's recalculate the moles.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → all reacts, as it's the limiting reactant.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol total. 0.09 mol reacts with H2SO4, leaving 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

So now, after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction, the remaining species are:

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol.

So the H+ and OH- will react again:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

The available H+ is 0.1 mol, OH- is 0.02 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent again. 0.02 mol OH- will react with 0.02 mol H+.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized in both reactions are:

From H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol H+ neutralized.

From HCl and remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol H+ neutralized.

Total H+ neutralized: 0.20 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is either option A (-2.72 kcal) or option B (-11.42 kcal), but wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is -11.42 * 4.184 ≈ -47.8 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 doesn't involve any H+ from HCl.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total H+ from all acids and the total OH- from all bases.

Wait, the total H+ is from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

So the neutralization will involve 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, leading to 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is same as -2.72 kcal.

I think the confusion arises because sometimes the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ or per mole of reaction. But in this case, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol, so the enthalpy is 0.2 * 57 kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our calculation. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for each type of acid and base is considered differently. For example, H2SO4 as a diprotic acid might have a different enthalpy per H+.

Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ neutralized, regardless of the source. So whether it's from HCl or H2SO4, each H+ contributes the same amount.

So the correct total is 0.2 mol H+ neutralized, leading to -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal → this matches the 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal/mol) → correct.

B) -11.42 kcal → which is about -47.8 kJ, which is too high.

C) -3.80 kcal → which is about -16 kJ, perhaps if someone miscalculates.

D) -16.0 kJ → doesn't match.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, the options have option D as -16.0 kJ, which is 0.2 * (-80 kJ/mol). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the value of the enthalpy per mole. Let me check.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base. For example, a monoprotic acid and a monoprotic base would have ΔH = -57 kJ per mole of acid (or base), which is equivalent to -28.5 kJ per mole of H+ because each mole of acid contributes one H+.

Wait no, that can't be right. Wait, for a monoprotic acid, one mole of acid gives one mole of H+. So the enthalpy per mole of acid is -57 kJ, which equals -57 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the standard value. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid (like HCl) and strong base (like NaOH) is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

So in this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, leading to 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So option A is correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the options have D as -16.0 kJ. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of water, so maybe the enthalpy per mole of reaction is different. For example, if the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction is 2 * (-57) = -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But wait, no, because each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, so the neutralization of 2 H+ would release 2 * 57 = 114 kJ, so ΔH is -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But in this problem, we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting, so the ΔH would be 0.09 * (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol, and the remaining OH- is 0.02 mol, so neutralization is 0.02 mol H+ → 0.02 * (-57) = -1.14 kJ. So total ΔH would be -10.26 -1.14 = -11.4 kJ, which matches the previous calculation.

So the correct answer is either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal. The options have both A and D: A is -2.72 kcal, D is -16 kJ.

Wait, but 0.2 * 57 is 11.4, so 0.2 * 57 = 11.4. So the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct option is A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal. So B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -47.8 kJ, which doesn't match.

So the correct answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **H⁺ ions from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so each mole contributes one H⁺.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Thus, moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H⁺ ions from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H⁺.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Thus, moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

   Total H⁺ from both acids = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so each mole contributes two OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Thus, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

The limiting reactant is OH⁻, as there are only 0.2 moles of OH⁻ to react with the 0.28 moles of H⁺. Therefore, 0.2 moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ will react to form water, leaving 0.08 moles of unreacted H⁺.

The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) (or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)) per mole of H⁺ neutralized. Since 0.2 moles of H⁺ are neutralized:

- **In kJ**:  
  \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

- **In kcal**:  
  \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-13.6) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: This is inconsistent, as \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to \( -47.8 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: This does not match the calculation.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: This is larger than the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) and is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change in kcal.

Answer: A
