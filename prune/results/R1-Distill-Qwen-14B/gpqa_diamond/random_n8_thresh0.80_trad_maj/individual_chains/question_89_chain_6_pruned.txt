Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it out.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a particular way. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane skeleton.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—those bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Are they adjacent? I think adamantane's structure has each carbon connected in a certain way. Let me visualize it. Adamantane's structure: each carbon is part of multiple rings. So if the bromines are on 1 and 3, are those adjacent? Wait, in adamantane, the structure is similar to a diamond. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are on opposite ends of a bridge. Hmm, maybe not adjacent. That would be important because if they are not adjacent, elimination might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure allows for the formation of a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a diepoxide or some other structure, but no, the starting material is a dihalide. So when KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But if they're on non-adjacent, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. So maybe elimination is more likely. If KOH is in excess and heated, it's probably an elimination reaction forming an alkene. But if the dihalide isn't vicinal, elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the IR spectrum of product 1 shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe instead of elimination, it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by something. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Oh wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis. If the starting material is a dihalide, perhaps under basic conditions, it undergoes a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, if the two bromines are in positions where substitution can occur, maybe we get a diol? But the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, maybe it's not substitution but elimination. Let me think: if the dihalide is heated with a strong base, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxide, but that would make a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches around 3300, which would be the case for a diol. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but again, if the Brs are on adjacent carbons, that would make sense. But if they are not adjacent, elimination isn't possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is a 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it undergoes an elimination to form a ketone. How? Because if each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps the elimination isn't possible, but maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to a carbocation, but that's less likely with KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a bridgehead double bond, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule, which states that double bonds don't form at bridgeheads in bicyclic compounds because of poor orbital orientation. So perhaps elimination isn't the way.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dihalide undergoes a nucleophilic substitution with KOH, where each Br is replaced by an -O⁻ group, but that would form a di-ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe the KOH acts as a base and deprotonates the compound, but that's unclear.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So maybe the dihalide undergoes a substitution where two Br atoms are replaced by hydroxyl groups, but wait, that would form a diol. However, a diol would have O-H stretches in the IR around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe it's ketone formation. How?

Wait, maybe one Br leaves, and the other is involved in an elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs undergo elimination to form a ketone. Oh! Wait, if two adjacent Brs are present, elimination can form a double bond. But if they're not adjacent, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what product 1 is. It has a 1H NMR spectrum with peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, another possibility: The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, maybe it undergoes a substitution where one Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would form a mono-substituted alcohol. But then, where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation. Oh, wait, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, but maybe something else is happening. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH induces a ring-opening elimination, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that upon treatment with KOH, it forms a cyclopropane ring. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the product forms an epoxide, but that would require an oxygen source.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high ppm, maybe an -OCH2- group or something like that. The 2.41-2.23 region for 10H suggests that's from the adamantane structure—maybe the bridgehead protons. The 1.94 ppm for 2H could be more CH2 groups.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but how does that form a ketone? Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the Br is replaced by an oxygen group leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: KOH can act as a base, causing elimination. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge. So when KOH is used, each Br leaves, and the adjacent C-H bonds break, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, so maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridge, and elimination forms a ketone. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about another scenario: maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but for that, we need a quaternary ammonium salt, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation. But I'm not familiar with such a scenario in adamantane systems. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a ring-opening reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but I don't see how that would form from KOH.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules, forming a carbonyl group. How? If two adjacent Brs are present, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but that's not possible due to Bredt's rule. Wait, but if the structure isn't a bridgehead, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanedione? No, that's a possibility. So, if each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, but that would require two substitution reactions. However, I'm not sure how KOH would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but I'm not seeing it clearly. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, implying that one Br is replaced by a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a single elimination, forming a ketone. Let me visualize: if one Br leaves, and a base abstracts a proton adjacent to the other Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about what product 1 is. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is high, perhaps for an -OCH2- group. But wait, if it's an epoxide, the O would be in the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to CH2 groups.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a diol, but as I thought earlier, the IR doesn't show O-H stretches. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, how else can a dihalide form a ketone? Maybe via a substitution where one Br is replaced by an -O- group, and then some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a de
