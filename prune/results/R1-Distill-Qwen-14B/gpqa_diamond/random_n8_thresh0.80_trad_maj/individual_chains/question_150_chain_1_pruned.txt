Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and it's reacting through a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H

Hmm, okay. 9.72 ppm is a pretty high chemical shift for a proton. That's usually indicative of an aldehyde proton. Wait, but waitâ€”aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's a clue. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton or something else, but aldehyde seems more likely.

Looking at the other peaks: The doublets around 6.98 and 6.51 suggest some aromatic protons. The 6.98 d, 2H and 6.51 d, 2H could be para-substituted aromatic rings. Because in para substitution, you'd get two doublets for each pair of protons. Wait, but why two different doublets? Oh, perhaps the compound has two different aromatic rings attached. Oh, like maybe two phenyl groups attached to something else. Each with substituents.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet, 2H. Broad usually suggests exchange, like with OH groups. But wait, in this case, it's 2H. Oh, maybe it's an enol proton? Or maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative group. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with some coupling? Or maybe it's a di-substituted double bond.

The 3.66 ppm doublet, 2H, that's likely an OCH2 group. Because OCH2 protons typically show up in that region, and as a doublet, maybe adjacent to something else, like another CH2 group or perhaps an oxygen.

Putting this together: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5 degrees of unsaturation. So that's 5. Which could be, say, a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or another double bond (maybe another ring or a carbonyl). Wait, or a carb
