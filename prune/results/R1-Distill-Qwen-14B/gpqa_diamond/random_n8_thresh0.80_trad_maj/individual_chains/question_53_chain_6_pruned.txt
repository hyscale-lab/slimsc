Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR shows an ester group, which I remember has strong absorption around 1730 cm^-1, so that's a clue. 

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me parse each of them:

1. Two aromatic-H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern must influence the splitting. Di-substituted rings can have different patterns: ortho, meta, or para. Para substitution usually gives two sets of equivalent protons, each as a singlet if the substituents are symmetrical. Ortho substitution might lead to more complex splitting.

2. Two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are typically CH2=, but wait, no because then the NMR would probably show more splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group in a double bond. Wait, but if it's a double bond, like in an ester group, perhaps. Or maybe the vinyl is part of another structure, like a substituent attached to the aromatic ring. The fact that one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with adjacent protons. For example, in a group like CH2-CH2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group with substituents. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. Methine (CH3) groups usually show up around 1 ppm, but it depends on the environment. The absence of –CH2 groups in the NMR suggests that the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. So all the CH3 are isolated, maybe attached to an oxygen or another group.

Putting this together, the compound is an ester, which has the structure R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So two substituents on the aromatic ring: possibly an ester group and something else.

Wait, the di-substituted aromatic ring has two substituents. Let's think about the possible structures. Let's consider the aromatic ring with two groups attached: one being an ester and the other maybe another group like a methyl, ethyl, or another ester.

Wait, but the FTIR shows an ester, so that's one substituent. The other substituent could be another group. Alternatively, maybe both substituents are ester groups, but that seems less likely unless it's a di-ester.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. Six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. Oh, wait, the two vinyl signals come from two separate vinyl groups? Or maybe they're part of the same group but split into two due to coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the aromatic ring is an ester group and another group that has a vinyl proton. For example, if one substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-OR) and the other is a vinyl group, perhaps as part of a substituent like -CH2-CH2-O- but that might bring in CH2 groups which are not present, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a group like -CH2-CH3, but wait, that would give CH2 signals, which are absent. So the substituents must not have any CH2 groups.

Wait, the other substituent besides the ester could be something like a methoxy group. But that would be OMe, which doesn't have protons that would show up as CH3 in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a methyl group. Wait, but the CH3 signals are two, so perhaps each substituent has a CH3 group, or there are two methyl groups elsewhere.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so maybe each substituent has an ester group. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester (like -COO-R) and the other is a methyl group attached directly to the ring.

Wait, so the structure could be something like para-substituted methyl and ester groups. Let's think about that. For example, the ring has a methyl group (-OCH3 maybe?) and an ester group like -COOCH2CH3 or something else.

But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals, so perhaps there are two different methyl groups. So maybe the ester is something like methyl propionate attached to the ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. Ester groups are typically R-O-CO-R'. So if the substituent on the ring is an ester, it would be O-CO-O-R attached to the ring. Wait no, the ester structure is R-O-CO-R'. So if the ring has -O-CO-O-R
