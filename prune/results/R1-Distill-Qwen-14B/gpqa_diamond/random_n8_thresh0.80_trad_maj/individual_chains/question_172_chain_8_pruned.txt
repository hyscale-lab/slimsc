Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted. Oh right, I think it's the outermost layer we can see. The question says something about iron atoms in the photosphere being in specific energy levels. 

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh, I think that relates to the excitation of electrons in the atoms. Maybe it's about the population of energy levels. Oh, right! In stars, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. 

So the Boltzmann distribution equation relates the number of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. 

The formula I recall is N2/N1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait, wait, E2 is higher than E1, so if E2 - E1 is positive, the exponent becomes negative, making the ratio less than 1. 

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that ΔE. So for star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. So N1/N2 = 2. So N1/N2 = 2, which would be [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio N2/N1 equals exp( -(E2-E1
