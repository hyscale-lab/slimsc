Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let's see what the problem says.

First, the reactions are laid out step by step. Let me break them down one by one.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 1:8 for A to B. I'm trying to think of reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something? Wait, sulfur is bright red, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2?

Wait, the product C then reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio (2 equivalents) to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Oh, that makes me think of the formation of something like phosgene or some other toxic gas. Or maybe something like chlorine trifluoride? Not sure yet.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Strong and weak acids from a reaction with water. So maybe C is a chloride compound that when hydrolyzed gives HCl (strong) and another acid. Alternatively, if C were something like SOCl2, which when hydrolyzed gives HCl and H2SO4. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but wait, I thought H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second is weaker. But the problem says F is strong and G is weak. So maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is something like H2S (weak)? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is ClF3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is something like CCl4? No, that doesn't make sense in the next reactions.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. Solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B. Maybe A is sulfur, and B is fluorine? Wait, S + F2. But S8 is a solid, and reacts with F2 to form SF6? But SF6 is colorless, I think. Or maybe C is SO2 or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine gas (Cl2). Sodium reacting with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio? Wait, the reaction of sodium with chlorine is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents of B, so the ratio would be 1:8. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. Then D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B combine in 1:1 to make H. If B is Cl2, then D could be something like H2O? No, but H would be HClO or something. Alternatively, if B is O2, maybe D is H2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, that's possible. Let me write that down.

So B is O2, D is H2. Then reaction of D and B is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So H is H2O
