Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology, specifically about a ligand-receptor pair and a genetic construct. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

The question describes a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct, so they're using a single vector to express both the ligand and the receptor. They've placed the ligand's open reading frame (ORF) at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Oh wait, the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so it should drive continuous expression of the ligand. But wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and there's a stop cassette with loxP in between. Then the receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the translation of the second gene without the need for a second promoter. So maybe the ligand and receptor are co-expressed from the same transcript but are separate ORFs?

Wait, so the vector is constructed with the ligand first, then the receptor. The ligand is under CBA, which should be strong. The receptor is preceded by an IRES, so translation can occur independently. So the ligand and receptor should both be expressed when the vector is transfected.

But in the question, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The total proteins gave a signal proportional to actin, which suggests the loading was correct. So it's possible the proteins were expressed, but maybe not in the right way.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells. The Cre would recombine the loxP sites, perhaps removing the stop cassettes.

Wait, the vector has stop cassettes. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in a loxP cassette between them. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but with Cre, the stop would be removed, allowing expression of the ligand ORF and mCherry? Wait, no. Let me think again. The vector is set up as ligand (with CBA promoter), then the stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. So the ligand is in frame with mCherry, but the stop cassette would prevent expression unless the loxP sites are recombined. So when Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassette, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as a fusion protein? Or perhaps allowing the ligand and mCherry to be separate? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. If the ligand ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, then without Cre, the stop would prevent expression beyond the ligand. But with Cre, the loxP sites would be recombined, and the stop would be removed. So the ligand ORF would be expressed, and then the mCherry could also be expressed? Or perhaps the ligand is fused to mCherry. So the construct would have the ligand and mCherry as a fusion. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, after the IRES, and followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So the receptor is fused to eGFP, and the stop cassette is in between. Cre would recombine lox2272, removing the stop and allowing eGFP to be expressed. Or wait, lox2272 is a different recombinase site. Oh, right, because loxP and lox2272 are different recombinase target sites, and Cre can only recognize loxP. So maybe the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by Cre, so the stop cassette remains. Hmm, that could be a problem.

So the mouse model is homozygous for this construct. Then they crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, which would recombine loxP sites but not lox2272. So the ligand's stop cassette would be cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is under lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor's ORF would be followed by a stop, preventing eGFP from being expressed. So the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't made.

Wait, but wait. The ligand and the receptor are both on the same vector, but each is under separate
