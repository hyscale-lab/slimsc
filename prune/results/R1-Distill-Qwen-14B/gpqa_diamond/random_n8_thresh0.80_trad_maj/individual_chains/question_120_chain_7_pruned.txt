Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The formula I recall is that parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky—I think that probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space, not clustered. So, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume of that region.

Wait, but since we're dealing with parallax, which is inversely proportional to distance, maybe I should think in terms of distance intervals. Let's say we have a small range of parallax, like from plx to plx + dplx. What's the corresponding distance range?

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases, d decreases. Wait, no, wait. No, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger plx means the star is closer. So a small plx means the star is far away.

So, if I consider a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area (4πd²) times thickness.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, I should probably express everything in terms of plx.

So, the number of stars in a volume depends on how much volume there is. So, for a given parallax range, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume times the number density of stars.

Assuming uniform distribution, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's call it n. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV.

So, the volume element in terms of distance is 4π d²
