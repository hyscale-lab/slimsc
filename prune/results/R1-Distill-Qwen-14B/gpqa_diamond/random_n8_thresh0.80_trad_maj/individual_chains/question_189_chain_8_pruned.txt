Okay, so I've got this question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is asking which of the given effective particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

First, I need to remember what each of these particles are and what kind of symmetries they relate to.

Starting with phonons. Phonons are quantized vibrations of a crystal lattice. I think they arise from the quantization of sound waves in solids. They are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry when a crystal forms a lattice structure. Wait, no, actually, in a solid, the translational symmetry is broken because the atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice. So phonons are related to the broken translational symmetry. But wait, phonons themselves are bosons, and they are the result of symmetry breaking in the lattice structure. So, yes, they are linked to a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Next, Skyrmions. Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain magnetic materials. They were originally proposed as a model of atomic nuclei, but more recently they've been studied in contexts like neutron stars and more commonly in magnetic systems. Skyrmions arise due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the arrangement of magnetic moments. So Skyrmions are definitely tied to a broken symmetry.

Then, Magnons. Magnons are quantized spin waves in magnetic materials. They describe the collective excitations of spins in a magnetically ordered material. These ordered states often come from the spontaneous breaking of rotational or translational symmetry—for example, in ferromagnetism, the spins align in a particular direction, breaking rotational symmetry. So Magnons are also connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Lastly, Pions. Pions are subatomic particles, specifically pseudoscalar mesons. In particle physics, the pions are associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetry in the strong interaction. The chiral symmetry is broken in the vacuum state of QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), and pions are the Goldstone bosons resulting from this breaking. So Pions are definitely tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Wait, but the question is asking which is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So if all the options A, B, C, D except one are linked to a broken symmetry, the one that's not would be the answer.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Are phonons tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking? Phonons arise in solids because the atoms form a periodic lattice. So the translational symmetry is broken, but is that spontaneous? I think that in a crystalline solid, the symmetry breaking is due to the formation of the crystal lattice, which is a spontaneous process—so yes
