Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as the base. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's probably involved in an elimination or some kind of addition-elimination reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a ketone, specifically a cyclohexanone derivative. When a ketone reacts with something like ethyl acrylate, I'm thinking maybe it's a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the base deprotonates the alpha position of the ketone, and then the nucleophile (the acrylate) attacks?

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The starting ketone has substituents at positions 2 and 6. 2-ethyl and 6-methyl, and another methyl at position 2 as well. So the cyclohexanone is pretty substituted. The base, t-BuOK, is bulky, so it would prefer to abstract a proton that's more accessible, maybe in a less hindered position.

Wait, in cyclohexanones, the alpha hydrogens are generally at positions adjacent to the carbonyl. So in 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1. The alpha carbons would be positions 2 and 6. Wait, no, position 2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl groups, so maybe the alpha protons are at position 3? Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, the structure: cyclohexan-1-one means the ketone is at position 1. The substituents are at 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the possible alpha hydrogens would be on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group. So that would be position 2 and position 6, but position 2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl, so maybe position 3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the base might deprotonate at position
