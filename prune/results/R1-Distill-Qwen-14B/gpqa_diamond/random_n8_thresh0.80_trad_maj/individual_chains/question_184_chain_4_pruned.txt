Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure of the target molecule. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). Wait, but waitâ€”wait, I need to get the numbering right. Let me think: in benzene, numbering starts so that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions, making it meta? Or maybe it's more about the order of addition.

Wait, no, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the benzene ring has those three groups in that arrangement.

I need to figure out how to introduce these substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Let me think about the directing effects. Benzene is initially activated and undergoes electrophilic substitution. But once substituents are added, each will direct incoming groups based on their nature.

The nitro group is a strong meta director. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director. The tert-butyl group is an activating, but since it's bulky, maybe it's more of a para director, but I'm not sure. Wait, tert-butyl is an alkyl group, so it's an activating, ortho/para director. But because it's bulky, it tends to direct incoming groups more towards the para position because the ortho positions are sterically hindered.

So the synthesis steps would involve adding each substituent in a way that directs the next group to the correct position.

But wait, the substituents are a mix of activating and deactivating groups. Nitro is deactivating, while ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating. So the order in which we add these groups is crucial because each step affects where the next substituent goes.

Let me think about the possible steps. Starting with benzene, first substitution could be adding the tert-butyl group. Then, adding the nitro group, then the ethoxy group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe adding the nitro first, but that would deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions harder. Hmm.

Wait, the target has a nitro group at position 3. If I add nitro early, the ring becomes deactivating, which could complicate adding the other groups. Alternatively, perhaps adding the activating groups first to facilitate the nitro addition.

Wait, but nitro is a strong meta director. So if I add nitro after some activating groups, it might go into a particular position.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Add tert-butyl group. Since benzene is activated, this would
