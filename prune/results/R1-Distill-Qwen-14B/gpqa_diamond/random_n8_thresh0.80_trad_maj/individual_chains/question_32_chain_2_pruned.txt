Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's lithium-6 because lithium typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. 

Wait, right, the problem states X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li normally has 3 protons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so in this case, it's colliding Li-6 nuclei. The energy of the collider is related to the kinetic energy of these ions. But wait, particles in colliders are accelerated to high speeds, and their total energy is their kinetic plus rest mass energy. But I think the question is asking about the total energy, maybe the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to think about that.

The speed given is 0.96c. So first, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus moving at this speed. Using special relativity, I think the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So let's calculate gamma when v = 0.96c. Let me compute that. 

v = 0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is approximately 3.571428... So gamma
