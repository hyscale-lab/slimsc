Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is where the star emits most of its light, and if we assume Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), then each part behaves like a blackbody.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's a specific value, but maybe it's a constant or relates to k*T or something. Oh wait, Boltzmann's constant is k = 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, interesting, so the energy difference ΔE is k times T, perhaps? Or maybe it's related to the excitation energies based on temperature.

The problem is about the ratio of excitation levels. In LTE, the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. The excitation probability is given by the Boltzmann distribution. So the ratio of the populations in two energy levels is given by (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). 

Wait, wait, so if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2 in that energy level, that ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Or wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the excitation level (n_upper) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 would be twice that of star_2's ratio.

Wait, no. Wait, let's get this straight. Let me denote for star_
