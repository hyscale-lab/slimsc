Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty of P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. The state is provided, and I need to compute the uncertainty. Alright, let me break this down.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So, I'll need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in a specific state, which is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, I can directly compute the expectation values without worrying about changing the basis, I think.

Wait, the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in matrix form. So, I should probably compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal (as per its matrix form), maybe the calculations will be easier.

Let me look at the matrix of P_z. The matrix has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So, it's diagonal: P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

Wait, but wait a second, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of P_z are these values. So, if |ψ⟩ is a column vector, each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. So, the vector is in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, which makes sense.

So, the state is given as (a, b, c) = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me compute the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, which for a diagonal matrix would be a*(P_z[1,1])*a + b*(P_z[2,2])*b + c*(P_z[3,3])*c. Wait, no, the components are |a|² * ħ + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ). Because P_z has eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, no, more accurately, because P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So, the expectation value is:

⟨P_z⟩ = (a) * (ħ) * (a*) + (b) * (0) * (b*) + (c) * (-ħ) * (c*).

But since in this case, the state |ψ⟩ is given as a real vector, the complex conjugate doesn't change anything. So, a is -1/2, b is 1/sqrt(2), c is -1/2.

So
