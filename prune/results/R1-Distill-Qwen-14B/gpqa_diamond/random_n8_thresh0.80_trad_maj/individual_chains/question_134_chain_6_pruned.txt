Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question gives me three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are mixed together.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But here, I have two acids and a base. Oh, wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So mixing an acid with a base will produce a neutralization reaction.

But wait, I need to figure out how much of each is reacting. Because when you mix them, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. So the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base will determine how much neutralization occurs.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

HCl is a strong acid and it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

So for HCl: 0.5 liters (because 500 mL is 0.5 L) multiplied by 0.2 mol/L. Oh wait, wait, no: 500 mL is 0.5 L, so 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles of HCl, which gives 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, right? It can donate two H+ ions per molecule. But wait, at high concentrations, does it dissociate completely? Well, in strong acids, the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be. Wait, but in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is considered to dissociate completely as H+ and HSO4^- first, and then the HSO4^- can dissociate further, but perhaps not completely if dilute. Hmm, but for the purpose of this problem, I think it's safe to assume that in solution, each H2SO4 molecule contributes 2 H+ ions. Because in strong acid solutions, H2SO4 typically donates both protons. Or maybe not. Wait, sometimes only the first dissociation is complete, and the second is not, so maybe each H2SO4 gives one H+ initially
