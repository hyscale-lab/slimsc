Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But since this is relativistic, things are probably different because of the effects of special relativity.

Okay, the setup is a mass m attached to a spring obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The maximum amplitude is A, and we're to find the maximum speed v_max. Hmm, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so relativistic effects must change this.

In relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy, and the expression is more complicated. The total energy E for a particle moving at speed v is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the system's energy comes from the spring potential and the particle's relativistic kinetic energy. Wait, but in the maximum speed case, the potential energy of the spring is converted into the particle's kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma - 1)mc². So perhaps the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² in classical mechanics. But when relativistic effects are considered, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². But wait, wait, no. Actually, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. So perhaps the total mechanical energy (the sum of kinetic and potential) is not conserved in the same way as before, because the potential is from a spring which is a conservative force, but the kinetic term is relativistic.

Wait, but for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, I think the approach might be a bit different. Let me think. So the force is F = -kx, but that's a bit tricky in relativity because F would have to relate to acceleration via relativistic equations of motion. But maybe it's better to approach it through energy.

At the maximum amplitude A, the particle is at rest momentarily in the classical case, so all energy is potential. Then, as it moves through the equilibrium point, the potential
