Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is often involved in Diels-Alder reactions. Let me think about what that entails.

Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. So first, I need to identify the diene and the dienophile in this reaction. Maleic anhydride is a good dienophile, right? So the other reactant must be the diene here.

Looking at 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene, the structure has a cyclopentadiene ring with a fluorine substituent. Wait, cyclopentadiene is the conjugated diene. So the diene is the cyclopentadiene part, and the dienophile is the maleic anhydride.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is usually the electron-rich component, and the dienophile is electron-deficient. Maleic anhydride is a good dienophile because it's electron-deficient due to the electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride oxygen atoms).

So the diene is the cyclopentadiene. But wait, the position of the fluorine is at the 5 position. How does that affect the diene? Let me imagine the structure. Cyclopenta-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. Fluorine is at position 5, which is adjacent to the double bonds? Hmm, perhaps it's on a carbon next to one of the double bonds.

In a Diels-Alder, the diene needs to be in the s-cis conformation. But cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, so it's usually good for this. Wait, but cyclopent
