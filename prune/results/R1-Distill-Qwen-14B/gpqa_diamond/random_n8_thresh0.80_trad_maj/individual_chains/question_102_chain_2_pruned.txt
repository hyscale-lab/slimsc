Okay, so I've got this complicated question about a genetic construct and why a certain fluorescent marker isn't showing up. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the setup. The question is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is this monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making the binding site. But the important thing here is the construct they made.

They used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two genes under the same transcriptional unit. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, after that, there's a stop with loxP. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus, and it has a stop with lox2272. 

Wait, bicistronic vectors typically have one promoter driving two genes, often separated by an IRES or something. Oh wait, the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. So the setup is probably: CBA promoter -> ligand (with stop in loxP) followed by IRES, then receptor (stop in lox2272) and eGFP.

But wait, how does the loxP and lox2272 cassettes work here? Oh right, loxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. When Cre is expressed, it deletes the regions between the loxP sites. So if a stop is between the ligand and mCherry, and they're flanked by loxP, then in the presence of Cre, the stop would be removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together.

So the idea is probably that without Cre, the ligand is expressed along with mCherry, because the stop is in a loxP cassette, so the ligand is read through, and since it's fused to mCherry, it would produce a ligand-mCherry fusion. But wait, no, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but the stop is in the cassette. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then the loxP-stop-loxP cassette is between ligand and mCherry. So in the construct, it's like ligand (with its own ORF) followed by a stop, which is flanked by loxP. So without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so mCherry would be expressed along with the ligand.

Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus, and between them is a stop with lox2272. So without Cre, the receptor would be expressed but not eGFP, because the stop is in place. With Cre, the stop is removed, so eGFP would be expressed.
