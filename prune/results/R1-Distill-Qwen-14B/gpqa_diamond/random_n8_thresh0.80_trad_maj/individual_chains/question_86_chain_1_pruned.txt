Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Hmm, wait, no, actually, looking again, the products are both the same compound but with different configurations. Wait, no, no, wait. The products are R and S respectively. Let me clarify: Reaction A gives (R)-product, and reaction B gives (S)-product.

The question is about selecting the proper starting materials (A and B) for each of these reactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different starting materials for A and B.

First, I need to figure out what kind of reactions are happening here. The reagents are LiBH4 and BH3 followed by H+. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but BH3 is a milder one, or maybe it's used in different conditions. Oh, but wait: BH3 is a borane, and when used with H+ (like in acidic conditions), it's typically used for hydroboration reactions. But wait, in this case, the product is a ketoneâ€”tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, how does a reducing agent produce a ketone? That doesn't make sense. Wait, that's the product, but perhaps the starting material is something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: when you reduce a carbonyl group, you usually get an alcohol. But wait, the product here is a tetrahydro pyranone. Oh, wait, maybe it's the reduction of a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Wait, but pyranone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So if the starting material is a lactone, reducing it would give a diol? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Or perhaps the starting materials are ketones or esters that, upon reduction, form the pyranone structure. Hmm, maybe I should think about the starting materials.

Wait, the starting materials are compounds A and B. The products are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one with R and S configurations. So the
