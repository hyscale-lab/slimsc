Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure. Let's think about what that means.

So, a triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm sounds like it's from a methyl group (CH3) adjacent to a CH2 group. Because in NMR, a triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, let me think. If a CH3 is next to a CH2, then each proton in the CH3 would be split into a triplet by the two protons of the adjacent CH2. But wait, no, the integration is 6H, which would be two CH3 groups. Oh, wait, maybe it's a di-substituted group?

Wait, another thought. When you're looking at a triplet with 6H, that's probably two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 would have 3H, so two CH3 groups would be 6H. And the splitting into a triplet suggests that each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2... but wait, wait, the other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies coupling with three neighboring protons, right? Because each proton in the quartet is split by three neighboring H's.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The quartet (four peaks) comes from coupling with a group that has three adjacent Hs. So if a CH2 group is next to a CH3 group, each H in the CH2 would couple with the three Hs of the CH3, hence a quartet. So the 4H (integration) would imply two CH2 groups, each with two Hs.

Putting this together: the NMR suggests a structure where there are two CH3 groups (triplet for 6H) and two CH2 groups (quartet for 4H). So perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, that doesn't add up. Because the quartet is for 4H, which would be two CH2 groups, each 2H. So maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2... No, wait, perhaps it's a diethyl group attached somewhere. Wait, wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group or something else. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) is probably two CH3 groups attached to a single carbon. Because each CH3 would give a triplet. But wait, more accurately, if the CH3 is adjacent to a CH2, the triplet comes from coupling with the two protons in the adjacent CH2. So that would be a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2. But wait, that would be a single CH2 group next to a CH(CH3)2. Then the CH2 protons would show as a quartet because they're next to a CH with two CH3 groups (each CH3 has 3 H, so 6 H in total). Wait, but in that case, the CH2 would be adjacent to a CH that's connected to two CH3 groups. So, the CH2 would be next to the CH(CH3)2, and thus each H in the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH. Wait, no, because the CH(CH3)2 has only one H attached to the central carbon. Oh, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the CH2 would have two H's, each seeing the one H on the adjacent carbon. So each H in the CH2 would couple with one H on the adjacent CH. So that would lead to a triplet, not a quartet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.
