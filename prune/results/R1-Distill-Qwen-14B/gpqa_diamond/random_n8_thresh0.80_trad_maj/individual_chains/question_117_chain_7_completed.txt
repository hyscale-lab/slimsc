Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are chiral. Chiral compounds have a plane of symmetry, and if they lack one, they can have enantiomers which are optically active.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Oh, this sounds like a biphenyl structure with substituents. Let me visualize it. Biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents here are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate groups, and 6 and 6' for the dinitro groups. So, each ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a NO2 group at position 6. Hmm. Now, in biphenyls, the substituents on each ring can lead to different isomerism. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that their positions create a chiral center, then there could be optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe it's about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. For biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, like para on each ring, then maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but let me think: the groups on each ring are at 2 and 6. So on each benzene ring, substituents at 2 and 6 positions are across from each other (since in benzene, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the point of attachment). Wait, no: in a biphenyl, each benzene is attached at position 1. So substituents at 2 and 2' would be adjacent in each ring. Hmm, maybe the biphenyl can have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged in a certain way. But wait, the molecule is dimethyl, so each COOCH3 is at 2 and 2'; each nitro is at 6 and 6'. So, each substituent is at the same position on each ring. Hmm, but if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Alternatively, if the two rings have substituents that are mirror images, but the molecule itself isn't symmetrical, it might be chiral.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, compounds with two rings connected in such a way can have cis-trans isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. But optical isomerism is a specific type of stereoisomerism where the compound is chiral, so it has a non-superimposable mirror image. So for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So if substituents on the biphenyl are arranged such that the molecule is chiral, then it would have optical isomers.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions. I'm trying to imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a COOCH3 at position 2 and a NO2 at position 6. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other (since in benzene, positions 1 and 3 are adjacent, 1 and 4 are para). So if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, that's adjacent to each other. Wait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, etc. So, in a biphenyl, the two benzene rings are connected at position 1. So substituents at position 2 on each ring would be adjacent on each benzene ring, but across the bond. So looking at the structure, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions. If that leads to a lack of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that a mirror plane exists, then the molecule is not chiral. Wait, so if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule symmetric, like if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that the substituents can't be mirrored, then it's chiral. So I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6. So on each ring, substituents at positions 2 (adjacent to the connecting bond) and 6 (opposite to the connecting bond). Hmm, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule as a whole doesn't have a plane of symmetry. So if the substituents are arranged in a way that when you look at the structure, flipping it doesn't produce the same molecule, then it's chiral. So this might exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For example, if both rings have the same substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond, the molecule could be symmetric. Wait, but the substituents in each ring are both COOCH3 and NO2, but their positions are 2 and 6. So for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. So on each ring, substituents are on adjacent positions. Wait, maybe the two substituents on each ring are in positions that are adjacent, leading to a planar arrangement. Hmm, I'm not so sure. Maybe this molecule can have enantiomers, so it would have optical isomerism. So I'll tentatively say that 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure of this is CH3CO-O-CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The carboxylic acid is at the end. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it becomes the methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is O=C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Let me draw this correctly. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH (but actually CH3CH2COOH). Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, correct structure:

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkyl from the acid. So the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the one attached to the OH and the COOCH3 groups) has four different groups: OH, COOCH3, CH2CH3 (from the other CH2?), wait no, wait.

Wait, no, the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the chain is CH3-C-O-OCH3? Wait, no, perhaps I should structure it as:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait no, that's not right. Let me think again. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate: the acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait no, the correct structure is:

The parent acid is propanoic acid, so three carbons in a row: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-O-CH3.

So the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH) connected to 2: CH2 connected to 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, the carbons are arranged as: COOCH3 is on carbon 3, then CH2 (carbon 2) connected to another CH2 (carbon 1) with the OH.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH2(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me number the carbons. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH: so the first carbon is COOH, the second is CH2OH, and the third is CH2 (but wait, that can't be right). Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon (the one attached to the OH and the COOCH3 group). That carbon is attached to:

1. OH group,

2. COOCH3 group,

3. Two CH2 groups (one on each side).

Wait no, wait. Let me see. For the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH2-OH

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the structure is:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the COOH is on the third carbon, the CH2OH on the second, and the CH2 on the first. So when it becomes the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the ester group is at the end. So the molecule is: O

       |
O-CO-OCH3 is attached to a CH2-CH2-OH group.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about the structure again. So, the molecule is (CH2)2(OH)COOCH3. Is there a chiral center here? The central carbon (the one attached to the OH, COOCH3, and two CH2 groups) would have four different substituents?

Wait, let me count: the carbon attached to the OH is connected to:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- CH2CH3 (from the other side?), or wait.

No, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH2 with OH) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two Hs (since it's CH2). Wait, no, that's a CH2 group, so each carbon has two Hs. So the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two Hs. Wait, that can't be a chiral center because it's CH2 (two H's on same carbon) and only two substituents, so no, that can't be a chiral center. Wait, am I making a mistake here? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH),

2: CH2,

3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right because the COOCH3 is on carbon 3, and carbon 2 is a CH2 connected to carbon 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps each carbon is attached as follows:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C(OOCH3)

But wait, how is that connected? Let me try drawing it:

The structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, carbon 1: CH2(OH) connected to carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 3: COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH) (left),

- COOCH3 (right),

- and two H's.

So, four substituents: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, and two H's. Wait, no, the substituents on carbon 2 are:

- one CH2(OH),

- one CH2 (leading to COOCH3),

- two H's.

Wait, no, each CH2 has two H's. So carbon 2 is CH2, so it's connected to two H's. Thus, carbon 2 has substituents: two H's, one CH2(OH), and one CH2 (which is connected to COOCH3). So, all four substituents? No, wait, perhaps not. Wait, no, substituents are groups attached. So, substituents on carbon 2 would be:

- two H's,

- one CH2(OH) group,

- one CH2-COOCH3 group.

Wait, so four substituents? No, a CH2 group has two H's. So, carbon 2 has four substituents: two H's (since it's CH2), one CH2OH, and one CH2COOCH3. Wait, but substituents are considered as the groups attached. So, substituents are:

- H (twice),

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's three different substituents, but with two H's. So, no, this carbon can't have four different groups. Therefore, it's not a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. So, it cannot show optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps there's another chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the COOCH3 group is attached to a chiral center. Let me see. The COOCH3 is on carbon 3. Carbon 3 is connected to:

- O,

- OCH3,

- CH2 (from carbon 2),

- another CH2 (from the same carbon chain? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So carbon 3 is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, it's a carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So, carbon 3 is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl, not a chiral center. So, no chiral center there.

Wait, but what about the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl? That's carbon 2, which we already considered. So, no. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it can't show optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that if there's a chiral center, it would have optical isomers. So in this case, 2 would not have optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me re-examine. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the middle carbon (attached to OH) is a CH2 group, which is CH2 connected to a COOCH3 and another CH2. So, that's not a chiral center. So, no, so 2 would not show optical isomerism. So, I think option 2 is not chiral.

Wait, but wait a second. Another possibility: perhaps I'm considering the wrong structure. What if the structure is different, like the ester is formed from a different position? Alternatively, maybe the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate implies that the ester group is at the end, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propionate chain. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups (but wait, no, each CH2 is connected to another carbon). Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

Wait, that's three substituents, but I'm not considering if any of these are H's. So, the substituents are:

- -CH2COOCH3,

- -OH,

- two H's.

So, the central carbon has two H's, meaning it's CH2, not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here.

Hmm, okay, so I think moiety 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (PhCO)2, so it's a ketone with two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So, structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So, each benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl group.

Now, for benzophenone, does it have any chiral centers? Well, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl, not a chiral center. So, the molecule itself doesn't have any chiral centers. Also, the benzene rings are symmetrical in this structure, so the entire molecule is symmetric. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism. So, option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is E-maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would be (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Wait, no— wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, it has a double bond with the two ester groups on opposite sides.

Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH in trans configuration. Wait, no, wait: maleic acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH in cis? No, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, wait— no, maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric acid is the trans diacid. So, the structure of maleic acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H, but that's not correct. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH in the cis configuration, but wait, no— wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, where the COOH groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in maleic acid, the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same side of the double bond, making it a cis diacid. Fumaric acid is the trans diacid. So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester, where the ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with the two ester groups on opposite sides. So, the structure is CH2=CH(CO2Me)2, but arranged in the trans configuration. Now, in terms of stereoisomerism, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond that was once in a diacid (fumaric acid) which is a trans (E) isomer. So, the dimethyl ester would have that same E configuration.

But does this compound exhibit optical isomerism? Well, optical isomerism arises when there's a chiral center. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let me look at dimethyl fumarate. The molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2
|
C=O
|
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2
|
O

Wait, no, that's not the structure. Let me think again: the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but with the double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, wait: no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? That can't be right because the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, in the trans configuration. So, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a double bond with substituents (COOCH3) on opposite sides.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think: If the molecule is symmetric when you look along the double bond. For example, if the substituents on each end are mirror images across the double bond. In this case, the substituents are the same on each side (both are COOCH3), and arranged trans. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral. So, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, wait a minute. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing cis and trans. If the substituents on each end are the same and opposite, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you have R and R groups on each end and they're trans, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans di-ester of fumaric acid, the structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: could the molecule have a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry? If so, then it's not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate would have a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, making the two halves mirror images. Therefore, the molecule is not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: what if the substituents are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry? For example, if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are different. But in this case, both substituents are COOCH3, so same on each side. So, the molecule is symmetric. Hence, it's not chiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought that some diesters might have optical isomerism. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a geometric isomer but not a chiral molecule. So, geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: can a molecule with a double bond have optical isomerism? No, a double bond itself can't be a chiral center. So, unless a molecule has a chiral center, it can't have optical isomerism. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center; therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. It's (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides. So, the molecule is symmetrical. So, it has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, options:

1: possibly yes,

2: no,

3: no,

4: no,

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 might not have optical isomerism.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, is there any chiral center? No, because the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (COOCH3 groups) and arranged trans. So, the molecule is symmetrical, so it can't be chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. What if the substituents are different? Then, the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are the same, so it's not. So, 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 might have optical isomerism. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: could the molecule have a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry? For dimethyl fumarate, since both substituents on each carbon are the same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical. So, if you imagine a mirror plane through the center of the double bond, each side would mirror the other. So, the molecule isn't chiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps only option 1 has optical isomerism.

Wait, but let's go back to option 1.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, this is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2' (carboxylate groups) and at 6 and 6' (nitro groups). Let me imagine the structure. So, each benzene ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a NO2 group at position 6. So, each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6. Now, the biphenyl is connected at the 1 position of each ring.

So, each ring has substituents at 2 (adjacent to the connecting bond) and 6 (opposite to the connecting bond). So, each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. Now, the question is whether these substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the entire molecule symmetric, or asymmetric, making it chiral.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are in a way that there's no such plane, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think about the arrangement. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. On each ring, the 2 and 6 positions are adjacent to the point of attachment (the 1 position). Wait, no, the 2 position is adjacent to the connecting bond, and the 6 position is across from it.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in such a way that when you rotate the biphenyl, the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the axis of the biphenyl, then the molecule is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the entire molecule asymmetric.

Hmm. Another approach: when a biphenyl has substituents at 2,2' and 6,6', if the substituents on each ring are the same, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. So in this case, each ring has a COOCH3 and a NO2, but their positions are 2 and 6 on each ring. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it not chiral.

Wait, but wait: the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. On each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. So, if the 2 and 6 positions on each ring are across from each other, then perhaps the molecule is symmetric. So, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry through the axis of the biphenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in mirror-image positions, leading to the molecule being symmetric. So, the molecule would not have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected at the 1 position. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, substituent at 2 is adjacent to the connecting bond, and substituent at 6 is opposite. So, each ring has COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6.

If the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry that runs through the axis of the biphenyl. So, when you look down the central bond between the two rings, the substituents on each ring mirror each other. Hence, the molecule would be symmetric, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's assuming that the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Alternatively, if the substituents are in a way that their positions don't mirror each other, then the molecule would be chiral.

Hmm. I'm not entirely confident here. Another approach: think about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. If each substituent on one ring has a corresponding substituent on the other ring in a way that the entire molecule is symmetric, then it's achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, leading to an asymmetric arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific substituents. Each ring has a COOCH3 at position 2 and a nitro group at 6. So, for each ring, the substituents are on adjacent positions relative to the connecting bond. So, when looking at the two rings, the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically, leading to a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would not be chiral.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think about whether a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring can have a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, and if the substituents are the same on each ring, then perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, each ring's substituents might mirror each other across the central bond. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are COOCH3 and NO2. Are these groups symmetrical in any way? Well, both are strong electron-withdrawing groups, but their positions matter more for symmetry.

So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you draw a plane that goes through the central bond between the two benzene rings and is perpendicular to it, then the substituents on each ring would mirror each other across that plane. Hence, the molecule is symmetric and not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are on the same side of the plane, it might not be symmetric. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps the molecule is symmetric, leading to no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1 might have optical isomerism, but now I'm reconsidering.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For a molecule to have a plane of symmetry, there must be a plane that divides the molecule into two mirror-image halves.

In the case of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So, if I imagine the two rings connected at the 1 position, each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6. So, each ring has substituents at positions adjacent and opposite to the connecting bond. If you draw a plane through the central bond (the 1-1' bond) and the midpoint between the two rings, would the substituents mirror each other across that plane?

Hmm. Let me imagine looking down the central bond. The substituents on each ring would be arranged such that for each, the COOCH3 is at 2 (adjacent to the connecting bond) and NO2 at 6 (opposite). If the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents on one ring are on the same side as those on the other ring, then perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric.

Alternatively, if the substituents are on opposite sides, leading to an asymmetric arrangement, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and thus be chiral.

Wait, but this depends on the actual spatial arrangement. If the two substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they're on opposite sides, it might not.

But without a clear idea of the spatial arrangement, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, think about whether the molecule has any stereogenic centers. A stereogenic center is a carbon with four different substituents. In the biphenyl structure, perhaps the carbons where substituents are attached might be stereogenic. Wait, but the carbons in the benzene rings are sp2 hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers. So, perhaps the biphenyl itself can't have a chiral center, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, but biphenyl can have a single bond between the two rings, allowing rotation. So, perhaps the molecule can have cis and trans forms, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, maybe the molecule doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is that only option 4 has optical isomerism. Wait, no, earlier I thought 4 doesn't have. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not sure, but perhaps it's not chiral.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: No chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, symmetric, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers, symmetric, so no.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't include all correct possibilities. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? No, because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (COOCH3) and arranged trans. So, the molecule is symmetrical, not chiral.

So, out of all four options, none have optical isomerism? That can't be right because the question states that some do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again about option 1.

The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Now, if the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But wait, if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, such that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that when you look from the top, the substituents on each ring are in a mirrored arrangement, making the molecule symmetric.

But I'm not entirely certain. So, perhaps I should consider another approach.

Another thought: a molecule is chiral if it's not superimposable on its mirror image. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral.

In option 1, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that for each substituent on one ring, there's a corresponding substituent on the other ring in a position that mirrors it, then the molecule is symmetric and not chiral.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't mirror each other, then the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but in this case, substituents on each ring are in the same positions (2 and 6), and the same groups are attached, so perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Therefore, option 1 would not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that leaves all four options without optical isomerism, which can't be possible because the question asks which do show it.

Hmm. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry.

In option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, I thought there's no chiral center, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me re-examine.

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, which has two H's, so it's not a chiral center. So, no, that's correct.

In option 4, dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers, so no.

Hmm. So perhaps none of the options exhibit optical isomerism, which can't be the case. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think about option 4 again. Wait, dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, it's (E)-dimethyl fumarate. But the molecule has two identical substituents on each end of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetric, making it not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what if the substituents were different? Then, the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, substituents are same. So, no.

So, perhaps none of the options have optical isomerism, but that's not possible because the question states that some do.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 1. Let me think again.

In option 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So, substituents are in adjacent and opposite positions relative to the connecting bond.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, making the molecule symmetric.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another way to approach this.

Another approach: think about the possibility of the molecule being meso. A meso compound is achiral despite having stereogenic centers because of an internal plane of symmetry.

But in this case, the substituents are on benzene rings, which don't have chiral centers. So, perhaps option 1 doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps the biphenyl itself can have different configurations, like cis or trans, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.

So, perhaps none of the options exhibit optical isomerism, which can't be right because the question expects some of them to.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1. Let me think about whether the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral.

If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and the arrangement leads to the molecule being chiral, then option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

I'm really stuck on this. Maybe I should look for other clues.

Wait, another approach: let's look at each option and see which could have a chiral center.

1. Biphenyl structure: no, as the carbons are sp2 hybridized.

2. No chiral center.

3. No chiral center.

4. No chiral center.

Wait, that would imply none have optical isomerism, but that's impossible. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. Wait, but if the substituents are on opposite sides, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral if it's the cis isomer. Wait, no, that would be maleate, not fumarate. So, in cis isomer, the substituents would be on the same side, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises between cis and trans in the context of the ester groups. Hmm.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me try to make a decision.

Based on the above analysis, I think:

1. Perhaps no optical isomerism.

2. No.

3. No.

4. No.

But that's impossible because the options don't include that. Hence, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1. Let me think again.

In option 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, the substituents are on adjacent positions on each ring. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm. I'm not confident about this. So, given the uncertainty, perhaps the correct answer is that only option 4 has optical isomerism. But earlier I thought it didn't.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and options 1 and 4 do have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to conclude that only option 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2,4.

B) 3 and 4.

C) 2 and3.

D)1 and2.

Hmm. From my analysis:

1: possibly yes.

2: no.

3: no.

4: no.

So, only option 1 would have optical isomerism. But looking at the options, option D says 1 and 2, which doesn't fit. Option A includes 1,2,4, which doesn't fit because I think 2 and 4 don't have it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 2. Let me check again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps there's a chiral center here. Let me count the substituents on the central carbon (the CH2).

The central carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

Wait, so substituents are H, H, -CH2COOCH3, and -OH. So, three different groups plus two H's. Wait, no, that's four substituents, but two are H's. So, the central carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center because it has two H's. So, no, no chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps I'm considering the wrong carbon. Maybe the carbon adjacent to the ester group?

In the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the carbonyl group is on the second carbon. Wait, no, the structure is:

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the CH2 group. So, the chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH),

2: CH2,

3: COOCH3.

So, carbon 2 is CH2, connected to carbon 1 and 3.

So, no chiral center in this molecule.

Hmm. So, returning to the options, perhaps none of the options exhibit optical isomerism, which is impossible because the question requires some to.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Now, for this molecule, are there any chiral centers? No, because the double bond is between two carbons each attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (COOCH3), making them not chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate isn't chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, perhaps I'm wrong about option 1, but given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess.

Based on the analysis:

Only option 1 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 1 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1,2). Since I think option 1 has it, but 2 and 4 don't, the correct answer would be only option 1. But none of the options match that. So, perhaps I'm wrong about option 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that option 4 has a chiral center.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the structure of dimethyl fumarate again. It's (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). Each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each carbon is attached to two identical substituents, making them not chiral.

Hence, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, none of the options exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option 2 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

- two H's,

- a CH2(OH),

- a CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2(COOCH3),

- two H's.

So, the substituents are H, H, CH2(OH), and CH2(COOCH3). So, two substituents are the same (H), so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. I'm at a loss. Perhaps the correct answer is that only option 1 has optical isomerism, but given the options, that's not one of the choices. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 4 is chiral.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. But no, the carbons in the double bond don't have four different substituents. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another type of isomerism. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. But if it lacks a plane of symmetry, it's chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that only option 1 has optical isomerism. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 1. Let me think: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetric, then option 1 would have optical isomerism.

In that case, the correct answer would be option A if 1,2,4 have it. But I don't think 2 and 4 do.

Alternatively, perhaps option 1 and 4 have optical isomerism, but no option includes both.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 1,2,4.

Option B: 3 and4.

Option C: 2 and3.

Option D: 1 and2.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my earlier analysis, perhaps the correct answer is option 1 has optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake and only option 4 has it. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should think about another approach. Let's look for which compounds have a possibility of stereoisomerism.

1. Biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6: could have different substituent orientations leading to different isomers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral centers.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers.

So, only option 1 could have optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option that only includes 1. So, perhaps the correct answer is A) 1,2,4. But I don't think 2 and 4 have it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1. Let me think again. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. So, perhaps option 1 does have optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer would be option 1 and 4? Or perhaps only 1.

But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have non-superimposable mirror images.
