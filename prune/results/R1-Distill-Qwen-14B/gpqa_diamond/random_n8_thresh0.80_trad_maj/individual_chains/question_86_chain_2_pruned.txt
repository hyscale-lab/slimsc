Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question involves two reactions with different reducing agents, and I need to determine the correct starting materials A and B that lead to specific products.

Alright, the products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again: the first reaction gives (R)-4-ethyl..., and the second gives (S)-4-ethyl... So, each reaction starts from a different starting material and uses a different reducing agent, leading to diastereomers or enantiomers of the same product.

Wait, the products are both a single enantiomer, but from different starting materials. So the starting materials must be such that when reduced with either LiBH4 or BH3, they form the respective enantiomers.

Hmm, I remember that the reducing agents can influence the stereochemistry of the product. Let me think. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one, I think. Or wait, maybe it's about the reaction conditions, like whether it's a hydroboration reaction or another type.

Wait, no, wait a second. Oh, right, these reactions are probably ketone reductions or something else. Wait, the product is a pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is an epoxide or an ester or something that upon reduction forms this cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a hemiacetal or an acetal? Because when you reduce an acetal, you get a diol. Oh, but here the product is a ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, like a cyclic hemiketal or something else.

Wait, no, perhaps it's an epoxide. Let me think: if the starting material is an epoxide, and you reduce it with a hydride agent. Wait, no, LiBH4 usually reduces epoxides to diols. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals. Let's think: when you reduce a cyclic acetal, perhaps using a hydride reducing agent, you could break the ring. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with an adjacent carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the
