Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused because I'm still new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass—1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But I don't know if the mass matters here because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So maybe mass isn't directly involved in the calculation, but perhaps it's a distractor. I'll focus on the given abundances.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, assuming LTE. The values provided are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2

Wait, I'm a bit unclear on what these [X/Y] notation mean. Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms relative to the solar ratio.

The Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, which means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The notation is [X/H] = log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun. So for the Sun, [X/H]=0. So the given data for the Sun is:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

But for Star_1 and Star_2, their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, so they have the same Fe/H and Mg/H as the Sun. That's interesting.

So for Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H same as Sun → nFe/nH =3.16e-5.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So I need to find [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2] or (n_Si1 / n_Si2)?

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms, so it's n_Si1 / n_Si2. But I need to determine how to find each n_Si in each star.

Let me think. The given data includes [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 dex.

[Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Since [Fe/H]_1=0, n_Fe = n_Fe,sun * n_H / n_H = same as Sun.

Wait, let me compute [Si/Fe]_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But n_Fe1 = same as Sun's because [Fe/H]=0, so n_Fe1/n_H = n_Fe_sun/n_H. So n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log_Sun(n_Si/n_Fe) +0.3.

Let me denote the Sun's ratio as log_Sun(n_Si/n_Fe)= [Si/Fe]_sun. So from the Sun's data, [Si/Fe]_sun can be calculated.

Wait, but the Sun's data is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. Hmm. I might need to figure that out.

Wait, the Sun's [X/H] values are given for Fe and Mg. So for the Sun, [Fe/H]=7.5-12= -4.5, but wait no, wait the way the question is phrased.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^-4.5 ≈3.16e-5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 →nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about Si? Oh, the question doesn't give [Si/H] for the Sun, but perhaps I can find [Si/Fe] for the Sun.

Wait, we can compute [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) - 0 → since [X/Y]_sun=0. So [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But without knowing n_Si_sun, perhaps I can express Si in terms of Fe and another element. Alternatively, maybe I can get [Si/Fe] for the Sun from the given data.

Wait, maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun. If I have the Sun's [Mg/H] and [Fe/H], perhaps via the [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, let's think. The Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun. But wait, no, [X/Y] is the log of (n_X/n_Y) relative to solar. So the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero. So nMg/nSi = nMg_sun / nSi_sun = 1e-5 /nSi_sun.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.
