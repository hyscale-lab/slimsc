Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain groups, maybe like esters or something else.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data given are IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me look at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1. So the broad range around 3400-2500 suggests maybe an O-H stretch or maybe an alkyne C-H stretch? Wait, O-H would be a broad peak, but if it's in that range, it could be a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, sometimes alkenes or alkynes have their C-H stretches in that region. But the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if there's an O-H in the IR, that might suggest a carboxylic acid because they have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300. But the 1720 cm-1 would then be the carbonyl. But wait, another possibility: maybe an ester. Esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740, so that fits. But esters don't have O-H stretches because they don't have free hydroxyl groups. Hmm, but the IR shows a peak in 3400–2500, which is a broad region. Could it be an alcohol? Or maybe an amine? Wait, but no, the IR doesn't show any N-H stretches. Another thought: maybe an alkyne. The 3400-2500 could be the sp C-H stretches, which are usually around 3300, as a sharp peak. But those are usually two peaks. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but I don't see any N-H in the IR, so that seems less likely.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR has several signals: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

The 10.5 ppm is a singlet for 1H. That's a pretty upfield shift, but wait, 10.5 is actually a downfield shift. Oh wait, no, high ppm is downfield. So 10.5 is very downfield. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, could it be a carboxylic acid proton? Because the O-H in carboxylic acids are usually around 10-12 ppm, but they are broad signals. The integration is 1H, so maybe a phenolic -OH? Or maybe a carbonyl group like a ketone? Wait, no, ketones don't have protons. Wait, but 10.5 could be an aldehyde. Or maybe an enol proton?

Wait, let me think. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each 2H, which is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene. So it's probably a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Let me think of the substituents. Like, perhaps a substituent and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – maybe a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom or perhaps a methylene group. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps a CH2 adjacent to something. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group as a doublet, which could be part of a CH(CH3) group. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting that together, the structure might have a benzene ring with a substituent at para position. Let me think: the substituent could have a carbonyl group attached. For example, maybe it's a benzoyl group connected to an ethyl chain. Or perhaps an ester group.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. The benzene ring has two substituents in
