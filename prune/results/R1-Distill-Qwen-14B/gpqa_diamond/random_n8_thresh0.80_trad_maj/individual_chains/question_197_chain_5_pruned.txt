Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what I can do here. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe something like a nitrile or an ester. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used to convert alkyllithium reagents into alkanes, but more importantly, I think they're used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, or maybe in dehydrohalogenation? Or wait, wait, wait—another thought: Red phosphorus is often involved in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh, wait no, that's with other reagents. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the deoxygenation of epoxides or maybe in the Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig uses triphenylphosphine and other things.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out what Compound X is. The question gives me IR and NMR data. Let's look at the IR first. The IR shows strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either N-H stretching (if it's a primary or secondary amine) or O-H stretching (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid). The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group—maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Then, there's a peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so it's probably an aromatic compound.

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. A peak around 10 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually a bit lower, like around 9-10. Alternatively, it's an acidic proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it were a carboxylic acid, the peak would usually be a broad peak and might integrate for the -OH proton, but in this case, it's 1H. Wait, 1H at 10.5—maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around δ9-10 and are deshielded. Alternatively, it could be an O-H in a phenol, but that might be broader and maybe exchange with D2O.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and would be split into doublets. So, for example, a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into doublets. So, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with some substituents, perhaps a substituent that's an electron-withdrawing group.

The other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's think about that. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is probably a -CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, the triplet is at the end of a chain. For example, in an ethyl group, the triplet would be for the CH2 next to the CH3. Or wait, in an isobutyl group, maybe? Let me see: 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H) probably indicates a methyl group attached to something, like a CH(CH3) group. Because a doublet for 3H would suggest coupling with a single neighboring proton. So, for example, a CH(CH3) group would have the methyl as a doublet. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be the two protons on the CH2 adjacent to the CH(CH3). And the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the proton attached to the aromatic ring, perhaps part of a substituent like an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, putting this together: The aromatic ring is para-substituted. So, the substituents are on positions 1 and 3 (if the ring is numbered) or 1 and 4. Wait, no, para is 1 and 4. So, each substituent is in the para positions. Let's think about the substituents.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent on the benzene could be something like an acyl group, maybe an ester or a ketone. Because the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So, if it's an ester, then the carbonyl is at 1720. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the carbonyl is lower, maybe around 1700 or so. Wait, 1720 is more typical for an ester or an aldehyde. But the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10, so maybe it's an ester.

But wait, the IR also shows a peak around 3400-2500, which could be an O-H stretch. If the compound is a phenol, that's possible, but the 10.5 ppm peak is more likely an aldehyde, unless it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is in the 3400–2500 range. So the IR peak there could be the O-H of a carboxylic acid. If that's the case, then the 10.5 ppm peak would be the O-H, but wait, the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but wait: the integration is 1H. Carboxylic acids have two protons in the -OH group, but if it's a single proton, maybe it's a terminal alkyne... No, that's for different peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde with one proton.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's think: Benzaldehyde has the aldehyde proton around 9.8-10 ppm. So, 10.5 is a bit higher, but possible. Then, the IR would have a strong peak around 1720, which for aldehyde is lower, maybe around 1720 is more likely for an ester or ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzoic acid. Then, the IR would have a strong O-H stretch around 3000-2500, and a carbonyl at around 1700, but the given IR has 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester. So, perhaps the compound is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's an ester group.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde proton is a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, broad, that could be an O-H, but if it's 1H, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes usually have a singlet, yes.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene might be an aldehyde group. So, the structure would be benzaldehyde with some substituent. But the question is, what's the substituent?

The NMR shows substituents on the benzene, specifically, the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which are typical for a para-substituted benzene with electron-withdrawing groups. So, if the substituent is an ester group, say, a para-acylbenzene. For example, p-toluoyl chloride or something similar, but this is a more substituted case.

But wait, the other NMR signals are for a chain. Let's think: 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group next to a branching point, like in an isob
