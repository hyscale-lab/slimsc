Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because phosphate buffer solutions can be a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature, so I don't think that affects anything here.

I remember that orthophosphate is H₃PO₄, but it's a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The dissociation steps are:

1. H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Orthophosphate ion here probably refers to HPO₄²⁻ or PO₄³⁻, but I think in this context, it's more likely HPO₄²⁻ because that's the commonly considered orthophosphate ion. Hmm, but wait, what's the exact definition? Oh, right, orthophosphate is H₃PO₄, but in solution, it can dissociate into H₂PO₄⁻, HPO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻. So the question is about the concentration of HPO₄²⁻.

Wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions." I think sometimes orthophosphate refers to the HPO₄²⁻ ion. So that's what we're looking for.

The solution has two components: KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Both are phosphoric acid salts. So this is a buffer solution, I think. Because KH₂PO4 is H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-. So the solution will contain H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions, which can act as a buffer.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

So, to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, I need to calculate the moles of each salt contributing to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. KH₂PO4 dissociates as:

KH₂PO4 → K+ + H₂PO4^-

Na₂HPO4·2H₂O is a hydrated form. Its formula is Na₂HPO4·2H₂O. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O. So each mole of Na2HPO4
