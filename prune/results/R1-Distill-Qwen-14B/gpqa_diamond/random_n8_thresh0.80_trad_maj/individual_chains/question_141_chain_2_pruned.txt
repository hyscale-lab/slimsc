Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh right, that's para-bromobenzene. Wait no, wait. Let me think. The numbering: 1 and 2 positions on benzene. Oh wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so that's the ortho position. So the structure is benzene ring with Br at position 1 and another substituent at position 2. Wait, but wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, I think "d" is deuterium. So maybe it's benzene with Br at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is probably C6H5BrD. So, it's benzene with a Br and a D attached. Hmm, but wait, benzene is C6H6. If you
