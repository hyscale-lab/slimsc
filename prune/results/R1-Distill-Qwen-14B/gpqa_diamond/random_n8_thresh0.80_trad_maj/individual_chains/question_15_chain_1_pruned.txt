Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the question says that two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being considered for transit detection. The researchers have limited time and want to observe the one more likely to transit. Both are Earth-like and detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. They know the minimum masses and periods.

Wait, so both planets have the same mass? Oh, right, same minimum masses. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, and P2 is 3P1. Both have circular orbits.

The stars: the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up same size. Interesting.

Transit probability... I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula, if I recall, is R_star / a (semi-major axis) multiplied by something else, maybe the impact parameter, but for the maximum probability, we probably assume optimal alignment, so the probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (R_star / a) or something like that. Wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * something else?

Wait, no, the transit probability is the geometric probability. The formula is (R_star / a) * (something about the inclination). Wait, no, the geometric probability P is (R_star + R_planet)/a, but if the planet is much smaller than the star, R_planet << R_star, so P â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (some factor). Wait, actually, the formula I think is something like (R_star / a) * (something else), but maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, wait, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbit, but that's not exactly right. Alternatively, it's the probability that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, would cross our line of sight. The probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet << R_star, it's roughly R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the
