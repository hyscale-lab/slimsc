Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with a transgenic mouse model and some issues with protein expression. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They've introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But then, they can't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and noticed something wrong. The options are about why the protein isn't being expressed.

So the main issue is why the protein isn't being overexpressed. Let's think about the possible reasons based on the sequence provided.

Looking at the sequence, I should look for possible issues in the coding region. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's the HA tag sequence, followed by GADD45G coding.

Wait, let me spot any in-frame stop codons. The presence of a stop codon (TAG, TGA, TAA) would cause translation to terminate early. Let me scan through the sequence for these.

Looking through the sequence, I see a lot of codons, but let me spot where any TAA, TAG, or TGA might appear.

Let me go through the sequence in triplets. Let's see:

I'll take the sequence and break it into codons. Let me see:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC CGG ... and so on.

Wait, right there: ATG is the start. Then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine, GAT is aspartic acid, GGT is glycine, etc. Oh wait, here's a TGA. Let me see: ... CTGAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG ... So the TGA is in the sequence. That's a stop codon, right? TGA is a stop codon.

Now, where is this TGA located? So the construct starts with ATG (start), then the HA tag, then GADD45G. If there's a TGA, that's a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation early, not producing the full-length protein. That would explain why the protein isn't being overexpressed. So the problem is that there's an early stop codon.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. So that would fit. But wait, let me look again.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA-GADD45G. If the HA tag's sequence includes a TGA, or perhaps a mutation introduced a TGA, that could cause a premature stop.

Wait, looking at the initial sequence: the first few codons after ATG are TAC (tyr), CCA (pro), TAC (tyr), GAT (asp), GGT (gly), etc. So the TGA I found earlier is at position... let me count. The sequence after the start is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC CGG... 

So after the start codon, the next codon is TAC (tyrosine), then CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA. Oh, that's a stop codon at position 10 or so.

So the TGA is in the construct, which would cause the mRNA to be translated into a protein that stops at that point. So the HA tag is being partially expressed, but the GADD45G portion isn't even getting made because the ribosome stops at the TGA.

Wait, but how did the TGA get into the sequence? The HA tag is a known sequence, correct? So perhaps during the cloning, when they introduced the HA tag, a mutation occurred. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's codon sequence includes a TGA. Let me think about the HA epitope.

The HA tag typically comes from the hemagglutinin of influenza A virus. The standard HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The coding sequence would be something like TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAT TAC GCG CGA GA... Wait, let me write out the DNA sequence for YPYDVPDYA.

YPYDVPDYA: 

Y is TAC,
P is CCA,
Y is TAC,
D is GAT,
V is GTT,
P is CCA,
D is GAT,
Y is TAC,
A is GCT.

Wait, wait, but the sequence in the question is:

After ATG, we have TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, the HA tag should be TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So in the provided sequence, the HA tag should be TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA GAT TAC GCC. Wait, but after that, it's AAA, then TGA. So perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence was not correctly inserted, leading to a TGA in the middle.

So the presence of TGA in the coding sequence after the HA tag would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to a truncated protein, which would be non-functional. So the protein of interest isn't being made because the translation stops early.

Looking at the options:

A) Missense mutation in HA determinant: that would change an amino acid, but not necessarily cause a stop. So the protein would be expressed but maybe not functional. But the problem is no overexpression, so maybe it's not expressed at all.

B) Ribosome terminated early: that's because of a stop codon in the coding sequence. That fits with the presence of TGA.

C) No linker causing proteolysis: that would lead to the protein being degraded, but the construct would still be made. If the protein is made but quickly degraded, maybe you wouldn't see it in expression assays. But in this case, the problem is that the construct isn't made correctly, perhaps.

D) No tRNA for UAA: unlikely, as UAA is a standard stop codon, and mouse cells (CHO) have tRNAs for all standard codons.

So the most likely reason is the presence of a stop codon in the coding sequence, which is option B.


The question involves determining why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) sequence at the N-terminus, fails to produce the expected protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals a critical issue: the presence of the stop codon TGA early in the coding region. This stop codon occurs after the HA tag sequence but before the GADD45G coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. As a result, the full-length HA-GADD45G protein is not produced, leading to the observed lack of overexpression.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Missense mutation in the HA determinant**: A missense mutation would alter an amino acid in the HA tag but would not introduce a stop codon. This would not explain the complete failure of protein expression.
- **B) Ribosome terminated the translation early**: The presence of the TGA stop codon in the coding sequence directly causes premature termination of translation, preventing the production of the full-length protein. This aligns with the observed issue.
- **C) Lack of a linker sequence triggering proteolysis**: While proteolysis could degrade the protein, the issue here is the absence of full-length protein production, which is better explained by the stop codon.
- **D) Lack of tRNA for the UAA codon**: UAA is a standard stop codon, and CHO cells have the necessary tRNAs for translation termination. This is not a plausible explanation.

The most likely cause of the issue is the premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence, which terminates translation early. 

Answer: B
