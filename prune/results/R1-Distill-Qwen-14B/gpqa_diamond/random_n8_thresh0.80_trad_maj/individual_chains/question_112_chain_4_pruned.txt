Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So they form a basis for the spin-1/2 system, I think. That means our state is a linear combination of these basis states.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), their magnitudes will determine the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients should equal 1.

Let me compute each coefficient's magnitude squared. The first coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The second coefficient is (2 - i). Its magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Wait, but the state is proportional to these, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7), right? So |alpha> equals [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, the state is properly normalized now. The probabilities for measuring up and down in the z-basis would be the square of the magnitudes of their coefficients. But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of another operator. Oh, right, the operator with matrix elements A_ij given as hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm.

Wait, the operator's matrix representation is such that the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would look like:
[ 0   hbar/2
  hbar/2 0 ]

What does this operator represent? I'm trying to think. Oh, the spin-x operator, perhaps? Because for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. Let me recall: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the spin operator S_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So yes, that matches. So the operator in question is S_x,
