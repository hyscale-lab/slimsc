Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A to D, each with a series of steps. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. Let me draw its structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering might matter here. Let me see: the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro (NO2) at position 3. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions of the benzene ring, which would make them meta to each other? Or maybe it's a different arrangement.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro are all in the ortho and para positions relative to each other. Hmm, but how can that happen? Because substituents are added in specific orders, and each step would require directing the next substitution.

Wait, the molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So I think the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So positions 1, 2, 3 all have substituents, meaning the benzene ring has three substituents in a row.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the order of substituent addition. Each substitution affects where the next substituent goes because of the directing effects of the substituents.

Let me think about the directing effects of each group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing. tert-butyl is an activating, since it's an alkyl group, which is ortho/para-directing.

But wait, the order of substitution matters a lot. The first substituent will direct where the next goes, then the third will be directed based on the previous two.

So the target
