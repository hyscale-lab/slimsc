Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H₃PO₄: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Orthophosphate ion is PO₄³−, I think. So, I need to find [PO₄³−].

First, I'll probably need to find out how much each of these salts contributes to the phosphate species in the solution. Both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄ are phosphate salts, so they'll dissociate in water. 

Let me calculate the moles of each first.

For KH₂PO₄: moles = mass / molecular weight. So, 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 moles. Hmm, wait, 1 divided by 136 is about 0.00735? Let me calculate more accurately. 136.09 is approximately 136.1, so 1/136.1 ≈ 0.007331 mol. So around 0.00733 moles.

For Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O: the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol. Let me compute 1 divided by 177.99. Let me see, 177.99 is about 178. So 1/178 is approx 0.005618, so 0.005618 mol.

So, each of these salts will dissociate in solution. Let's see:

KH₂PO₄ is K+ and H₂PO₄⁻. So for each mole of KH₂PO₄, we get 1 mole of H₂PO₄⁻.

Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O: when it dissociates, it gives Na+ and HPO₄²−. So each mole of Na₂HPO₄ gives one mole of HPO₄²−.

Wait, wait. Wait, Na₂HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. So, when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO₄²−. So for each mole of Na₂HPO4, we have one mole of HPO₄²−.

So, the solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO4 and HPO₄²− from Na₂HPO4. 

But how does this relate to the orthophosphate ions, PO₄³−? Hmm. Because HPO₄²− can act as a base or an acid. Let me think about the phosphate equilibria.

I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The three dissociation steps are:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4⁻ (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4⁻ ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, the orthophosphate ion is the conjugate base of HPO4^2−. So, in solution, HPO4^2− can either donate a proton (to become PO4^3−) or accept a proton (to become H2PO4^-).

But wait, if I have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2− in solution, which is the case here, I need to consider the equilibrium between them. Because they can interconvert.

So, let's think about the situation in the solution. We have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2−. These two can react:

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2− (this is the reverse of the second dissociation; the equilibrium constant would be K2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8)

Wait, but wait, when H
