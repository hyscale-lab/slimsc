Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me write down what I understand and then think through each part.

The question is about a series of reactions leading to the identification of compound D. Let's break it down.

First, compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, the other a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means two neighboring Hs, and a quartet means three neighboring Hs. 

The 0.9 ppm triplet for 6H makes me think of a methyl group attached to something that causes splitting. Wait, diethyl might be a possibility. Like two ethyl groups. Because each ethyl group has a CH2CH3. The CH3 would be a triplet because the adjacent CH2 has two Hs, right? So for each CH3, it's a triplet. Since A has 6H as a triplet, maybe two methyl groups each with three Hs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, each CH3 would show up as a triplet if next to a CH2. So if there are two CH2 groups adjacent, that would require perhaps a structure like (CH2CH3)2 something. So, maybe A is diethyl something. Like diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O, but then the O would cause splitting differently. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's neopentane? No, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. No, because in that case, the neighboring Hs would be on the same carbon, so maybe not.

Wait, think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. If it's a triplet, each of those 6H must be next to a CH2. So each CH3 is next to a CH2. So maybe two CH2CH3 groups attached to a central carbon. Like diethyl ether: O(CH2CH3)2. But wait, in diethyl ether, the O is connected to two CH2CH3 groups. The CH3 in each ethyl group would be next to a CH2. So each CH3 would be a triplet. And the CH2s would be a quartet. So looking at the NMR, the triplet for CH3 would integrate to 6H (each CH3 has 3H, two of them, 6 total). The quartet at 1.3 ppm would be the CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two Hs, but wait, in diethyl ether, each CH2 is adjacent to the O and another CH2. Wait, the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The CH2 groups adjacent to O would have neighboring Hs. So the CH2 groups in diethyl ether are each attached to O and a CH2CH3. So their protons would be split into a quartet. Because each CH2 is next to the O and has two adjacent CH2 groups? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Each CH2 in the ethyl group in diethyl ether is next to another CH2. So for
