Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum field theory, but I'll try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, right? Which for electromagnetism would be something like ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants, I think. Because if the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory might not be renormalizable. Or is it the other way around?

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian and set them equal since the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions (as it's the integral over d^4x).

Wait, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down L_int: κ times ψ̄ times σ_{μν} times ψ times F^{μν}.

Each of these factors has a certain mass dimension. I need to find each component's dimension and set the total to 4.

First, ψ is a spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor field ψ is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the fields have dimensions [ψ]_M = 3/2. So ψ̄ (the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For a gauge field like electromagnetism, which is a vector field, the field tensor F has dimension equal to the gauge field A. The gauge field A has dimension 1. But wait, F is derivatives of A, right? Because F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. The derivative ∂ has mass dimension 1. So each derivative acting on A (which is dimension 1) gives F a dimension of 1 +1 = 2. So [F]_M = 2.

Now σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices, so the commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} has mass dimension 0.

Putting it all together: the product ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

The dimensions would be [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F].

Which is (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. [ψ̄] is 3/2, σ is 0, [ψ] is 3/2, [F] is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, no. Wait, because when you multiply the dimensions, you add their exponents. So:

3/2 (ψ̄) + 0 (σ) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, plus 2 gives 5. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has mass dimension 5.

But the Lagrangian term is κ times that, and the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the entire term κ * (dimension 5) must be dimension 4. So [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ] =4-5 = -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now for renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ (4 - [vertices]). Wait, more precisely, in four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (sum of dimensions of fields at the vertex). For each vertex, if the coupling has [κ]_M = -1, then it's negative, implying that the dimension of the coupling is negative. So when you have a vertex with coupling κ, the dimension is negative, which would make D positive. That would imply that the Feynman diagrams would have a superficial degree of divergence D positive, meaning the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The superficial degree of divergence D is calculated as D = 4L - (sum of dimensions of vertices) - (sum of dimensions of propagators)*I, where L is the number of loops, I the number of internal lines. Or maybe another formula. Alternatively, for each vertex, if the coupling has dimension [g]_M, then each vertex contributes + [g]_M. Wait, no, I might be getting confused.

Wait, the general formula for superficial degree of divergence in a theory is D = d L - (sum over vertices of (d - [g_i])) ), where d is the spacetime dimension, and [g_i] is the mass dimension of the coupling at vertex i. Or perhaps it's D = d - (sum (d - [g_i])) for each vertex. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: in four dimensions, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - V ([g]_M + (sum of fields at vertex contributing to the divergence)). Hmm, perhaps another way.

Wait, I think the formula is D = 4 - (sum over each vertex (n_i [g_i]_M)), where n_i is the number of vertices of type i. Or maybe D = 4 - (sum [g]_M for each vertex). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I know that for a term in the Lagrangian, each term is of the form g φ^m, where g is the coupling. The dimension of the coupling [g] is [g]_M = d - m*( [φ]_M ), where d is 4 in this case. So for a renormalizable theory, [g]_M must be ≥ 0 because m*( [φ] ) ≤ d → [g]_M ≥ 0.

Wait, for the term in the Lagrangian to have dimension 4, each term must satisfy [g]_M + m * [φ]_M =4.

In this case, our Lagrangian term is L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So it's an interaction term with coupling κ, and the product of fields is ψ̄ ψ F. Let's find the mass dimension of each field in the term.

ψ̄ ψ has (3/2) + (3/2) =3. F has dimension 2. So the product ψ̄ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 =5. So the term κ ψ̄σψ F is dimension [κ] +5. But since L must have dimension 4, [κ] =4-5 = -1, as I found earlier.

Now, for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥0. Because if [g]_M <0, then the interaction term would have a higher dimension (since g is negative), which would make the theory non-renormalizable. Because in higher dimensions, loops can give more divergences, making the theory not renormalizable.

In this case, [κ]_M =-1 <0, so the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together, κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options:

Option C: [κ] = -1, theory not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ] = -1, theory renormalizable. No.

Options B and D have [κ]=1, which is not correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \) and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \), and so does its adjoint \( \bar{\psi} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( [F]_M = 2 \), as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field \( A^\mu \) (which has dimension 1).
- The commutator \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless (\( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0 \)) since it involves only the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. The term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) contributes to the Lagrangian, so the total dimension of this term must also be 4. Breaking it down:
\[
[\kappa]_M + [\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimensions:
\[
[\kappa]_M + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \).

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions (\( [\kappa]_M \geq 0 \)). In this case, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the interaction term has a higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** Incorrect: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), but the theory is not renormalizable.
- **B)** Incorrect: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), which is not consistent with the calculation.
- **C)** Correct: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **D)** Incorrect: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), which is not consistent with the calculation.
