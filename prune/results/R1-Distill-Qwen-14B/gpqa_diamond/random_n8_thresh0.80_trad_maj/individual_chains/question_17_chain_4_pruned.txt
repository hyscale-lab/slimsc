Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

The options are A to D. Alright, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and it's a 1:1 ratio since it's stoichiometric.

So, the formation constant, K, is given by K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, EDTA can exist in different protonated forms, right? Oh wait, the problem says pH is ideal. I think that means we can assume that the EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, Y^4-, so the concentration of Y^4- is the same as the free EDTA concentration.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the initial concentrations before dissociation are [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both 0, but that's not right because the complex would dissociate.

Wait, no. The complex is already formed, so the solution is in equilibrium. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the K value. So the equilibrium expression would be K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, that's the formation constant for the complex. Alternatively, sometimes K is given as the association constant, which would be the same as the formation constant. So if the complex dissociates, the K is very large, meaning the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Given that
