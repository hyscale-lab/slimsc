Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me start by breaking down what's given and what I remember about each reaction.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, pretty rigid. So dibrominating it at the 1 and 3 positions would mean the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction here. Dehydrohalogenation, which would form an alkene. Since there are two bromines, maybe it's a di-elimination. Wait, or is it a vicinal dihalide that undergoes elimination to form an alkyne? Wait, no, because dehydrohalogenation typically forms alkenes. Oh wait, but if it's two adjacent bromines, when KOH is in excess, maybe it's a double elimination. So, two molecules of HBr would be removed, and we get an alkyne? Because two eliminations would take away two H's, forming a triple bond.

So the product 1 would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane or something like that. Wait, but wait, when you have vicinal dihalides, like 1,2-dibromoethane, eliminating with KOH gives ethene. But for adamantane, where the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, perhaps forming a triple bond? Because each elimination would remove a Br and a H from adjacent carbons. So, two eliminations would form a triple bond. So product 1 is 1,3-didehydroadamantane, which is an alkyne within the adamantane structure. So, it's an adamantine alkyne.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H, probably the alkyne protons since they are upfield, but wait, no, alkyne protons are usually around 2-3 ppm. Hmm. Wait, 4.79 is more like an alcohol or maybe an ether, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when a dihalide (like vicinal) reacts with KOH, maybe it undergoes a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But in which case, the product would be an alkene. So, perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Let's think about the NMR.

The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That area is usually for protons adjacent to oxygen, like in an ether or an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereotopic proton in a cyclic structure. Wait, but if it's an alkene, the protons would be around 5-6 ppm. So 4.79 doesn't fit that. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides would have higher ppm for the protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination to form an alcohol? No, that's unlikely. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another angle: the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a ketone group. Oh, wait! So the reaction is not elimination but perhaps a substitution. But wait, in a dihalide, if both bromines are replaced by something, like hydroxyl groups, but that would require a substitution. But in KOH, perhaps the bromide ions are leaving, and something else comes in.

Wait, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkyne, but that doesn't involve oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by hydroxyl groups. But then two hydroxyls would be present. But the IR would show O-H stretches around 3200-3600 cm-1, which isn't mentioned. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, considering the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a ketone. Then, how do we get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Oh wait, perhaps it's an example of a pinacol rearrangement? No, pinacol rearrangement is when a vicinal diol loses water to form a carbonyl, but here we have dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination? No, that's for esters. Hmm.

Alternative approach: dibromide plus KOH could form a ketone. How? Maybe via a double substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but I don't think that leads to a ketone. Or perhaps via a different reaction mechanism.

Wait, another reaction comes to mind. If you have a dihalide and you treat it with a strong base like KOH, you can get a coupling reaction. Like the formation of a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm not recalling that mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: When a vicinal dihalide is treated with a base, it can undergo an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but I thought elimination typically forms alkenes or alkynes, not carbonyls. Unless it's a special case.

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but that's usually for amines. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a triple bond, but then the product has a triple bond, not a carbonyl. So the NMR doesn't fit that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't formed via elimination but via substitution. Let me think: KOH has hydroxide ions. So if each Br is replaced by an O- group, but then perhaps a dehydration occurs. Wait, but that would form an epoxide, which we don't see in the IR.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted into a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl in IR.

Wait, perhaps the heating with KOH under certain conditions causes a pericyclic reaction, but I can't think of any that directly forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: What if the dihalide is treated with KOH, and each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but then the diol undergoes some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if the diol (vicinal diol) would lose two water molecules via elimination, but that would form an alkene again. Unless it's in a cyclic structure where elimination leads to ring contraction and forms a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the structure of adamantane.Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons.

If the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group, forming 1,3-diol. Then, under the reaction conditions, perhaps this diol undergoes a ring-opening or some kind of elimination.

Wait, but if the diol is vicinal, then the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH might lead to elimination of water, forming a carbonyl. Wait, that's the pinacol rearrangement! But pinacol rearrangement involves a vicinal diol losing two water molecules to form a carbonyl. But wait, pinacol rearrangement requires the diol to be in a 1,2-diol arrangement. But wait in pinacol, the diol is on adjacent carbons and when they lose two water molecules, a carbonyl is formed, along with a shift of a bond.

But wait, in the pinacol rearrangement, the diol is in a certain structure where elimination leads to a carbonyl. So if product 1 is a ketone, maybe that's what's happening here.

But wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon treatment with KOH would give 1,3-diol. But in pinacol, the diol is 1,2-diol. So perhaps that's not applicable here.

Wait, another thought
