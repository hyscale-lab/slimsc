Alright, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? Like when molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them chiral. So I need to look at each compound and see if they have any chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, so I'll go through each one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Okay, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism, especially if there are substituents in certain positions. The substituents here are nitro groups at positions 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, biphenyls can have what's called "dihedral angles", and if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, maybe they can cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are in a way that makes the molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomers.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Biphenyl with substituents on each ring. For the molecule to be chiral, it should lack a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are on the same side or opposite, maybe. So 6 and 6' are nitro groups. Are those in positions that might create chirality? If the substituents on each ring are in positions such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if there's a center of chirality or an axial chirality (like in biphenyls), that could cause it.

Wait, another thought: biphenyl compounds can exhibit cis-trans isomerism. But optical isomerism is about asymmetry. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, then yes. But wait, if the substituents are in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral.

Looking at the structure: 6 and 6' are both nitro, and 2 and 2' are both methyl esters of carboxylic acids. Wait, no, the compound is a dimethyl est
