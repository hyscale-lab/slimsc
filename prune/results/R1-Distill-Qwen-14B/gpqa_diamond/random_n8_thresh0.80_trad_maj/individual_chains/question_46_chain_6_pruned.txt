Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with numbers 4,8,6,2.

First off, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene groups. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhenium or ruthenium based, and it's used for ring-closing metathesis and cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, does the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center? Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2 something? Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl means a methyl branch on the third carbon. So numbering from the double bond, for pent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, pentane is five carbons. So 1-pentene is CH2=CHCH2
