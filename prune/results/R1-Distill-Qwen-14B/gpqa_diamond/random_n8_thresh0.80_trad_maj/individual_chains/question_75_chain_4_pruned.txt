Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break down what's happening here.

The setup is that the researcher introduced a GADD45G coding sequence into a plasmid, adding an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence, I need to see if there's anything wrong that would prevent expression. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be right after the start.

Wait, but I should check for potential stop codons that might terminate translation early. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, or UGA. These are signals for the ribosome to stop translating the mRNA into protein.

Looking through the provided DNA sequence, which is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. Let me scan for sequences that would become stop codons in the mRNA.

Let's find the start codon first. The sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. The next codons are TAC, which in mRNA would be AUG (since DNA is complementary). Wait, no, wait: Wait, the DNA is the plus strand, so the mRNA is synthesized from the complementary minus strand. So the mRNA is the same as the plus strand except T is replaced with U.

So the mRNA would start with ATG (from the plus DNA strand), but wait no: Wait, DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand has ATG, so the mRNA is synthesized from the complementary minus strand, which would be ATC... wait, no, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the DNA is plus strand, which is the same as mRNA except T→U. So the mRNA sequence is the same as the plus DNA strand, but with U instead of T. So the mRNA would start with ATG.

Wait, no, wait. The plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand, which is complementary to the plus. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand but with U instead of T. So the mRNA's sequence is exactly the same as the plus DNA except for T→U.

So in the plus DNA strand, the first few codons are ATG, TAC, CCA, etc. So the mRNA sequence would be A U G, U A C, C C A, etc.

Wait, but wait: The mRNA codons are read from the template (minus) strand, so the mRNA codons are complementary to the DNA plus strand. So, if the DNA plus strand is 5' ATG TAC ... then the template strand is 3' TAC ... complementary. So the mRNA is built as A U G (from TAC on the template), so the mRNA starts AUG, which is methionine, correct.

So the first few codons in DNA plus are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), etc. So in mRNA, that's AUG, UAC, CCA, etc.

Wait, but I'm looking for stop codons in the mRNA. So the mRNA would have sequences that could form UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking through the DNA plus strand sequence:
