Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. Oh right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation levels are described by the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation, I think, is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k times temperature). So the formula is like N2/N1 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, we have two stars. For star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So if I denote the excitation as something like the population of the higher energy level, then for star 1, N_upper1 / N_lower1 = 2 * (N_upper2 / N_lower2). Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of excitation, so maybe N_upper1 / N_lower1 = 2 * (N_upper2 / N_lower2). Or perhaps it's the other way around, because if star_1's atoms are twice as excited, maybe their ratio is higher. I'm not sure about the exact wording, but let's proceed.

The energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE is equal to k_B * something. Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is about the same as k_B (since k is ~1.38e-23 J/K). Interesting, maybe that's a clue.

So, according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But wait, I think in the standard form, it's the ratio of the upper level to the lower level. So if the energy is higher, the population is lower. Let me get this right. The ratio is N_upper / N_lower = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ). Since E_upper > E_lower, the exponent is negative, so the ratio is less than one. But in this problem, star 1's excitation is higher, so the ratio N_upper1 / N_lower1 is higher than that of star 2.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So, perhaps the population in the excited state is higher. So let's let x be the ratio for star_1 (N_upper1/N_lower1) and y be that for star_2. Then according to the problem, x = 2y.

Alternatively, maybe it's the fraction in the upper level that's twice as much. Either way, the key is to relate the
