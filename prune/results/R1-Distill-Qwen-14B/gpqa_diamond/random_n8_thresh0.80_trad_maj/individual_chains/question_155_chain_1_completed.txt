Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again carefully.

The problem talks about an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which makes sense because usually, when we talk about eigenstates, we pick a basis that aligns with one of the operators, often the easiest one, like Pz here.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We're asked to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

So, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. The formula is ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩², where ⟨A⟩ is the expectation value of the operator A.

First, I need to find the expectation value of Pz, ⟨Pz⟩, and the expectation value of Pz squared, ⟨Pz²⟩. Then, plug those into the formula to get the uncertainty.

Let me write out the state vector. It's a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Wait, but wait. I think I should double-check the dimensions. Each component is a scalar, so this is a 3x1 vector, which makes sense if Pz is a 3x3 matrix.

Next, the matrix of Pz is given as:

Pz =
[ ħ     0      0     ]
[ 0     0      0     ]
[ 0     0    -ħ     ]

Wait, actually, looking back, the rows are first, second, third. So the matrix is:

First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the matrix form of P_z has components in the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second as (0,0,0), third as (0,0,-ħ). So, yes, that's correct.

So, the Pz matrix is diagonal, which is why the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So each basis vector corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz. The eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the respective rows.

So, the state ψ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Wait, but in the given state ψ, the components are in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors. So the state is expressed as a combination of |+z>, |0z>, and |-z>, I suppose.

But wait, the state is in the eigenstate of Px, which is a different basis. Hmm. No, wait. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state ψ is written in the eigenbasis of Pz, which might not be the same as the eigenbasis of Px.

Wait, no, when the basis is given as the eigenvectors of Pz, that suggests that the state is expressed in that basis. So ψ is a vector in the Pz eigenbasis.

So, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value, we can compute ψ† Pz ψ. Because Pz is diagonal in this basis, so maybe that's easier.

Alternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenvalue. Let's think: The first component is -1/2, which would correspond to ħ * (-1/2) for Pz? Wait, no, wait. The state is ψ = [a, b, c]^T, so the expectation value is a* ħ a + b* (0) b + c* (-ħ) c. Because the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ.

Wait, no, no. The expectation value is the sum of the components squared multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because each component is the amplitude for each eigenstate.

So, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Let me calculate that.

a = -1/2 → |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
b = 1/sqrt(2) → |b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
c = -1/2 → |c|^2 = 1/4

So, ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) 
= ( (1/4 - 1/4) ) ħ
= 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, the expectation value of Pz squared, ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared would have the squares of the diagonal elements. So the matrix Pz² would be:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So, the expectation value is a* ħ² a + b* *0* b + c* ħ² c.

Which is ħ² (|a|^2 + |c|^2).

We already have |a|^2 and |c|^2 as 1/4 each. So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ² (1/4 + 1/4) = ħ² (1/2).

So, putting it together:

ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² )

But since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩) = sqrt( ħ² (1/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach: since Pz is diagonal in the basis, the calculation is straightforward. Yeah, because the state is already in the eigenbasis of Pz, so the calculation is simple.

Wait, but wait a second. The state is given as an eigenstate of Px, but that doesn't affect the calculation of ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩, because we're in the Pz eigenbasis. So regardless of what operator the state is an eigenstate of, in this basis, we can compute the expectation values as described.

So, the uncertainty ΔPz should be sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

So the answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$, $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left| a \right|^2 (\hbar) + \left| b \right|^2 (0) + \left| c \right|^2 (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The probabilities are:

\[
\left| a \right|^2 = \left| c \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \left| b \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} (\hbar) + \frac{1}{2} (0) + \frac{1}{4} (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left| a \right|^2 (\hbar^2) + \left| b \right|^2 (0) + \left| c \right|^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} (\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2} (0) + \frac{1}{4} (\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
