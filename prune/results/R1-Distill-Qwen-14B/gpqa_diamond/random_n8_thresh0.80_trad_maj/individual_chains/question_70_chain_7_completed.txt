Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, okay. Let me break down the information given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, that's A + 8B → C. I'm thinking about what reactions involve such stoichiometry. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something, but wait, sulfur is bright red as an elemental form? Or perhaps a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide. Or perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where B is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or Cl2.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. E is dangerous, so maybe a toxic gas like SO2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps E is a product like phosgene or another industrial chemical.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to form A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, when C is hydrated, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is something like H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO2 (weak), but that depends on the reaction.

Wait, when you have a reaction with water yielding two acids, perhaps C is a salt that's being hydrolyzed. For example, if C is a sulfite and a nitrite salt? Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, if C is a sulfate, but that might not split into two acids. Hmm.

Fourth statement: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent, so common solvents include water (but B would be H2O then?), ethanol, ether... Wait, if D and B are gases, their reaction product is a solvent. So, for example, if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, they react to form NH2Cl, but that's not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2S? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another angle. Maybe D is a halogen and B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something that combines with O to form a solvent. Wait, B is a gas. Let me think about what two gases could react in a 1:1 ratio to form a common solvent. Hmm. If B is CO2 and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about H. It's a solvent, so maybe H2O? But how would that form from D and B? Alternatively, perhaps H is something like ethanol, but how would ethanol form from two gases? Maybe if D is CH3CH2X and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: D and B could be NH3 and something else. Or perhaps D is H2O and B is something else, but that wouldn't make sense because H2O is a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (a weak acid) and another strong acid. Or perhaps C is a nitride, but that might not split into two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like CaCO3, but that doesn't split into acids. Wait, maybe C is a sulfate, but when it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions. If C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G, then perhaps C is something like a sulfite or something else. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water would produce 2NaOH (A?), H2SO3 (which is H2S O3, but that's unstable and would break down further, perhaps). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is FeS (solid), B is O2 (gas), then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with FeS would produce FeO (but that doesn't fit the stoichiometry). Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of SO3 from S and O2. Wait, sulfur (solid) and O2 (gas) reacting to form SO3? Not exactly, because S + O2 forms SO2, but that's gaseous. Or maybe the first reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur (solid S), and B is O2. Then, S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But SO3 is a liquid, I think. Alternatively, if A is S8, the form of elemental sulfur, and B is O2, then S8 + 8O2 → 8SO2. But in that case, C would be SO2. Then, reacting C with D would involve SO2 plus 2D to form E. Also, C (SO2) reacting with water would produce H2SO3 (a weak acid) and another acid? Wait, no, SO2 + H2O → H2SO3, which is a weak acid. But the problem says two different acids, F and G. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt, like a sulfate or sulfite, which when hydrolyzed gives two acids.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitrate. Let's say C is NaNO3, and reacting with water would produce NaOH (a strong base, so that would be A?), but wait, F and G are acids, so maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like CaCO3, but that doesn't split into acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate or something else.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate, but upon hydrolysis, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, but carbonates usually hydrolyze to form a strong base and CO2 (which is an acid, but it's a weak acid). For example, CaCO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + CO2. So, Ca(OH)2 is a strong base (but F and G are acids). Hmm, that doesn't fit because F and G are acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 (strong base) + NH3 (which is a weak base, not an acid). So that's not right either.

Wait, let's think about the reaction when C is SO3. Then, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. But that's only one acid. So that doesn't fit the description of two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, something that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. Like maybe a sulfite and another group. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chlorate or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is HCl (strong) and G is HNO2 (weak). Then, C might be something like NaClNO2, which when hydrolyzed would produce NaOH (A), HCl, and HNO2. Wait, but what would C be in that case? That's an example, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider the other reactions. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is a common solvent, perhaps H is water? Then, D and B would have to react to form H2O. So, for example, D is H2O and B is something else, but that can't be because H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and B is O2, but then they would form H2O, which is a solvent. That's a possibility.

Wait, if D is H2 and B is O2, then their reaction would produce H2O. But H2 and O2 react in a 1:1 ratio (2H2 + O2 → 2H2O), but that's not 1:1. It's 2:1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: if D is NH3 (a gas) and B is HCl (gas), then D + B → NH4Cl (which is a solid, not a solvent). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is ethanol. Then, how would D and B react to form ethanol? That would require D and B to be something like ethylene oxide and water, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like ether, but I don't know.

Wait, maybe D is Cl2 and B is CH4. Then, D + B → CCl4, but that's a solvent and is a product, but the reaction would need CH4 and Cl2 in some ratio. Not sure.

Another angle: perhaps D is a diatomic gas. Let's think about which diatomic gases can react with another diatomic gas in a 1:1 ratio to form a common solvent. Oh! Maybe D is H2 and B is Cl2. Then, H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl. Then, NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid. So that's not a solvent either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's try to figure out what E is, since the question is about its molecular symmetry.

E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. Also, E is extremely hazardous. So, what are some extremely hazardous compounds? Phosgene (COCl2) is very toxic. Or perhaps something like sarin gas, but that's more of a nerve agent. Alternatively, HCN is very toxic but is a gas. But let's think about E's structure.

Wait, if C is SO2 and D is Cl2, then SO2 + 2Cl2 → SOCl2 (which is phosgene, I think). Phosgene is a toxic gas. So E would be phosgene, which has the formula OCl2C. Wait, no, phosgene is Cl2C=O. Wait, no, phosgene is (Cl)2C=O, so the structure is O=C(Cl)2. So, the molecule is planar, with a trigonal planar geometry around the carbon, but since it's a double bond, the molecule has a certain symmetry.

Wait, what's the symmetry of phosgene? Let me think. The molecule is Cl-CO-Cl. The central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, the molecule has a structure where the two Cl atoms are on opposite sides of the carbonyl group. So, the molecule would be linear, with the two Cl atoms on either side. So, the symmetry group would be D∞h, but wait, no. Wait, the molecule is O=C(Cl)2, so it's a linear molecule with two identical substituents on either side of the central C=O. So the molecule has a center of inversion, and mirror planes. So, the symmetry group is D∞h? Or maybe it's D2h.

Wait, another way: the molecule is linear, so it has a center of inversion and a principal axis of order 2 (C2). It also has two mirror planes. Hmm, the symmetry group for a molecule like phosgene would be D2h. Alternatively, maybe D∞h? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Phosgene is a linear molecule: O=C(Cl)2. So, each Cl is on either end. The molecule has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation), and two mirror planes. The point group would be D2h. But wait, the options given are D4h, D∞h, C2v, and C2.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2. No, because E is formed from C and D, which would be other reactants.

Wait, another possibility: E could be O3 (ozone), but that's a triatomic molecule. Ozone has a bent structure and belongs to the C2v point group. But is O3 extremely hazardous? I think it's toxic, so that could be a possibility.

Wait, but if E is O3, then looking at its structure, it's a V-shaped molecule with a central O, and two O atoms attached. The symmetry is C2v. So the point group is C2v, which is option D.

But let me see if that fits the other clues.

If E is O3, then what about the other reactions?

C reacts with 2D to form E. So, C + 2D → O3.

D is a gas, so what could D be? If E is O3, then perhaps D is O2. So, C + 2O2 → O3. That seems a bit unlikely, but let's see.

Wait, but O3 is formed from O2 under certain conditions, like electrolysis or UV light. So, perhaps C is O2, but then what would A be?

Wait, going back to the first reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. If C is O3, then A + 8B → O3. That's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps A is O2, B is something else, but this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let me think again.

Another possibility: if C is SO2, and D is Cl2, then SO2 + 2Cl2 → SOCl2 (thionyl chloride). But I'm not sure if that's E. Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2Cl2, which is phosgene. Wait, no, phosgene is Cl2C=O, which is another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is a linear molecule. HCN has a structure where H is bonded to C, which is bonded to N. The molecule is linear, so it has a center of inversion and a C2 axis, with two mirror planes. Its point group would be D∞h? Or maybe D2h.

Wait, another way to approach this: think about the point groups of the options. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

D4h is a point group with a four-fold principal axis and horizontal mirror planes. D∞h has an infinite-fold principal axis, like in a linear molecule with high symmetry, like O2 or CO2. C2v has a two-fold principal axis and two vertical mirror planes. C2 would have a two-fold rotation axis, no mirror planes.

So, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and mirror planes, its point group would be D∞h.

Wait, what's the structure of phosgene again? It's Cl-CO-Cl, which is O=C(Cl)2. So, it's a linear molecule with two Cl atoms opposite each other. So, the symmetry group should be D∞h because it's linear, has a C∞ axis, and has mirror planes perpendicular to the axis. Wait, no, actually, D∞h is the point group for linear molecules with a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the main axis.

Wait, but for a molecule like phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2, do the mirror planes exist? It's a planar molecule, but each Cl is on opposite ends, so perhaps it's linear. So, the point group should be D∞h.

Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetric with a center of inversion and mirror planes, then yes, D∞h is correct.

Wait, another way: D∞h is the point group for O2 and similar linear molecules. So, if E is O2, but that doesn't fit the extremely hazardous description unless it's O2 in some reactive form, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, if E is CO2, which is a linear molecule. CO2 is non-toxic, but the question says E is extremely hazardous. So that probably isn't it.

Wait, another dangerous gas: HCN is highly toxic. Its structure is H-C≡N, which is linear. So, the point group for HCN is D∞h.

Wait, no, HCN is a linear molecule with a C≡N group. So, the structure is H–C≡N. So, the molecule is linear, so the point group is D∞h.

Wait, but in that case, E would be HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.

But let's see if that fits the reactions.

If E is HCN, then C (from the first reaction) reacts with D (another gas) in a 2:1 ratio to form HCN. So, C + 2D → HCN.

What would C and D be in that case? Let's think.

If C is (for example) a cyanide salt, but that's not matching the earlier reactions.

Alternatively, if C is a nitrile, but that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, and when it reacts with D (which is something like H2O or another gas), it produces HCN. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's consider what F and G are. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it produces A (maybe a base?), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

If F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 (weak), then when C reacts with water, it produces HCl and H2SO3. Then, what is C? Perhaps it's something like CSO2Cl? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite and a chlorite salt. Wait, if C is NaClSO3, then upon hydrolysis, it might produce HCl and H2SO3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Wait, if C is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), then reacting with water would produce 2NaOH and CO2. But NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed carbonate, like NaHCO3. Then, hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H2CO3 (which is a weak acid). But then F would be NaOH, which is a strong base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a nitrate, like NaNO3, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH and HNO3. But HNO3 is a strong acid. Then, where's the weak acid? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like RSO3H, but that's an acid itself.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate. If C is KClO3, then reacting with water might not produce acids, but perhaps under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is SO3, then reacting with water produces H2SO4 (strong acid) and another acid? No, it just produces H2SO4, so that's only one acid.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a dimer or a complex that upon hydrolysis releases two acids. For example, if C is a double salt like Ca(ClO)Cl, which upon hydrolysis might produce HCl (strong) and HClO (weak acid). But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a diacid salt, like NaHPO4. Then, hydrolysis might produce H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- which are weak acids. But that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, like FeS. Reacting FeS with water doesn't produce strong and weak acids; FeS is a solid that reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)2 (which is a weak base) and H2S (a weak acid). So in this case, F and G would be H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (a base), which doesn't fit the description of two acids.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to focus on the structure of E and its symmetry. Since E is a product of C and D, and it's extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a compound like phosgene (Cl2C=O), which is a dangerous industrial chemical. So, if E is phosgene, its structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is a linear molecule with Cl atoms on either end of the carbonyl group.

So, the molecule is O=C(Cl)2, which is linear. So, it has a C∞ axis (infinite-fold), and two mirror planes. The point group for such a molecule would be D∞h.

Wait, but D∞h has a principal axis of infinite order, and also has horizontal mirror planes. In the case of phosgene, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Or is it just a central inversion?

Phosgene is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, which would make it belong to the D∞h point group. Because D∞h includes a principal axis, a center of inversion, and mirror planes.

So, if E is phosgene (Cl2C=O), then its symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought E could be HCN, which also has D∞h symmetry. So both possibilities would fit. But I need to see which one aligns better with the other reactions.

Let's think about D and B reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If D is Cl2 and B is CO, then H could be something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: if D is H2O and B is something else. But H is a solvent, so maybe H is H2O. But then D and B would have to react to form H2O. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2S and B is O2. Then, H2S + O2 → H2O (but not in a 1:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit).

Wait, perhaps D is H2O and B is NH3. Then, their reaction would form something, but not a solvent in a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is SO2. Then, SO2 + NH3 → NH4HSO3, which is a salt and not a solvent.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to E's structure. If E is phosgene (Cl2C=O), which has D∞h symmetry, that would be option C. Another possibility is O3, which has C2v symmetry (option D).

So, which of these is more likely? Let's think about the first reaction. If A is C and B is Cl2, but wait, in the first reaction, A is solid and B is gas. When A reacts with 8 equivalents of B, forms C.

Wait, maybe A is carbon (solid), B is Cl2. Then, 8Cl2 + C → CCl2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps A is C and B is O2. Then, 8O2 + C → CO (but that's not right, as typically C + O2 → CO2).

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, like Fe, and B is Cl2. Then, 8Cl2 + Fe → FeCl4? But FeCl4 is a solid, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, maybe A is Na, B is Cl2. Then, 2Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's 1:1. The first reaction is 1A +8B → C. So that's 1:8 stoichiometry. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur (S8), and B is O2. Then, the reaction would be S8 +8O2 → 8SO2. That fits the 1:8 ratio. So C would be SO2.

Then, C (SO2) reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So, SO2 + 2D → E. What could D be?

If E is SOCl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a toxic gas. Then, D would be Cl2. So, SO2 + 2Cl2 → SOCl2 + Cl2? Wait, no, the reaction would be SO2 + 2Cl2 → SOCl2 + Cl2? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2, so SO2 + 2Cl2 → SO2Cl2 (which is phosgene, Cl2C=O). Wait, but that would require the correct stoichiometry.

Wait, so SO2 + 2Cl2 → SO2Cl2. I think that's correct. So, E would be SO2Cl2, which is phosgene. Phosgene is a toxic gas with the structure O=C(Cl)2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Then, looking at the third reaction: C (SO2) reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So, SO2 + H2O → H2SO3 (which is H2S O3, but that's unstable and tends to break down into H+ and HSO3^- in solution). Wait, but the problem states that F and G are two different acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. If C is SO2Cl2, which is E, but wait, no, E is the product of C and D. Let me re-express the steps:

First reaction: A + 8B → C → SO2 (if A is S8 and B is O2).

Second reaction: C (SO2) + 2D → E. If D is Cl2, then E is SO2Cl2 (phosgene).

Third reaction: C (SO2) + H2O → A + F + G. So, SO2 + H2O → H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid. So, in this case, F and G would both be H2SO3, which are the same, but the problem states they're different acids. That doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, B is Cl2. Then, Fe + 8Cl2 → FeCl4? Not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps A is FeO, B is Cl2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to think of another approach.

If C is SO3, then reacting with H2O produces H2SO4 (strong acid) and another acid? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is Na2CO3, and H2O produces NaOH and CO2. But again, NaOH is a strong base, not an acid.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonamide or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For example, if A is Al, B is Cl2. Then, 2Al + 3Cl2 → AlCl3. But that's 2:3, not 1:8.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, A is Na2O, B is Cl2. Then, Na2O + Cl2 → NaCl. But the stoichiometry would be 1:1, not 1:8.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Maybe I should focus on the point groups of the options and think which ones are possible for E.

Option C is D∞h, which is the point group for linear molecules with high symmetry, like O2, CO2, HCN, etc. So, if E is HCN, its symmetry group would be D∞h.

But earlier, I thought E could be phosgene, which is Cl2C=O, which is also D∞h.

So, perhaps either way, the answer would be D∞h (option C).

Alternatively, if E is O3, which is a bent molecule, its point group is C2v (option D).

But O3 is a bent molecule with a C2v point group. But is O3 extremely hazardous? I think it's toxic but perhaps not as extremely hazardous as phosgene.

Wait, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene is more dangerous than ozone.

So, if E is phosgene (Cl2C=O), then its point group is D∞h (option C).

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option C) D∞h.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E, based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a reaction involving a metal and a diatomic gas, potentially forming a compound like SO₂ (if A is sulfur and B is O₂).

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. If C is SO₂ and D is Cl₂, the reaction could form SOCl₂ (thionyl chloride) or SO₂Cl₂ (phosgene). Phosgene is a highly toxic gas with the structure O=C(Cl)₂, which is linear and symmetric.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is SO₂, it reacts with water to form H₂SO₃ (weak acid). However, this does not perfectly align with the description of two distinct acids, but it is plausible.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is Cl₂, their reaction does not directly form a solvent, but this step is less critical to determining E's symmetry.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:  
   - If E is phosgene (SO₂Cl₂), its structure is O=C(Cl)₂, which is linear with a principal axis (C∞), a center of inversion, and two mirror planes. This corresponds to the point group **D∞h**.  
   - Another possibility is O₃, a bent molecule with point group **C2v**, but O₃ is less consistent with the description of E as "extremely hazardous" compared to phosgene.

Given the extreme hazard of E and the symmetry of phosgene, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
