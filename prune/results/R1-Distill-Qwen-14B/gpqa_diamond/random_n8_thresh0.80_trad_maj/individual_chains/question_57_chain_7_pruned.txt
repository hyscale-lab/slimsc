Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values. The measured phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore any other phase shifts beyond these. The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are numerical with units of fm, which I think stands for femtometers.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The formula for the imaginary part of f(θ) along the direction of the incident beam (θ=0°) is given by something like... Oh right, the expression involves the sum over the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

The general formula for f(θ) in terms of phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ) ]

But since we're looking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, θ is 0°. Let's think about that. When θ is 0, sin(lθ) becomes sin(0) which is zero for all l. Wait, that can't be right because then the entire sum would be zero. But that doesn't make sense because the options are all non-zero.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh, wait, perhaps the imaginary part isn't the same as the entire f(θ). Because f(θ) is a complex quantity. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ) ]

So the real part is when you take the real part of this, and the imaginary part is the imaginary part. But when θ=0, sin(lθ) is zero for all l except l=0, because for l=0, sin(0)=0 as well. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, wait, when l=0, the term is (2*0+1) e^{iδ_0} sin(0θ
