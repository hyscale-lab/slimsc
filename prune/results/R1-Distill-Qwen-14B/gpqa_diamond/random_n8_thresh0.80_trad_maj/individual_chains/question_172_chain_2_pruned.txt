Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, energy levels in atoms relate to temperature through something like the Boltzmann distribution. I remember that the probability of an atom being in a certain energy state depends on the temperature. The formula was something like the ratio of populations being exponential in terms of energy over temperature.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is P = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Since they're talking about the same energy levels but in different stars, I think E_i - E_j would be the same for both stars. Because the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J.

So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let's denote the excitation as n1 and n2. So n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, but in terms of the Boltzmann factor, the ratio of the populations (n1/n2) is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T2) ) ).

Wait no, more accurately, the ratio n1/n2 is [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T2) ) ]? No, wait. Let me get it right.

The Boltzmann equation for the ratio is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this problem, the energy levels are the same for both stars, so E_i - E_j is the same, let's say delta E. So for each star, the ratio of the excitation (n1 and n2) would be governed by their respective temperatures.

Wait, but the problem says the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 n2. Assuming that the ground state is much more populated, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, no, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps n1 is the number
