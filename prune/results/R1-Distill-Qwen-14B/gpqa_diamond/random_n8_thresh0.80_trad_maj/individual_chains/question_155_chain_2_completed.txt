Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Hmm, first, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(<A²> - <A>²). So in this case, I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but the operator P_z is given, right? Let me look at its matrix form. The matrix for P_z has the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), the second row (0,0,0), and the third row (0,0,-ħ). So it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ along the diagonal. That makes sense because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis is |+z>, |0z>, |-z> or something like that.

The state of the system is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, but the basis here is for P_z, meaning the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the state is a linear combination of |+z>, |0z>, and |-z>.

Wait, the state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. But I should check if this state is normalized. Let's compute the sum of squares of the absolute values. So |(-1/2)|² is 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))² is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is 1/4. Summing them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Okay, so it is normalized. Good.

So the state |ψ> is ( -1/2 |+z> + (1/sqrt(2)) |0z> - 1/2 |-z> ). 

Wait, but the problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. Oh, right, because P_x has eigenvalues... wait, I'm not sure about that. But the given state is the explicit form, so perhaps it's an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So that's the state we're working with.

To find ΔP_z, I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z^2>, then take sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²).

Wait, but since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, maybe this will be easier. Because in that case, the expectation values are just the weighted sums of the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think. The state |ψ> is a vector in the P_z eigenbasis. So each component in this vector corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate of P_z. So the first component is the amplitude for |+z> (eigenvalue ħ), the second for |0z> (eigenvalue 0), and the third for |-z> (eigenvalue -ħ).

So the expectation value <P_z> is sum_{i} |a_i|² * λ_i, where a_i are the components of |ψ>, and λ_i are the eigenvalues.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is the sum of |a_i|^2 multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Because each |a_i|^2 is the probability of being in that eigenstate, and when you measure P_z, you get the eigenvalue with that probability. So the average is sum |a_i|^2 * λ_i.

So let's compute that.

The state components are a1 = -1/2, a2 = 1/sqrt(2), a3 = -1/2.

So |a1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |a2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, |a3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Eigenvalues are λ1 = ħ, λ2 = 0, λ3 = -ħ.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ + 0 = 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, for <P_z^2>, it's the expectation of the square of P_z. But since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is the sum of |a_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2.

So:

(1/4)*(ħ^2) + (1/2)*(0^2) + (1/4)*( (-ħ)^2 ) = (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So <P_z²> is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 ). Since <P_z> is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ / sqrt(2)).

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is to compute the matrix elements. Because perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z. Wait, no, the problem says that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is written in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is given in the P_z basis, so the expectation values are as I calculated.

So the uncertainty would be sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking back at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$
The system is in the state given by the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenstates of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$ with weights given by the probabilities $|a_i|^2$, where $a_i$ are the components of $|\psi\rangle$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the first, second, and third basis states, respectively.

The probabilities are:
\[
|a_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |a_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |a_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of $P_z$ is:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, and its eigenvalues are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$ for the first, second, and third basis states, respectively.

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty in $P_z$
The uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
