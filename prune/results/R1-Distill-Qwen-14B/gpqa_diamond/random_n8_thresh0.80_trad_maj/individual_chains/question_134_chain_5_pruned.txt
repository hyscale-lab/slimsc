Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. I remember that for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy change is pretty standard, around -57 kJ/mol for each H+ and OH- reacting. But wait, the problem gives different volumes and concentrations, so I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- first.

Let me break it down. There are three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I'll need to figure out how much H+ comes from the acids and how much OH- comes from the base.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-.

Molarity is moles per liter. So 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) of 0.2 M HCl will have moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid as well, but since it's diprotic, each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So the reaction is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. 

So the moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but the total H+ and OH- might not be equal, so I need to find the limiting reagent. Let's sum up the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The OH- is the limiting reactant because it's less. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with H+.

But wait, how does the neutralization work? Each H+ reacts with an OH- to form water. So each mole of H+ and OH- produces one mole of water, releasing heat.

The total moles of H+ available are 0.28, but only 0.2 moles of OH- are present. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain unreacted. But wait, does that matter for the enthalpy calculation? Because the neutralization is about the reaction that happens, so only 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will combine.

Wait, but wait—the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it dissociates completely, giving two H+ per molecule. So when it reacts with OH-, each H+ from H2SO4 will react with an OH-.

But in this case, the OH- is the limiting reagent. So all of it will react. So each H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react in proportion based on availability.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the equivalents.

For HCl: 0.1 moles of H+ → 0.1 equivalents.

For H2SO4: 0.18 moles → 0.18 equivalents.

For Ba(OH)2: 0.2 equivalents (since each mole gives 2 OH-).

So the total H+ equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- equivalents: 0.2.

So the H+ is in excess. The OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 equivalents of OH- will react.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water.

The enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually given per mole of H+ neutralized, but I think in this case, since we're calculating the total heat, it'll be based on the moles of H+ reacting.

Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid reacting with a base, and for strong acids and strong bases, it's about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. For a monoprotic acid, the neutralization releases about 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative). For each H+ and OH- combining.

So for each mole of H+ that reacts, about 57 kJ is released.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ (because that's how much OH- is present) react.

So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Options A and B are in kcal. Oh, right, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, some sources might use different values. But the standard is 57 kJ per mole, sometimes approximated as 57 or 56.8 or whatever.

Wait, but let me think. Did I calculate the moles correctly?

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4, so 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting, so 0.2 H+ will react.

So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

If each mole gives off 57 kJ, then 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but that would require converting kJ to kcal.

Wait, no. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 3.8 kcal (since
