Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question says that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E. Another reaction is when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Lastly, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, I think I need to first figure out what the compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are. Once I know E, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me start by looking at each reaction and see if I can deduce the possible compounds.

First reaction: Solid A + 8 gas B → C (bright red). I'm thinking of reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in a high ratio. One possibility is the formation of a metal sulfide, but let me think. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide reacting with a halogen gas? No, because 8 equivalents seem high. Or perhaps it's a reaction where multiple atoms are added. 

Wait, bright red product C. That's a key clue. I remember that when copper reacts with sulfur, it forms copper(II) sulfide, which is black, but maybe another reaction. Oh! Maybe the formation of a compound like CuO? No, that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe sulfur itself is involved. Or perhaps it's the formation of something like PbO2, but that's dark red. Another possibility is that C is a product involving SO3 or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when metals like Fe or Cu react with certain gases. For example, copper reacting with chlorine gas would form CuCl2, which is blue. Not red. Hmm. Maybe it's lead(IV) oxide? PbO2 is dark red. Or perhaps the reaction is about the formation of a sulfur compound.

Alternatively, I've heard that when metals like sodium or potassium react with sulfur, they form sulfides. But that's more of a solid reacting with solid sulfur. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about the formation of a compound like Na2O2? No, that's usually formed by high-temperature reactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The second reaction is C reacting with D to form E. D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. So, H is a solvent, which makes me think of something like water, alcohol, or maybe something else. But D and B in a 1:1 ratio form H. Also, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two acids.

Let me think about acids. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include CH3COOH, H3PO4 maybe.

Wait, when C reacts with water, it gives back A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate ester? Or maybe it's a metal oxide? Let me think: if C is a metal oxide, say CuO, and when it
