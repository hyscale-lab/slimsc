Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Hmm. So, first, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the volume changes, which affects the concentration. So the initial 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 mL of water. That makes the total volume 40 mL. 

The formula I remember is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me plug in the numbers. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL, V2 is 40 mL. So M2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let's compute that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH would produce the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) and water.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially present. But wait, we have to consider the diluted solution. So initially, the diluted acetic acid has a certain amount of moles.

Wait, let's compute the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 mL, which is 0.04 L. Molarity is 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So, 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

At equivalence point, the NaOH will have neutralized all of that. So the NaOH added will be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed would be (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question also asks about 25% titration. That's when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol. So how much NaOH is that? Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid (1:1 ratio), the volume of NaOH would be (0.00025 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL.

But wait, maybe I don't need the volume for the pH calculation. Let me think. For each scenario (25% and equivalence point), I need to find the pH.

Starting with the 25% titration. At this point, part of the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ion.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful here: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

First, find pKa. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa is approximately 4.733.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let's compute log(1.85e-5). Let's see, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So for every mole of acetic acid,
