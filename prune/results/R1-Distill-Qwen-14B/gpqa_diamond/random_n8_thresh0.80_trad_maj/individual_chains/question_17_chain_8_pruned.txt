Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure this out. The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions when there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. Hmm.

I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Or maybe it's a 1:1 ratio because Ca-EDTA is the complex. So the K for the complex formation is the formation constant, Kf, right? Oh wait, but sometimes people refer to the dissociation constant as Kd. Wait, the problem says KCa-EDTA is 5e10. So I think in this case, K is the formation constant. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex. So the initial concentrations before dissociation are [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But as the complex dissociates a little, some Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will form.

So the complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])/[CaEDTA^2-]. So Kf is 5e10.

But wait, wait. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and it's dissociating, then the concentration of Ca²+ will be x, and EDTA^4- will also be x. Because for each mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. So the expression becomes Kf = (x * x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ (x²)/(0.02), since x is probably very small compared to 0.02.

So Kf is 5e10 = x² / 0.02. Solving for x gives x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x is sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.02 M is 2e-2. 5e10 * 2e-2 is 1e9. So x squared is 1e9, x is around 3.16e4 M? That can't be possible because that's like 31,600 M concentration, which is way higher than the initial concentration. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I got the K expression wrong. Let me think again. The K for the dissociation is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. Oh wait, wait, perhaps K given is the dissociation constant, but the problem says KCa-EDTA is 5e10. Oh, I think
