Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index, but that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So I guess I need to consider the effects of the glass's motion on the observed speed of light.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary. But what if the medium is moving? Does that affect the speed? I'm a bit confused. I think in classical mechanics, velocities add up, but when dealing with light, which is an electromagnetic wave, things are different because of relativity, maybe.

Wait, but this is a problem probably intended for classical mechanics, not relativity, since it's about refractive indices and such. Oh, wait, but v is the velocity of the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. Wait, no, the beam is propagating toward the observer because the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the light
