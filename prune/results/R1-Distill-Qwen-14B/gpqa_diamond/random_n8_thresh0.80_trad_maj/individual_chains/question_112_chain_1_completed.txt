Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about an electron's state and finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's parse the problem.

The state is given as |α> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state to find the actual coefficients. Oh right, because when a state is proportional to something, we have to find the normalization constant so that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients equals 1.

So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's calculate the squares of their magnitudes. For (1+i): |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For (2-i): |2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |α> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator given has matrix elements A_ij. So the matrix A has elements where A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because it's for spin up and down. So the matrix looks like:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

So this is the operator with eigenstates that we're supposed to measure. Wait, but the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". So we need to express |α> in the eigenbasis of A and find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, then express |α> in terms of those eigenvectors and find the probabilities.

Wait, but A has elements 0 elsewhere except for off-diagonal elements. Wait, that's a symmetric matrix. Let me think about its eigenvalues.

The matrix is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI)=0.

So determinant is (0 - λ)^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) =0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. For λ=ħ/2, we have the equations (from (A - λ I)|v> =0):

For the first row: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 +v2=0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ=-ħ/2: ( (ħ/2) v1 ) + ( ħ/2 v2 )=0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,-1).

Wait, but these are the eigenvectors for the operator A. So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because, wait, the standard spin-x states are like that.

So the operator A must be proportional to the spin-X operator. Wait, the spin-X operator in the z-basis is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly what A is. So operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli x matrix.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |−x> as I mentioned.

Now, the state |α> is given in the z-basis. To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, I need to express |α> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

So, I can write:

|α> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Where |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let's express |α> in terms of |+> and |->.

Wait, |α> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all over sqrt(7). Let me denote |up> as |↑> and |down> as |↓> for simplicity.

So |α> = [ (1+i)|↑> + (2 -i)|↓> ] / sqrt(7).

Express this in terms of |+> and |->.

|+> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2)

I can solve for |↑> and |↓> in terms of |+> and |->:

|↑> = (|+> + |-> ) / sqrt(2)
|↓> = (|+> - |-> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting into |α>:

|α> = [ (1+i)(|+> + |-> )/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)(|+> - |-> )/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7).

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i)(|+> + |->) + (2 -i)(|+> - |->) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Expanding the numerator:

= [ (1+i)|+> + (1+i)|-> + (2 -i)|+> - (2 -i)|-> ] / sqrt(14).

Combine like terms:

For |+>:

(1+i +2 -i) |+> = (3) |+> 

For |->:

(1+i -2 +i) |-> = ( (1-2) + (i +i) ) |-> = (-1 + 2i) |-> 

So numerator becomes [3 |+> + (-1 + 2i)|-> ].

So |α> = [ 3 |+> + (-1 + 2i)|-> ] / sqrt(14).

Wait, but this can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in expanding. Let me re-do the expansion more carefully.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

(1+i) (|+> + |->) = (1+i)|+> + (1+i)|->
(2 -i) (|+> - |->) = (2 -i)|+> - (2 -i)|->

So adding these:

[(1+i) + (2 -i)] |+> + [(1+i) - (2 -i)] |-> 

Compute each coefficient:

(1+i + 2 -i) = 3 → coefficient for |+>
(1+i -2 +i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i → coefficient for |->

So the numerator is 3 |+> + (-1 + 2i)|->.

So |α> = [3 |+> + (-1 +2i) |-> ] / sqrt(14).

Wait, but sqrt(14) comes from sqrt(2)*sqrt(7). Because denominator is sqrt(2) from the eigenvectors and sqrt(7) from the state normalization.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered that |+> and |-> are orthonormal. So the coefficients c_+ and c_- are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14) respectively.

So the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Calculating |c_+|²: (3)^2 / 14 =9/14 ≈0.642857.

|c_-|²: | (-1 +2i) |² /14. The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5. So 5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait a second. 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So the probabilities are roughly 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 for the average.

But I'm supposed to find the average value of the operator. The average is <A> = <α| A |α>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the state |α> is expressed in terms of the eigenvectors |+> and |->, then the average is |c_+|^2 (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 (-ħ/2).

So let's compute that.

|c_+|^2 is 9/14, |c_-|^2 is 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) (ħ/2) ] /14.

Wait, let's compute:

= (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [9 -5] * ħ/(2*14) ) = 4 * ħ/(28) ) = (4 * ħ) /28 = ħ/7.

So that's ħ/7. So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.6428 (approximately 0.64) and 5/14≈0.3571 (approximately 0.36).

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the probabilities. 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded. So option A's first two values match. And the average is ħ/7. So option A is correct.

But wait, another approach: since the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, then the average value could also be found via <σ_x>, which is the expectation value in the state |α>.

Alternatively, since the state is expressed in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute <A> using matrix representation.

A matrix is (ħ/2)[ [0,1],[1,0] ].

The state |α> is a column vector:

|α> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So <A> is the conjugate transpose of |α> multiplied by A multiplied by |α>.

So let's compute <A>:

⟨α| A |α⟩ = (1/sqrt(7)) [1-i , 2+i ] (ħ/2) [ [0,1],[1,0] ] (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i; 2 -i ]

So let's compute the matrix product first.

Let me compute A |α>:

A |α> = (ħ/2) [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7); (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, ⟨α| A |α⟩ = (1/sqrt(7)) [1 -i, 2 +i ] * (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7); (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So (1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(7)) * (ħ/2) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Wait, let's compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2(1) -1(i) -2i +i². i² is -1.

So 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) )= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i*i.

= 2 +2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

Adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So ⟨A⟩ = (1/7) * (ħ/2) * 2 → (1/7) * ħ → ħ/7.

Which matches the previous calculation. So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option C has different probabilities and average hbar/sqrt(7). Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which sum to 0.9, but wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.3571.

So the correct probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A is the answer.


The problem involves an electron's state |α>, given as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i). The squared magnitudes are:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5.
\]
The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates and eigenvalues of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |−⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of \( A \)
Substitute \( |up⟩ = \frac{|+⟩ + |−⟩}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |down⟩ = \frac{|+⟩ - |−⟩}{\sqrt{2}} \) into |α⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{|+⟩ + |−⟩}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{|+⟩ - |−⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+⟩ + (-1 + 2i)|−⟩ \right].
\]
The coefficients of \(|+⟩\) and \(|−⟩\) are \( c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \).

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
\[
P(+⟩) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-⟩) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+⟩) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-⟩) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute \( P(+⟩) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-⟩) = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
