Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember phase shifts are related to scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics.

Wait, the phase shifts provided are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh right, these are the partial wave phase shifts for different angular momenta. I think each δ_l corresponds to a specific l value. So δ₀ is l=0, δ₁ is l=1, and so on up to l=4.

The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so I only consider l=0 to l=4.

The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam. I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using a sum over these partial waves. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l from 0 to infinity of ( (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l) / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) * (something with spherical Bessel functions or Legendre polynomials... wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the partial wave expansion.

Wait, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) [something else... Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves can be written as:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l f_{l,m}(θ) e^{i m φ}

But since the problem is symmetric around the beam direction, φ is zero, so the imaginary part would come from specific terms.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude's imaginary part along the beam direction (θ=0) is given by the sum over l of certain terms. I remember that when θ is zero, the direction is along the incident beam, and for each l, the associated term has a specific contribution.

Wait, I think the general expression is that the scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is linked to
