Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what it's asking.

Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩². So, for ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z? Or is it? No, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. That's important because if that's the case, then the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ might be straightforward to calculate.

Wait, no. Wait, the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is already diagonal when expressed in the P_z basis. So if the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, but the basis is of P_z, then the state is a linear combination of P_z's eigenstates.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The state is given as a vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So the state is expressed as a linear combination of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩ states, perhaps. But I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Each component corresponds to the eigenstates of P_z. So the first component is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, the second for 0, and the third for -ħ. Wait, looking at the given P_z matrix:

P_z matrix is:

[ ħ    0     0
  0    0     0
  0    0   -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The eigenvectors are the standard
