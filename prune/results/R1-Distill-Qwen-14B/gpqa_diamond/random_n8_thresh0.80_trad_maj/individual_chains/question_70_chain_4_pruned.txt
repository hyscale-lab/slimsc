Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes some reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the molecular shapes and their symmetry elements. So first, I need to figure out what E is, right?

Let me break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Okay, I need to figure out the identities of these compounds. Let's start with reaction 4 because it seems simpler. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Some common solvents are water, ethanol, maybe something like that. Wait, but D and B are gases. Let me think: if H is a solvent, perhaps H is water? No, because B is a gas, maybe H is something else.

Wait, another thought: if B is a gas, what could it be? Maybe B is an element like O2 or Cl2? Let me think about reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. 8 equivalents is a lot. So perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2.

Wait, what about reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. So C plus H2O gives back A and two acids. If F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, that gives a clue.

Wait, maybe A is a metal oxide? Like sodium oxide or something. Let's think: if A is Na2O, and B is Cl2 (a gas), then in reaction 1, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would react with Na2O. Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe A is a carbonate? Or maybe A is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is Cl2. So reaction 1 is metal + Cl2 → product C. For example, Mg + Cl2 → MgCl2. But then reaction 3 is C (MgCl2) reacting with water to give back Mg (A) and two acids. But MgCl2 is a salt, when it reacts with water, it dissociates into Mg^2+ and Cl^- ions. Not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: reaction 3 produces two acids when C reacts with water. So C might be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. Hmm, something like maybe sodium peroxide? Let's think. Sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with water to produce O2 and two strong acids? Wait, no, Na2O2 + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2O2. Wait, but that gives NaOH, which is a strong base, and H2O2, which is a weak acid? No, actually H2O2 is more of an oxidizing agent but not a strong acid. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think about reaction 3 again. When C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. Another possibility is that C is a carbonate. For example, if C is Na2CO3, then Na2CO3 + H2O → 2NaOH + CO2. But CO2 is an acid (carbonic acid, which is weak), but wait, in that case, F would be NaOH? No, because NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, what if C is a sulfide? No, because sulfides reacting with water would produce H2S, which is a weak acid. But where would the strong acid come from?

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 reacts with water to produce NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, that's not matching.

Another thought: maybe C is a metal chloride. Let's think about AlCl3. AlCl3 is a Lewis acid and reacts with water: AlCl3 + 3H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3HCl. So in this case, when C (AlCl3) reacts with water, it gives back Al(OH)3 (which would be A?), and HCl, which is a strong acid (so F is HCl), but what about the other product? Al(OH)3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit with the condition of producing two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's think about sodium peroxide: Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces O2 and NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about reaction 4 again. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like HCl? No, HCl is a gas. Maybe H is H2O? No, because D and B are gases reacting to form H, which is a liquid or perhaps a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3? No, that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4, but I don't think that's a common solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diatomic molecule, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, another approach: D and B are gases, and their reaction produces H as a solvent. Another possibility is that H is an alcohol, but that's less likely because the reaction of two gases to form an alcohol would need specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then their reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But H2O is a solvent. So H is H2O. But then in reaction 4, D (H2) and B (O2) react in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the ratio of H2 to O2 would be 2:1. But in reaction 4, the ratio is 1:1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. But their reaction would be H2 + Cl2 →
