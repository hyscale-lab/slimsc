Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, the question involves two reactions where a chemist uses different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but each comes from a different starting material and a different reducing agent.

Wait, the products are enantiomers, I think. So the starting materials must have some sort of stereochemistry that affects the outcome when reduced. Also, the reducing agents are LiBH4 and BH3, which are different. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used for ketones to form alcohols. But wait, what about BH3? Oh, right, BH3 is typically used for the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which follows anti-Markovnikov addition to alkenes.

Wait a second, but looking at the products, they're both ketones. So maybe the starting materials are something else. Oh, wait, no. If the product is a ketone, perhaps the starting material was an ester or a different kind of carbonyl compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone, like a lactone or something else.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let's think about that structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone at the 2 position.
