Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. And I have four options to choose from. I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order of substituents is important because each step affects the directing groups.

So, first, I should figure out the structure of the target molecule. Let's break it down. The substituents on the benzene ring are:

- A tert-butyl group at position 2.
- An ethoxy group at position 1.
- A nitro group at position 3.

Wait, numbering might be a bit confusing here. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's consider the positions relative to each other. Alternatively, maybe I should draw it out mentally. So, if I number the benzene ring such that the ethoxy is at position 1, then the nitro would be at position 3, and tert-butyl at position 2. But wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me think about the directing effects.

Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's consider each group's nature.

Ethoxy group (-OEt): This is an activating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-donating group (O has lone pairs, so it donates via resonance).

Nitro group (-NO2): This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It withdraws electrons via resonance, making the ring less reactive but directs incoming groups to the meta position relative to itself.

tert-Butyl group: This is a bulky, activating group. It's an alkyl chain, so it's activating (electron-donating via induction), and it's an ortho/para director. But because of its bulk, when it's attached, the para position might be harder to reach because of steric hindrance, so it might favor ortho in some cases, but I think for substitution reactions, the directing effect is more dominant than steric factors, especially in the initial substitution steps.

But wait, the target molecule has all three substituents. So, the order in which they are introduced matters because each new group will direct the next substitution based on its position relative to existing groups.

So, the plan is to figure out the correct order of introducing substituents to get the correct positions.

Let me think about the possible steps. The molecule has ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl groups. Let me think about whether any of these need to be introduced before others due to reaction conditions or directing effects.

In electrophilic substitution, activating groups (like ethoxy and tert-butyl) make the ring more reactive, while deactivating groups (nitro) make it less reactive. But once a substituent is attached, the next substituent is directed by the existing groups.

One important thing is that when introducing multiple substituents, the order and the directing effects will determine their positions.

Let me outline possible sequences.

One approach is to first add the ethoxy group because it's an activating group, which would facilitate the addition of other substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first because it's a strong deactivating group, but that might complicate adding the other groups.

Wait, let's think about the target structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, let's imagine the ring as:

1: ethoxy

2: tert-butyl

3: nitro

Wait, but in benzene, position 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3 (two positions away from ethoxy), and tert-butyl at 2 (next to ethoxy and next to nitro? So, all three substituents are adjacent except for ethoxy and nitro.)

Wait, perhaps I should number it differently. Let me draw it
