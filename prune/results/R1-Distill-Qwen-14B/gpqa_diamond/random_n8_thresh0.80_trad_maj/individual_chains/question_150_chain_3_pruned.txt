Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me think about what that could mean. The molecular formula breaks down into 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. So maybe it's an aromatic compound with some substituents since we're seeing a lot of carbons and possible rings.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That seems like a strong deshielded proton. Maybe an aldehyde proton, since they usually appear around 9-10 ppm. Aldehyde protons are typically sharp singlets, but sometimes coupling can split them into multiplets. Wait, but it's a triplet here. Hmm, maybe it's adjacent to another proton. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton like an enol? Not sure yet.

- 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's around the region for aromatic protons. Maybe a pair of equivalent protons next to substituents.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Another aromatic pair. If the first two are 2H each, maybe they're part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two protons in the ortho positions, each as a doublet?

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an acidic proton. Maybe an enol proton or something with hydrogen bonding. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with two equivalent protons in a position that doesn't split much, like maybe para to substituents.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). That's a quartet? No, it's a doublet. So two protons, maybe on a CH2 group. The chemical shift is around 3.6, which is about where CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen (like ethers or esters) would appear. Wait, but the splitting is a doublet. So perhaps it's a CH2 connected to something else, like another CH2 or maybe an aromatic ring.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule has an aromatic ring with substituents, an aldehyde group, and some ether or ester groups? Or perhaps two aromatic rings connected by a chain that includes an aldehyde group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. 

So, (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond or ring (1), and another double bond (1), or maybe an amine group or something else. Alternatively, a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring (1) but that might complicate
