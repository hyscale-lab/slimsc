Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the question says that both planets have the same mass. They were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key here is that their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if P1 is the period of Planet_1, then Planet_2's period is 3P1.

Wait, wait. No, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, meaning Planet_1's period is P, and Planet_2's is 3P. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period usually means it's closer in (since orbital period depends on the distance from the star, via Kepler's third law).

Now, the stars: the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So Star_1 (host of P1) has M1 = 2*M2, where M2 is the mass of Star_2. But R1 = R2.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (sin i)^2, but assuming random orientation, sin i squared averages to 1/2. Wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(a + R_s)) ), but for a star much larger than the planet, the (a/(a+R_s)) approaches 1. So perhaps the main factors are planet size relative to star and the orbital distance.

Wait, no, the transit probability is actually given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(1 + (a_p / a_s)) ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 and the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size, but perhaps the key is that for a given star, a planet with a smaller orbital period (so closer in) has a higher chance of transiting because the orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on from our perspective.
