Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, especially in the context of the hydroiodolysis reaction. Wait, no—red phosphorus is more commonly used with HI in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, that's for eliminating carbonyl groups. Or maybe it's the hydroboration reaction? Wait, no, red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm confusing things. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI might be involved in the cleavage of certain functional groups. Hmm, perhaps I should think about this reaction.

Wait, wait. I think when you treat esters or acid chlorides with red phosphorus and HI, it leads to the formation of alcohols. Or wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used to remove esters, maybe in the formation of alkanes. Wait, no, perhaps I should first figure out what Compound X is based on the spectral data provided, and then see what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

The problem provides IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let's look at the IR first.

The IR shows strong peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region is typical for O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, there's also
