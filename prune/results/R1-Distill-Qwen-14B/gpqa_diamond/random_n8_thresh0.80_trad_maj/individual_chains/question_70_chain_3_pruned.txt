Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions leading to product E, and the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are various symmetry groups like C2, D4h, Dâˆžh, and C2v. I remember from my chemistry classes that molecular symmetry groups are determined by the arrangement of atoms and their mirror planes, axes of rotation, etc.

So, let's break down each reaction to figure out what each chemical might be.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. I'm thinking of metals reacting with diatomic gases. For example, maybe B is chlorine (Cl2) because 8 equivalents could imply a valency of 2 for A and multiple Cl atoms. If A is a metal like copper, reacting with Cl2 might produce CuCl2, but copper typically gives a blue solution. Alternatively, maybe it's another transition metal. Wait, what about sulfur? No, sulfur with something else... Alternatively, perhaps A is iron? Iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But wait, 8 equivalents... Wait, if B is O2, maybe A is something else. Or another possibility: what if A is sodium? Sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl, but that's 1:1. 8 equivalents would imply 4 moles of Cl2 for each mole of A. Wait, maybe A is something else.

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents could mean 8 moles of B per 1 mole of A. So, maybe the formula of product C is A(B)_8. For example, if B is Cl, then A would have a +8 charge, which is unlikely. So maybe B isn't Cl. Alternatively, maybe B is O2. But O2 usually has a 2- charge in oxides. Wait, maybe A is a metal with a +2 charge reacting with O2 to form an oxide with O in a certain ratio. For example, if A is copper, CuO would be 1:1, but maybe CuO isn't red. Alternatively, maybe A is chromium, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another approach: the product C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? I recall that copper(II) sulfate solution is blue, so that's not it. Lead dioxide is dark brown. Iron(III) oxide is reddish. Oh! Maybe C is iron(
