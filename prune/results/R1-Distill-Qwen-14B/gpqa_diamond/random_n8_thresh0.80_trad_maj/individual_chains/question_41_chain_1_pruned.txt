Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question asks what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the laboratory observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the glass is moving, right? And the light is inside this moving glass. So, how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light in it? I remember there's something about the Doppler effect when sources or observers are moving, but that's usually about frequency or wavelength changes, not the speed.

Wait, wait, classical mechanics says that velocities add up. So, if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside is moving at speed v_light relative to the glass, then relative to the lab, the speed would be v_light plus v? But that can't be right because light speed is supposed to be constant in any inertial frame according to Einstein's postulate, right?

Oh wait, but this is about a medium. So maybe that's different. Because in a medium, the speed of light depends on the medium's properties. Like, in water or glass, light slows down. But if the medium is moving, does that affect the speed in the lab frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think. The speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum and n is the refractive index. So in the glass, the speed is v_light = c/n. But if the glass itself is moving, does that mean the light's speed relative to the lab is v_light + v? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light is moving through the glass, which is moving. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the sum of its velocity in the glass and the glass's velocity. Oh wait, but that's in the same direction. So if the glass is moving towards the observer (since the beam is moving towards the observer), and the light is moving through
