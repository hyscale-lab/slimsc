Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out the structure of the starting material and then see what happens after each reaction step to identify the final product.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at: 9.72 (triplet, 1H), 6.98 (doublet, 2H), 6.51 (doublet, 2H), 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H), and 3.66 (doublet, 2H). 

Hmm, the triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So that suggests there's an aldehyde group (-CHO) in the molecule.

Looking at the other signals: the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have 2H. These could be from aromatic protons. The 6.27 singlet might be from some vinyl protons or perhaps an aromatic ring with some coupling. The 3.66 doublet for 2H could be from a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group?

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring (a benzene ring) which is three degrees, a double bond or another ring, and perhaps an aldehyde group (which is a double bond, so another degree). So maybe a benzene ring with some substituents, a double bond, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, the aldehyde is probably part of the main chain. Let me think about the structure. The aldehyde is at around 9.72. So maybe the molecule has an aldehyde group attached to a chain that has some substituents, including another benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 (1H) suggests that the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because a triplet in the aldehyde region might mean coupling with two neighboring protons. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually singlet because they have no adjacent hydrogens (like in RCHO). Wait, that's the thing. Maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group which is split into a triplet. Wait, no, aldehyde protons don't have neighboring protons, so maybe the triplet is something else? Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system where the aldehyde is part of a larger conjugated system, like an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde).

Wait, the
