Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? Because 1000 cm³ is a liter, so 200 divided by 1000 is 0.2. Got that down.

The solution contains 1.00 gram of KH2PO4 and 1.00 gram of Na2HPO4●2H2O. Hmm, I remember that these are phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, but the one here has two waters of crystallization, so that might affect its molar mass.

The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4●2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Wait, I should probably calculate the molar amounts of each of these substances first.

So for KH2PO4, moles = mass / Mw. That's 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 136 is approximately 0.00735 moles. Maybe more precisely, 1/136.09 is about 0.007335 moles? Let me double-check that. 136.09 * 0.007335 = approximately 1.000 grams, yeah that's right.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4●2H2O, it's 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1 divided by 177.99 is approximately 0.005614 moles. Let me see, 177.99 * 0.005614 is about 1, so that's correct.

So now I have moles of each. But wait, these are salts of phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps. The Ka values are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

I remember that each of these salts will dissociate in solution. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since K+ is the cation), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (since Na+ is the cation). So when these salts dissolve, they'll release H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions, respectively.

Now, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or PO4^3-, right? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think about the phosphate species.

H3PO4 can lose three protons:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-
2.
