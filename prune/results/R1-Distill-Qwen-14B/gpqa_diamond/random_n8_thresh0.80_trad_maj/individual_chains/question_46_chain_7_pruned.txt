Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, probably rhodium or ruthenium based, used for ring-closing or cross metathesis.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that out. The structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH₂CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me count.

Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH2CH3)-something? Wait, maybe I should write it as:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. So positions 1 to 5.

So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, pentene has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Yes, that makes sense. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, no, that's four carbons after the double bond. Let me count
