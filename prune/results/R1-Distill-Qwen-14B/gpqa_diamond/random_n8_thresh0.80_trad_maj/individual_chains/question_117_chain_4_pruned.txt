Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it has four different groups attached to a carbon atom. Alternatively, some molecules might show optical activity without a chiral center, but I think that's more advanced and maybe not relevant here. So, for each compound, I'll check if there's a chiral center.

Let's look at each one:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl compounds can sometimes have stereoisomerism, especially if the substituents are in positions that allow for different configurations. Wait, the substituents here are at positions 2,2' and 6,6'. So the biphenyl has two substituents on each ring. Oh wait, if the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', the substituents are at 2 and 6. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. Wait, but for the biphenyl to have stereoisomerism, the substituents on each ring need to create a situation that allows for different spatial arrangements. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are the same, like both are nitro and carboxylate groups, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. Or wait, maybe the arrangement leads to a possibility of enantiomers. Wait, let me think. If the substituents are on both rings, but in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the compound has a center where four different groups meet, then it's chiral. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself isn't chiral, but the substituents create a situation that leads to isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit confused on this one. Maybe I should move on and come back later.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the structure is MeO2C-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOOCCH(OH)CH3? Wait no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be OMe group on the acid. Wait, maybe I should draw it. Let's see: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH(OH)CH3? Or wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the carbon chain is three carbons. The first carbon is the ester (COOCH3), then the second has the hydroxyl (OH), and the third is methyl (CH3). So that's CH2(OH)CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, propanoate is CH
