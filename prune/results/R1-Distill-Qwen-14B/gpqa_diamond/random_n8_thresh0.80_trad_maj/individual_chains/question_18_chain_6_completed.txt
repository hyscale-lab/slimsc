Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't think the masses directly affect the abundance ratios, except maybe if there's something about metallicity or age, but I'm not sure right now. Let's focus on the given abundances.

The question gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method, under LTE. The values are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) or vice versa? Wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So it's n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Wait, no, the wording says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that could be n_Si,1 / n_Si,2. But I need to make sure.

The approach is to find [Si/H] for each star, then calculate n_Si1 /n_Si2 as (10^[Si/H]_1 ) / (10^[Si/H]_2) ) multiplied by (n_H,1 / n_H,2 ). But wait, but if the stars are in LTE and we're considering their photospheric compositions, perhaps assuming that H is the same in both? Or maybe I need to find [Si/H] for both stars and then find the ratio.

Wait, let's clarify. The question gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe/n_H) in the star relative to the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 = 0, which is the same as the Sun's value.

So first, let's find [Si/H] for each star. 

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Fe/H]_1 = 0. 

[Si/Fe] = log(n_Si /n_Fe) - log(n_Si,sun /n_Fe,sun) = 0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning that log(n_Fe1 /n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) = 7.5 (since Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH_sun = 10^(-5).

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe1 /n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) → so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1 /n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) +0.3. Because [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun).

Let me compute that. 

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1 /n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

We know that for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = log( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) / (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) = log( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) / (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) ) ) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) = (7 -7.5) = -0.5. So the Sun's [Si/Fe] is -0.5?

Wait wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg, log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH_sun = 1e-5.

But for Si? The Sun's n_Si isn't given. Hmm, but I think for the Sun, the [X/Fe] ratios can be inferred. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me find [Si/H] for each star.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → same Fe/H as Sun. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

We can compute [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_H1) = log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * (n_Fe1/n_H1) ) ) = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.

Which is 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, the given ratios are [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_H2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) =0 → so n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log( (n_Mg2/n_H2) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) = [Mg/H]_2 + log(1/(n_Si2/n_H2)) ).

Wait, maybe a better approach.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2 /n_Si2) = log( (n_Mg2/n_H2) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) = [Mg/H]_2 - log(n_Si2/n_H2) = 0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → [Mg/Si]_2 = - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3.

Wait, wait. Let me think: [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log( (n_Mg2/n_H2) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) ) = log( n_Mg2/n_Si2 ) = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Because [Mg/H]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_H2), and [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2/n_H2).

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

So substituting:

0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that would mean that [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So the abundance of Si is lower in Star_2 relative to H compared to the Sun.

Wait, but wait. Let me recompute.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2 /n_Si2) = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/Si]_2 is given as 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So:

0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3.

Now, what about Star_1? [Si/H]_1 was 0.3.

So the question is, what is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2.

So n_Si1 / n_Si2 = (10^([Si/H]_1) * n_H1 ) / (10^([Si/H]_2) * n_H2 )

But wait, the H in each star's photosphere is probably not the same. Hmm, but I don't have information about the total hydrogen in each star. Oh, but wait, in stellar atmospheres, when we talk about [X/H], it's the logarithm of the ratio of the element's number density to the hydrogen number density, relative to the Sun. So the [X/H] is the logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun. 

But wait, perhaps the ratio n_Si1 /n_Si2 is (10^[Si/H]_1) * (n_H1) / (10^[Si/H]_2) * (n_H2) ) ).

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, how can we proceed? Hmm, but wait, perhaps the ratio of the H's is the same as the ratio of the Fe's or Mg's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the ratio of silicon in two stars is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1 / n_H1) * (n_H2 / n_Si2) ) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

But this seems complicated. Wait, let's think in terms of [Si/H].

We have:

n_Si1 = 10^{[Si/H]_1} * (n_H_sun / 1e12) ) * n_H1 ?

Wait, maybe it's better to write the abundances in terms of the Sun's.

The definition of [X/H] is log(n_X /n_H) - log(n_X_sun /n_H_sun) ) = [X/H].

So for Star_1: n_Si1 /n_H1 = 10^{[Si/H]_1} * (n_X_sun / n_H_sun) )

Wait, no. Let me recall that [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun).

So rearranged:

log(n_X/n_H) = [X/H] + log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun).

So n_X/n_H = 10^{[X/H]} * (n_X_sun/n_H_sun) ) * 10^{log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun)} }.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.

n_Si1 / n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But I don't know (n_H1/n_H2). Hmm, but wait, perhaps both stars have the same metallicity? Or perhaps not. Let's see.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Similarly, Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But how about the total H in each star? Well, perhaps the stars have the same H abundance relative to each other in some way, but I'm not sure. Wait, but we don't have any [H/... ] info except for Fe and Mg in each.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the H in the two stars using another element. For example, using Fe and Mg.

Wait, let's think about the ratio n_H1 /n_H2.

Wait, Star_1 and Star_2 have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as follows:

Star_1: [Fe/H]=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = same as Sun.

Star_2: [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = same as Sun.

But what about, say, the hydrogen in each star? Are they the same? Probably not, unless the stars have the same [H/Fe] or something else.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe another approach: consider that the total number of heavy elements can be a clue, but I don't think that's given.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the ratio of H in the Sun relative to itself, which is 1. Wait, no, that can't be. Because each star's [X/H] is relative to their own H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

We need to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = (n_Si1 / n_H1) * (n_H2 / n_Si2) ) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

But without knowing (n_H1 /n_H2), I can't proceed. So maybe I have to find another way.

Wait, but maybe I can find (n_H1 /n_H2) using another element which is present in both stars.

Wait, wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies that the Fe abundance relative to H is same as the Sun. So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) * n_H1.

In Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H2.

But how can I relate n_H1 to n_H2? I don't see a direct way. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can use the Fe and Mg in the two stars to find such a relation.

Wait, let's think about the Fe and Mg content in each star and see if we can relate n_H1 and n_H2.

For Star_1:

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

n_Si1 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

n_Si2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/H]_2, but I found earlier that [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

Wait, earlier I think I found [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

n_Si2 =10^{-0.3} * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = [10^0.3 /10^{-0.3}] * [n_H1 /n_H2 ].

10^0.3 /10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, approximately 4.

So n_Si1/n_Si2 ≈ 4 * (n_H1/n_H2).

But I don't know n_H1/n_H2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_H1 and n_H2 in terms of some other element.

Wait, for Star_1, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

In Star_2, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

But without knowing anything else, I can't relate n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, perhaps if I consider another element that's present in both stars, but I don't have any such data.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the H abundance is the same in both stars, which would make n_H1 =n_H2, so the ratio would be 4.

But that's an assumption, and I'm not sure if it's valid. Alternatively, perhaps Star_1 and Star_2 have the same metallicity, but that's not given either.

Wait, considering that Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, which is same as the Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0. Does that imply that Star_2 has [Fe/H]=0 as well? Not necessarily, because [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are independent unless we know about their ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back to the start.

Wait, perhaps we can find [Si/H] for both stars, and then the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 would be (10^[Si/H]_1 / 10^[Si/H]_2) × (n_H1/n_H2).

But without knowing n_H1/n_H2, I can't find the ratio.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio n_H1/n_H2 can be determined using another element, like Fe and Mg.

Wait, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But if I have another element that's present in both stars, perhaps I can relate them.

Wait, Star_1's [Mg/Si] is not given, but perhaps if I can find Mg in Star_1, but I don't have the data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

Earlier, I found that the part that doesn't involve n_H1/n_H2 is 10^0.6 ≈4. So if the ratio is 4, but multiplied by the ratio of H's.

If I can't find the H ratio, perhaps the assumption is that the H is same in both stars, so n_H1/n_H2 =1. Then the ratio is 4, which is option A.

But why would that assumption be correct? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps because both stars have the same metallicity, but that's not given.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, same as the Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, same as the Sun. But their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] don't necessarily tell us about each other.

Wait, perhaps the metallicity is the same. Let me think: metallicity is usually [Fe/H], but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. So I can't assume that.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Fe/H] for Star_2.

Wait, for Star_2, I don't have [Fe/H], but I have [Mg/H]=0. So unless I can relate Mg and Fe, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the ratio of silicon is (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) × (n_H1/n_H2) ) = 10^{0.6} × (n_H1/n_H2).

But without knowing n_H1/n_H2, perhaps the data is insufficient, but the question expects us to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the H in both stars is the same, so n_H1 =n_H2, making the ratio 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

So the answer might be A) ~3.9.

But why would n_H1 =n_H2? Since the stars have different masses, but that doesn't necessarily mean their H abundances are the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a wrong assumption earlier about [Si/H]_2.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for [Si/H]_2.

Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

[Mg/Si] = log(n_Mg/n_Si) = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So [Mg/Si] =0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

[Mg/H]_2 is 0, so 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Yes, that seems correct.

So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) × (n_H1/n_H2) ) =10^{0.6} × (n_H1/n_H2) ≈ 4 × (n_H1/n_H2).

So if the H ratio is 1, then the ratio is 4, which is option A.

But I'm stuck on the H ratio. Alternatively, perhaps in the Sun's case, the [X/H] is given, but for both stars, their [X/H] is relative to their own H, so the [X/H] is measured per their own H.

Wait, perhaps if I can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars, which would make n_H1 =n_H2 → the ratio would be 4, option A.

But why would H be the same? Well, the question doesn't provide any other data, so perhaps that's the assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the stars have the same metallicity, but that's not given.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the H ratio using another element. Let's see.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = same as Sun.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 →n_Mg2/n_H2 = same as Sun.

If I can find [Fe/Mg]_1 and [Fe/Mg]_2, perhaps I can find something. But I don't have that information either.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for the Sun, n_Fe/n_H_sun =1e-4.5, and n_Mg/n_H_sun =1e-5.

So for Star_1:

n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H1.

For Star_2:

n_Mg2 = (1e-5) *n_H2.

But without knowing any other element's abundance, I can't find a relation between n_H1 and n_H2.

Hmm, perhaps the ratio of H is 1, but I'm not sure.

In the absence of more data, I think the intended approach is to assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars, making the ratio of silicon atoms about 4, hence option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the definitions of stellar abundance ratios. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

3. **Sun's photospheric composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5

### Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for each star
- **Star_1**:
  - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun.
  - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that the Si/Fe ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
  - Using the relationship [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], we find:
    \[
    [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
    \]

- **Star_2**:
  - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies that the Mg/Si ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
  - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies that the Mg/H ratio is the same as the Sun.
  - Using the relationship [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], we solve for [Si/H]:
    \[
    0.3 = 0 - [\text{Si/H}]_2 \implies [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3
    \]

### Step 2: Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}}{10^{[\text{Si/H}]_2} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}
\]
Substituting the values of [Si/H]:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the ratio
- \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), so the ratio simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.98 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}
  \]
- The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen abundance ratio (\(n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}}\)). However, since no additional data is given, it is reasonable to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars (\(n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1\)).

Thus:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.98
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A
