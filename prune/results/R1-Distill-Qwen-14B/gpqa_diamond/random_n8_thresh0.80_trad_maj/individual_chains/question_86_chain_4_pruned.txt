Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one for both. The starting materials are compounds A and B, each treated with a different reagent: LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is also a reducing agent, but I think they work differently. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, BH3 is used in the formation of boranes, and for ketone reductions. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. LiBH4 is a common reducing agent for carbonyl groups, like ketones and aldehydes, right? And BH3, when used with something like THF, forms a borane that can also reduce carbonyls. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences in their reactivity or conditions.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. Because the product has the same configuration (R and S), I think the starting materials must be different in configuration but lead to the same product. Or maybe the same configuration leads to different products? Wait, no, the product is R in one reaction and S in another. Wait no, the question says A gives (R) and B gives (S). Let me see the question again.

Wait, the products are (R)- and (S)-4-ethyl...? No, no. Let me check. The problem says:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

So A gives R, B gives S. So the reducing agents must cause the formation of different stereoisomers.

Wait, but how does that happen? Let me think about the reactions. Both are reducing a carbonyl group to an alcohol, but wait, the product is a ketone. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with an ester or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones, which upon
