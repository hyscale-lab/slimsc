Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. The problem gives some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. 

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, but wait a second. The way these are written is a bit confusing. Oh right, the notation [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, but maybe the other way around. Wait no, the standard is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio, with the Sun's ratio as the reference.

So, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 for Star_2, so nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

Now, the question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait, but how do we get there? Let's break it down.

First, let's find the ratios of the elements in each star relative to the Sun.

Starting with Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe
