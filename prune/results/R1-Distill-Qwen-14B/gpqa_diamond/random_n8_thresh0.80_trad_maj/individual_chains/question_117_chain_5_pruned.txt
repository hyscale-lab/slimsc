Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, let me think. I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are enantiomers, which make the substance chiral. Chiral centers are key hereâ€”atoms bonded to four different groups.

So the question lists four compounds, and I need to check which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1', and the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. Wait, the dinitro groups are in the 6 positions, which are on each ring. Also, each ring has a carbonyl group (the dicarboxylate). I'm thinking about the symmetry here. If the substituents are symmetrical, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. But wait, the 6,6' positions are nitro groups. So each ring has a nitro and a carbonyl. Are there any chiral centers? I don't think so because the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are flat. Unless there's some sort of axial chirality. Oh, wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable. So if the two rings are connected, and the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetric, then yes. Let me visualize: positions 2 and 2' have the ester groups (OOCR), and 6 and 6' have nitro groups. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, the biphenyl could have axial chirality. So this compound probably has optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's like a propionate ester with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2OH? Or wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO- maybe? Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but
