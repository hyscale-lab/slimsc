Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and the excitation of atoms in stellar atmospheres. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, wait, I should clarify what "excited" means here. I think it refers to the number of atoms in a specific energy level being higher. So maybe the population of a certain excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, 1.38 is a familiar number. That's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k_B * something. Let me recall the formula for the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (n2/n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) ), where T is the temperature. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), this should apply here.

In this problem, the excited state is n2 for star 1 and n2 for star 2, but the ratio is given as n1_2 / n2_2 = 2. Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the number in star_1 and n2 in star_2 for the same energy level.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n_upper / n_lower = 2 for star_1 and something else for star_2. Wait, no. Let me re-read the question.

The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's model this.

Assuming that the excitation refers to the population of a particular energy level. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1. In star_1, the number of atoms in E2 is twice that in star_2. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's the same energy level in both stars. So for the same energy level, the population is higher in star_1.

Wait, perhaps it's the same energy level. For example, the ratio of the number of atoms in a certain level between the two stars. Let me model this.

Let me denote n as the number of atoms in an energy level. Then, n1 = 2 * n2, where n1 is star_1 and n2 is star_2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations in two
