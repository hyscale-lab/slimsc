Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is S_z. So, the state is a linear combination of these basis states.

The first part is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds a bit like an anti-diagonal matrix or maybe something else. Let me think.

Wait, the matrix is for a 2x2 system because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, I think. So, the operator A has matrix elements where the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2      0 ]

Hmm, that's interesting. I think this matrix corresponds to the Pauli X operator multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply by ħ/2, you get the matrix given for A_ij.

Wait, but what's the operator represented by this matrix? Oh right, the Pauli X operator is related to the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of A would correspond to the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction, perhaps. But wait, the operator A is given, so we don't have to think about the Pauli matrices directly. We just need to find the eigenstates of A because when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto these eigenstates.

Wait, but maybe I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Let's compute that. The matrix for A is:

A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So, the eigenvalues λ satisfy the equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

The determinant is ( -λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ±ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found. Let's do that for λ = ħ/2.

(A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0 → [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] v = 0.

This gives the equations:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, 1] for λ=ħ/2, and [1, -1] for λ=-ħ/2. But we can normalize them.

Wait, but the eigenvectors for spin operators are usually unit vectors, so let's compute their normalization. Let's take v = (1,1). The norm is sqrt(1² +1²) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) and (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates of the operator A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), assuming that A corresponds to the spin-x operator scaled by ħ/2. But I think the exact correspondence might not matter here as long as we find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

But first, I need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. Alternatively, since the eigenstates are orthonormal, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state |alpha>.

Wait, but first, I need to express |alpha> in the basis of the eigenstates of A. Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |−x>,

where |+x> and |−x> are the eigenstates of A with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Wait, but |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z, not the same as the eigenstates of A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A by taking inner products with each eigenstate.

But let
