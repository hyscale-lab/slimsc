Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed of a particle in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators. In the classical, non-relativistic case, a harmonic oscillator has potential energy proportional to x squared, right? The potential is (1/2)kx². The force is F = -kx, which gives the equation of motion as F = m a = -kx. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so things might be different.

In the relativistic scenario, I remember that the momentum isn't just mv because of the effects of special relativity. Oh right, the relativistic momentum p is gamma times m v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So that could complicate things because now the equations of motion are different.

Wait, the problem mentions that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So the force is still F = -kx, but the motion would be governed by relativistic mechanics, probably using the momentum form. So maybe the equation of motion isn't the usual F = ma, but something else.

Another approach: for a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized in the quantum case, but here we're talking about the classical version, so energy conservation should apply. The total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential energy.

Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc², so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So the total energy E would be (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2)kx².

At the point of maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. So at maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum.

So let's set up the energy conservation equation. At maximum amplitude x=A:

E = (gamma(A) - 1) mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, no. Wait, gamma(A) is when the particle is at x=A, which it's not moving, but that might not be correct. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The maximum speed occurs when the particle passes through x=0, right? So at that point, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So the total energy E would be the kinetic energy at x=0 plus the potential energy at any point, but wait,
