Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break it down.

First, the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, typically forming an alkene. Since both bromines are on adjacent carbons in adamantane, heating with KOH should lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So, product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form a diene. Hmm, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3. In adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three others. So when KOH is used, perhaps two elimination steps happen, but wait, only two bromines are present. Oh, wait, wait—no, it's 1,3-dibromo, so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. So the reaction would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Wait, wait—adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a diamond lattice. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on carbons 1 and 3. So during elimination, perhaps each Br is removed with a base, leading to the formation of a double bond between 1 and 2, and then another between 2 and 3? No, wait, perhaps it's a single elimination, but wait, that would form a single double bond. Hmm.

Wait, no—each molecule of KOH removes a Br. So two E2 eliminations would occur. So each Br is abstracted, leading to two adjacent double bonds? Wait, but that's not possible in a single molecule. Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a single double bond. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, I think. Because in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent. So, when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene? Wait, no, because each elimination would form a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. So for two Brs on adjacent carbons (like 1 and 2), elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, but wait, that would require two Brs on adjacent carbons. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on 1 and 3. So perhaps they are not adjacent. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a bit complex. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others. The positions 1 and 3—wait, perhaps they are not adjacent but separated by a carbon. So maybe the Brs are on carbons that are separated by one carbon each, so when KOH is added, each Br is eliminated, leading to a diene. So product 1 is 1,3-diene, but that's not possible because double bonds can't be conjugated in that way in adamantane. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a single elimination, but that would leave a single double bond. Wait, but the 1H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm as a doublet (2H), which suggests that there are two equivalent protons in an environment that's split into a doublet. Then, in the IR, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is after KOH. Oh wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, the initial reaction is with KOH, so if the product is an epoxide, but no, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide? No, that's when you have a dihalide and treat with a base but in an epoxidation reaction, but I don't think KOH does that. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Hmm. Oh wait, wait—maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but since there are two bromines, perhaps two eliminations occur, forming an allene or a conjugated diene. But the IR of product 1 shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. So that suggests that product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but some kind of substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base. Wait, for substitution, we need a good leaving group, which Br is. So maybe it's a double substitution. Wait, but in that case, how would you form a carbonyl?

Ah, wait, perhaps the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Wait, no, that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but in a way that forms a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? Or maybe the product is an enol? Hmm, getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl, likely a ketone or maybe an ester. Since we're using KOH, which is a strong base, but not typically an oxidizing agent. So perhaps the reaction is a oxidation of a dihalide to form a diketone? But I don't think KOH is an oxidizing agent. Wait, but maybe it's a case of elimination followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diene, and then some other reaction occurs. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to an allene, but then what gives the IR peak for a carbonyl? That doesn't fit. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diene but a diketone. How would that happen? If the two Br atoms are replaced by two ketones. But wait, how? Normally, substitution with something like a hydroxide would replace Br with OH, but not ketone groups. Unless there's some kind of oxidation. Oh wait, maybe the KOH is acting as a base in an elimination, but then the product isn't an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that doesn't lead to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR. Product 1 has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. That's often indicative of a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group or in an ether, or maybe an epoxide. Wait, but if it's a ketone, the adjacent protons would be deshielded. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm is a pair of protons that are part of a diastereotopic pair or perhaps in an allene structure. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a diene, but then perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. No, because epoxides typically show peaks around 3.5-4.5 ppm, and the splitting would depend on adjacent protons. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Ah! Maybe the reaction is a double elimination with formation of a ketone. Wait, I'm not familiar with that reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 are two carbons that are not adjacent. So each Br is on a different carbon, but perhaps each is part of a bridge structure. So when KOH is added, each Br might leave, and the electrons form double bonds.

Wait, but in that case, two Brs would leave, and each would form a double bond. So maybe the product is a diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a double bond (which would be around 1650 cm^-1). The IR shows 1720, which is for a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is an elimination followed by some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a ketone via a different mechanism. Wait, maybe the product is a ketone formed via elimination of Br and oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an O- group, but that doesn't lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. How? If both Brs are replaced by ketone groups, but that would require two substitutions, which seems unlikely with KOH.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring. But cyclopropane would have different NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol, but that would have different IR characteristics.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide, as far as I remember, is used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 has a carbonyl group, which would make product 2 undergo acylation. But wait, product 1's NMR shows a 4.79 ppm (2H) which is a doublet, and a characteristic IR peak for a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

If product 1 is a ketone, then reaction with aluminum isopropoxide could be a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyne, but I don't see how that fits.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ketone. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is indicative of a ketone or possibly an aldehyde (but aldehyde is higher, around 1720-1710). So perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

If product 1 is a ketone, then when it reacts with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of Diels-Alder reaction, but without a dienophile, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction is product 1 heated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts. So if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's try to think about the third step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. But wait, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

But wait, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. However, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Wait, but let's try to piece this together.

First, product 1 has a carbonyl group (IR at 1720), so maybe a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of oxidation or acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, which upon reaction with aluminum isopropoxide forms an epoxide. But the IR of product 1 doesn't show a peak indicative of an epoxide (around 1250 cm^-1 for C-O-C). So maybe that's not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH (excess) could produce a diketone. How? Well, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But wait, that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Unless, perhaps, there's some kind of pericyclic reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. But adamantane is a very stable structure, so ring-opening is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. Because cyclopropane rings can form via elimination of two HBr molecules. So from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination of two HBr would form a cyclopropane ring. Then, the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 doesn't fit, though, because cyclopropane doesn't have a carbonyl.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should proceed to the next step and see if that gives any clues.

So, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might be an enol ether or an acetal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps aluminum isopropoxide is used to form an epoxide if product 1 is a diene. But product 1's IR doesn't suggest a diene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene. Let's say it's a conjugated diene. Then, product 2, upon treatment with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a catalyst for some reactions, perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction. But without a dienophile, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienol ether, but I'm not sure.

Moving on to the third step: product 2 is ozonolyzed. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. Specifically, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would likely be near an electronegative group or a carbonyl.

So, in product 3, after ozonolysis and workup, perhaps we have two carbonyl groups. The workup with dimethyl sulfide would reduce any ozonides to aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Let's imagine product 2 is a diene, so ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The NMR would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

Wait, but product 3's NMR would have protons adjacent to carbonyls, which typically show up as triplets or doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, but in the case where the most deshielded proton is adjacent to a carbonyl, it would couple with neighboring protons. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', then the CH2 protons next to the carbonyl would be split by their neighboring CH2.

Alternatively, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the protons on the CH2 next to the aldehyde would be near a carbonyl and could have a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, but perhaps product 3 is a diketone or has two ketone groups. Then, the most deshielded protons would be those adjacent to the carbonyls.

Let me try to reconstruct the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 with KOH. Assume product 1 is a diene or a ketone. But IR suggests a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone.

2. Product 1 → product 2 with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or a dienol ether.

3. Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is an epoxide. But then ozonolysis wouldn't do much, because epoxide is a three-membered ring ether. Alternatively, product 2 could have a new double bond formed.

Wait, maybe I should think about product 1 again. If product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H), perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. So if product 1 is an epoxide, then the IR would not show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit. So that must not be it.

Hmm. Another approach: the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let's say product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether formed via some kind of enolization and acylation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 undergoes some kind of ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a double elimination forming a cyclopropane. So product 1 is cyclopropane with two ketone groups attached. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, product 2, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, could undergo a Claisen or aldol condensation, forming a conjugated enone. Then, product 2 would have a conjugated double bond, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyls.

Wait, if product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone), then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the NMR would show the protons adjacent to them.

So, the protons adjacent to carbonyls are typically split by neighboring protons. For example, if a CH2 is next to a carbonyl, and each CH2 has two protons, they would couple with each other and possibly with other neighboring groups.

Wait, let's say product 3 is a diketone with a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split into a triplet if they have two neighboring protons on each side.

Wait, but each CH2 group would have two protons. If each CH2 is between two carbonyls, then each H would be adjacent to two others. Wait, but that's not possible; in reality, each CH2 would be next to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each end is a carbonyl. For example, if product 2 was a diene, say CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. Wait, but that's for a simple diene. If product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but product 3's NMR is what's needed. The most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl. Let's imagine that each of these groups is a ketone, say R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. So the protons on the central CH2 groups would be next to two carbonyls. So each of these protons would be adjacent to two others on the same CH2, and each CH2 would be next to another CH2. So each proton on the central CH2 would have neighboring protons on both sides.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl on both sides, so the protons on CH2 would be next to another CH2 group, leading to coupling with two sets of protons.

Wait, for example, consider a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Ozonolysis of a diene could yield such a structure. Then, the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring protons on either side. So each H on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, but let's think about the coupling pattern. Each proton on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be next to another CH2 group. So each H would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the coupling would be with two different sets of Hs.

Wait, for example, each H on CH2-A would be next to two Hs on CH2-B. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But if each H is also coupled with Hs on the adjacent CH2, perhaps leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but perhaps each CH2 is attached to a carbonyl on both ends, so each CH2 is between two carbonyls. So the structure would be O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO-O, for example. Then, the CH2 in the middle would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is only next to one other CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, let's think about a more simple case: after ozonolysis, product 3 is a diketone with a structure like (CH2)2(CO)2. Then, the central CH2 groups would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other. Wait, no—each H on the central CH2 would have two Hs on the same CH2 (so they're equivalent and don't split each other) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (which are equivalent as well). So each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. Wait, but that's the typical case for a CH2 group between two CH2 groups, leading to a triplet for each H.

Wait, but then why the question asks about the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be those adjacent to the carbonyl groups. So in that case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. Each proton on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl (let's call this CH2-A) is next to another CH2 group (CH2-B). Each H on CH2-A is adjacent to two Hs on CH2-B. So each H on CH2-A would be split into a triplet by the two Hs on CH2-B. But if the coupling between CH2-A and CH2-B is such that each H on CH2-A is coupled with two Hs on CH2-B, the splitting would be a triplet. However, if there's another coupling, such as between CH2-A and a CH2 further away, it could lead to a more complex pattern.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O, then each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So the protons on each CH2 would be next to two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each H on CH2-A would be split into a triplet by the two Hs on CH2-B. So the NMR would show a triplet for those protons.

But the options given are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to more splitting. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-O, then the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. So each H on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. Each H would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a quintet.

Wait, no. Let's break it down. Each H on the middle CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the left and two on the right. So the coupling to the left is two Hs, and the coupling to the right is two Hs. So each H would be split by both sets of couplings. The overall splitting would be the product of the two. So for each H, the splitting from the left would be a triplet, and the splitting from the right would also be a triplet. So the splitting pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if each coupling is similar, the pattern might simplify, but perhaps it remains as a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are different, it could be a more complex pattern.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be the ones adjacent to the carbonyl groups. So for each CH2 next to a carbonyl, the Hs are split by the adjacent CH2 group. If they're only coupled to one adjacent group, it would be a triplet. However, if they're coupled to two different adjacent groups, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, so each CH2's Hs are split into triplets. But in the middle, if there's another CH2, then perhaps the middle CH2's Hs are split by two different adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each carbonyl is at the end, and the chain is longer. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Then, the central CH2 groups would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So the central Hs would be split into a triplet of triplets.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is needed.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is likely a triplet of triplets. Because each hydrogen is coupled with two sets of neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, it would lead to a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C produces product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group. Based on the IR data, product 1 is likely a diketone.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide forms product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid commonly used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. However, since product 1 is a diketone, product 2 is likely a conjugated enone formed via aldol condensation or a similar reaction.

3. **Ozonolysis and workup**: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. Thus, product 3 is expected to be a diketone or a compound with two carbonyl groups.

4. **NMR analysis of product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. If product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO, the central CH₂ group would be flanked by two carbonyls. Each hydrogen in the central CH₂ would couple with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if there is coupling with hydrogens on another adjacent group, the splitting pattern would become a triplet of triplets.

Given the coupling pattern described, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet of triplets** due to coupling with neighboring protons.

ANSWER: B
