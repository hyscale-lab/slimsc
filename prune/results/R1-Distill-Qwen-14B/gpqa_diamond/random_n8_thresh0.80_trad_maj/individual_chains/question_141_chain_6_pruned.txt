Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, wait. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, that might be a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, the way it's written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, let me think. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe that's 2-dimethyl-1-bromobenzene? Or perhaps the 'd' stands for something else. Oh wait, maybe it's
