Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution factor.

Wait, the initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The number of moles of acetic acid would be the initial concentration times the volume. Oh wait, but volume is in cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the new concentration is moles divided by total volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, and adding another 0.02 L makes 0.04 L. So yeah, 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 mol. Then 0.001 mol / 0.04 L is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. So let me calculate that.

The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So the moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point occurs when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let's tackle each part.

First, the 25% titration point. So that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. Since the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the diluted acetic acid.

Wait, but when you add some NaOH, it reacts with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a
