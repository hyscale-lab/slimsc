Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR part. It shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm^-1. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group somewhere.

Now, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break down each part:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents will affect the aromatic protons. The substitution pattern (ortho, meta, para) will determine the number of distinct aromatic proton environments. For di-substitution, possible scenarios are para (two equivalent sets, so one signal each?), but wait, no—if it's para, the two H on each ring position would be equivalent, so maybe only two signals? Or maybe more. Wait, if it's a 6-membered ring with two substituents, and it's di-substituted, like maybe two groups in the para positions. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the H adjacent to substituent A and substituent B. Or wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstitution. Then, the aromatic protons would be two sets of two H each. So each would have a singlet or some splitting. Hmm.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond, like in an ester group, maybe. Wait, esters have adjacent CH2 groups or maybe a CH connected to the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl protons are part of a conjugated system, like in a substituted ethylene group.

Wait, the ester group is usually O-CO-O, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, but no, the structure is R-O-CO-R. Wait, no, the ester functional group is RCOOR', right? So that's a carbonyl and an OR group. The vinyl protons might be from something else, maybe a double bond adjacent to the ester.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. Maybe one is on an aromatic ring (like a methyl substituent) and another is part of an ester group or another substituent. Or perhaps one is attached to an oxygen and another is somewhere else.

Wait, the problem states that there are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. So the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups. That's crucial.

So, putting this together. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, with substituents that include an ester group. Let me think about the possible structure.

Wait, di-substituted aromatic rings with ester groups. The substituents could be an ester group and another group, maybe a methyl group. Or perhaps both substituents are esters? No, that's less likely because the problem mentions an ester group in the compound. Alternatively, the substituents could be an ester and another group, maybe an alkoxy group or a methyl group.

Let me think about the possible structure. For a di-substituted benzene, substituents can be in para, ortho, or meta positions. Let's consider the substituents. One substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R (wait, no, ester is RCOOR'). So, for example, if the benzene ring has a COOCH2CH3 group attached, that's an ester substituent.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a side chain attached to the benzene ring. For example, an aryl ester or an
