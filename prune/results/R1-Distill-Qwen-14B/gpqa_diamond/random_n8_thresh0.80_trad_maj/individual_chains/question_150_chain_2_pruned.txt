Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 -m -x -p)/2. So here, n=8, m=9, x=1, p=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18 -11)/2 = 7/2=3.5. Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate: 2*8=16, plus 2 is 18. Then 18 minus 9 (H) is 9, minus 1 (O) is 8, minus 1 (N) is 7. Divide by 2 gives 3.5. Oh, that can't be. Maybe I messed up the formula. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, O and N each count as one each. So the formula is 2*8 + 2 -9 - (1 for O +1 for N) = 18-9-2=7. 7/2=3.5. Hmm. That suggests the molecule has a ring and a double bond or some other combination. Maybe a ring and an amide or something.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That region usually corresponds to aldehyde protons. So maybe there's an aldehyde group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe on adjacent carbons. Then, 6.98 ppm as a doublet (2H), 6.51 as another doublet (2H). Those are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests two phenyl groups attached somewhere.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet could be an enol proton, or maybe some kind of di- or poly-substituted aromatic, but more likely an enol. Enol protons tend to be broad because they exchange with water. So if there's an enol, then maybe the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group, like an aldehyde or ketone, but the aldehyde is already accounted for in the 9.72 ppm.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That could be two protons adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something with two benzene rings connected by a chain that includes an aldehyde, a carbonyl, and maybe an oxygen group.

Wait
