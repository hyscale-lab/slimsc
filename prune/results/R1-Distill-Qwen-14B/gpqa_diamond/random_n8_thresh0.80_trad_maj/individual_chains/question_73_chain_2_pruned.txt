Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity equations.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a relative speed and a total energy.

Wait, right, relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction. But wait, I think that when you're calculating the relative speed in relativity, it's not as straightforward as subtraction. Oh right, you need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So putting those into the formula, let's compute that.

Let me calculate v_rel. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging in: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Simplify numerator and denominator. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Wait, the total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut, right? Because energy is additive in relativity. But wait, each astronaut is moving, so their energies are their relativistic energies.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, I need to calculate their gamma and multiply by their respective masses.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 → 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) → 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² → approx 1.1547 * 3 = 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me be precise. Let me compute gamma2 exactly. 1/sqrt(0.75) is same as sqrt(4/3) because sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So 1.1547 times 3m c² is 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Wait, 2.5 plus 3.464 is 5.964. So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.
