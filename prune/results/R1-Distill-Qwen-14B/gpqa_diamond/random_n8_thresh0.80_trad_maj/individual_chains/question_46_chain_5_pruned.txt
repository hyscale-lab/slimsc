Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Wait, first, I should remember what racemic means. Racemic mixture is a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, so the molecule has a chiral center. I'll need to see if the starting material has any chiral centers. Let's draw 3-methylpent-1-ene.

So, pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-C(H)(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But the compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure should be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Wait, the formula would be C6H12? Wait, no, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a double bond at position 1 and a methyl branch at position 3. Let me write the structure properly.

Structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene: it's CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)-H? Wait, no. Let me number
