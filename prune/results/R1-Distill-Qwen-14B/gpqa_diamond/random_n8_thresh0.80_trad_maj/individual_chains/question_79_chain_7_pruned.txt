Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. We need to figure out what compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, first, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions. Oh wait, that's the compound used in the ring-opening of epoxides, right? So, maybe compound X is an epoxide that reacts with this base to undergo some kind of ring-opening. But wait, the question is about the starting material, X, so perhaps the reaction is an epoxide opening. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So, the product is formed from X reacting with this base.

Wait, understanding the reaction is key here. So, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, it's a bulky, strong, non-nucleophilic base. So, when an epoxide is treated with a base, it usually leads to ring-opening. But if the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is high (403 K is like 130°C), maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation leading to elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide, but the base here might not be doing that. Wait, the base would abstract a proton, leading to ring opening. So, if X is an epoxide, the base will open it. But then, how does that lead to the product's NMR?

Wait, but maybe the product is the ring-opened compound. So, the product would have an alkene or something else. Let me think about the NMR data given.

Looking at the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75
