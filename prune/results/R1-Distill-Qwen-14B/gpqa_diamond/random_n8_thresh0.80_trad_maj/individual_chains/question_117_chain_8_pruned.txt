Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry and has non-superimposable mirror images. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question lists four compounds, 1 to 4, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. Let's look at each.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl with substituents. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has two substituents. I'm thinking about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, maybe it's not chiral. But wait, the biphenyl with 1,1' connectivity—so the two phenyl rings are connected at position 1. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each. Wait, 2 is adjacent in one ring, 6 is opposite in the other? Hmm, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but the substituents are nitro and ester groups. Wait, the structure is 6,6' dinitro and 2,2' dicarboxylate. So each phenyl ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, maybe it's not chiral. But wait, if the biphenyl can rotate, does that affect symmetry? Wait, no, because the substituents are at 6 and 2. Oh wait, 6 is para to position 2 on the same ring. So each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2, but the other ring also has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So each ring is symmetrical. Wait, but the molecule as a whole—does it have a plane of symmetry? Because the two rings are connected at position 1, so if you look from that bridge, maybe the substituents are arranged symmetrically. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are in a way that makes the molecule have a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomerism. So maybe this
