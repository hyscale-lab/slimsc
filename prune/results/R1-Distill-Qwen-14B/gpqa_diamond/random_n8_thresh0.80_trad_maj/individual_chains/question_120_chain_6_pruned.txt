Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? The formula is something like distance equals 1 over parallax, but I'm not sure if it's in parsecs or something else. Oh wait, yes, the formula is d = 1 / plx, where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds.

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So that probably means their distribution in space is uniform in some way. But how does that translate into the number of stars we observe at a certain parallax range?

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away. But how does the number of stars per unit parallax change as we go to larger or smaller parallax values?

I remember that the volume of a sphere increases with the cube of its radius. Oh right, Volume = (4/3)πr³. So if the number of stars is uniform in space, the number of stars in a volume would depend on the volume. But wait, here we're looking at the number per unit parallax, not per volume. So maybe I need to relate parallax to volume somehow.

Let me think about how the number of stars per unit parallax interval (say, from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx. Since parallax is 1/d, a small change in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. Let's say I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + Δplx. What does that mean for the distance?

Well, the distance range would be from d = 1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + Δplx). So the change in distance is Δd = 1/(plx) - 1/(plx + Δplx). But maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many stars are within a certain shell at a distance d, and how that shell's thickness relates to parallax.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr multiplied by the number density of stars (since the stars are uniformly distributed in space). But we want the number per unit parallax. So maybe we can express dr in terms of parallax.

We know that plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, because differentiating d=1/plx gives dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dr = -dplx / plx². Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense. But since we're talking about a small interval, maybe we can take the absolute value for the thickness.

So substituting dr into the expression for the number of stars in the shell:

Number = 4π d² dr * n,

where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = dplx / plx²,

Number = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) * n.

So that's 4π n (dplx) * (1/plx^4).

Wait, but that's the number of stars per unit parallax interval (dplx) at a given plx. So the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.
