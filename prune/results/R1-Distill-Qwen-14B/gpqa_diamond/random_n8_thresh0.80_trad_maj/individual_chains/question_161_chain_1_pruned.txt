Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment—like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, right? The idea is to minimize gas molecules so that the electron beam doesn't get scattered too much. But even at that low pressure, some gas particles are still there. 

Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? So that depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecules, and P the pressure. 

But then Mike starts the electron beam. Oh, wait, the electron beam is a high-energy beam. I think when electrons hit the gas molecules, they can cause scattering. So the mean free path changes because the electrons are interacting with the gas. 

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path changed from λ1 to λ2. Why would that happen? Oh, because in the initial state, the mean free path was calculated based on the gas molecules colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are also colliding with the gas molecules, right? So the effective scattering is more than just gas-gas collisions. 

So the mean free path for electrons would be different. Wait, the mean free path Mike originally calculated (λ1) was for the gas molecules, but when the electron beam is on, the electrons are the ones moving and scattering off the gas. So the mean free path for the electrons would be shorter because they can scatter off the gas molecules more frequently.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The mean free path for gas molecules (λ1) was determined based on gas behavior. Then, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. So the mean free path for the electrons would be different. But the question states that Mike observed that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So the question is, what's the relationship between λ2 and λ1?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas. Oh, like the electrons could be causing ionization or heating. But the
