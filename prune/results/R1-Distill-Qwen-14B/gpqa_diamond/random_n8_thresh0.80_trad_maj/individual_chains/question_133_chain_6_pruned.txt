Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [PO₄³⁻], in the solution. The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, right. I remember that orthophosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The species present are H3PO4, H2PO4⁻, HPO4²⁻, and PO4³⁻. The Ka values help determine which species are predominant under certain conditions.

First, I need to calculate the concentrations of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O in the solution.

Let me start with KH₂PO₄. The molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. I have 1.00 grams of it. So moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Wait, let me compute that correctly. 1 divided by 136.09. Let me see: 136.09 is approximately 136. So 1/136 is about 0.0073529. But more accurately, using a calculator: 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Same for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Mass is 1.00 grams, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005608 mol.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 177.99 is roughly 178. So 1/178 is about 0.005618, so approximately 0.005608 mol.

Next, each of these salts dissociates in solution. Let's think about their dissociation.

KH₂PO₄ is a salt. When it dissociates, it gives K⁺, H₂PO₄⁻. So for each mole of KH₂PO₄, I get 1 mole of H₂PO₄⁻.

Similarly, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻. So each mole of Na₂HPO₄ gives 1 mole of HPO₄²⁻.

So, the initial concentrations in the solution would be:

[H₂PO₄⁻] = moles from KH₂PO4 / volume (L) = 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

[HPO₄²⁻] = moles from Na2HPO4 / 0.2 L = 0.005608 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02804 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Orthophosphate can shift between H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2− depending on the solution's pH. So, the presence of both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^
