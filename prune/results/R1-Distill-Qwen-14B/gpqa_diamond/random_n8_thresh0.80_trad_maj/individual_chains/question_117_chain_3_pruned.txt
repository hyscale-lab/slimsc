Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... that's when compounds have different configurations that make them non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So, these are also known as enantiomers. The presence of stereocenters is key for this, I think. Also, sometimes other factors like double bonds can contribute if they have E and Z isomerism, but I'm not sure if that leads to optical activity.

The question lists four different organic moieties, and I need to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds have two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on positions 2 and 6. Wait, does the substituent arrangement allow for any kind of stereoisomerism? Oh, I remember that if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not show optical isomerism. But in this case, the substituents are on 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Let me visualize it. So each phenyl ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Wait, the way the rings are connected could lead to some sort of stereoisomerism. Because the biphenyl structure can have the rings arranged in a way that the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides. Oh right, this could lead to cis-trans isomerism around the central single bond. But is that cis-trans (geometric isomerism) or does it relate to optical isomerism?

Wait, geometric isomerism is about spatial arrangement around double bonds (like E/Z) or in ring systems. For biphenyls, the rotation around the single bond can lead to different configurations. But in the case of 1,1'-biphenyl, can the substituents on each ring be arranged such that they create a chiral center or a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents on each ring create a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to enantiomers. Wait, in this case, each ring has two substituents: nitro and carboxylate. If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. But if they're on opposite positions, perhaps it's asymmetric.

Wait, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each phenyl ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Let me think about the structure. The two rings are connected at position 1. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So for each ring, the substituents are at positions that are para to each other? Or no, because 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are meta to each other. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 1 is where the biphenyl connects. So for each ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other (like 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock). So each ring has two substituents opposite each other. So looking at the two rings, the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but what if the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other create a chiral center?

Wait, no, the rings themselves aren't chiral. But perhaps the molecule as a whole could be chiral if it doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents create a situation where the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is arranged in such a way that the molecule has a center of chirality. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to check other options first and come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. Pro
