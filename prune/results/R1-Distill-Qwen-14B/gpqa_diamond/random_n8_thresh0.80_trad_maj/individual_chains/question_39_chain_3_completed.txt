Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle. Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The particles are only found between x=1 and x=3 when measured, and we need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding the particle. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since the question says that none were found outside x=1 and x=3, that means the probability of finding the particle between 1 and 3 must be 100%, right? Because all the particles are accounted for in that interval.

So the first step is to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1. Then solve for 'a'.

Let me write down the wave function ψ(x):
ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i

Wait, but wait a minute. That seems a bit odd. Because in most cases, the wave function is a combination of real and imaginary parts, but when you take the modulus squared, you have to consider both parts. Let me think about how to compute |ψ(x)|².

The modulus squared of a complex number ψ is ψ multiplied by its complex conjugate. So ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i, right? Because the complex conjugate changes the sign of the imaginary part.

So, |ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ]

Multiplying these out, it's like (A - B)(A + B) which is A² - B².

So that would be (a²/(1+x)) - (0.5i * 0.5i). Wait, but i squared is -1, so 0.5i * 0.5i = (0.25)(i²) = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

So putting it all together, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right because the modulus squared must be a positive real number, which it is, since (a²/(1+x)) is positive and 0.25 is positive. So the total is (a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25.

Wait, wait, that seems correct. So the probability density is a function of x: (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So the integral ∫ from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split that integral into two parts: the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C. So evaluating from 1 to 3: a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the sum of both integrals is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) → (0.5) / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931. So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of that. sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Calculated |ψ|² correctly? Yes: (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

2. Set the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|² dx =1.

3. Split into two integrals: correct.

4. First integral: a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2). Correct.

5. Second integral: 0.25*(2) = 0.5. Correct.

6. So a²*0.6931 + 0.5 =1 → a²= (0.5)/0.6931 ≈0.7213 → a≈0.849 → 0.85.

Yes, that seems correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the wave function of the particle, given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density of finding the particle is given by the modulus squared of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). Using the property \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \psi(x) \cdot \psi^*(x) \), where \( \psi^*(x) \) is the complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \), we compute:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \right) \cdot \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \right)
\]

Expanding this, we get:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability of finding the particle between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) is 1, as no particles are found outside this range. Thus, we set up the integral:

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \)

For the first integral, \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \), the antiderivative is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from 1 to 3 gives:

\[
a^2 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral, \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \), we compute:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining both results, the equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
