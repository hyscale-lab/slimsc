Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right?

Hmm, I think I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is often calculated using relativistic equations. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c), we can't use classical mechanics; we need to apply special relativity here.

The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula I remember is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

Gamma (γ) is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So let's write that down: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, plugging that in: v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216c². Subtracting that from c² gives 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, γ is 1/0.28. Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, but wait, no, I think I got that right. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So γ is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, but sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28? Wait, actually, no. Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Because (0.28)^2 is 0.0784. So yes, that part is correct.

So, gamma is about 3.5714. But wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me think: 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is 25/7. Let me calculate 25 ÷ 7. 7*3 is 21, 25-21=4. So 3 and 4/7, which is approximately 3.571
