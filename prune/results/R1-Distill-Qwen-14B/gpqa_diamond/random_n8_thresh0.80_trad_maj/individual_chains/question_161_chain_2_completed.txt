Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He's connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is that with such low pressure, there are very few gas molecules in the sample compartment. That makes sense because in a vacuum, the fewer the gas particles, the less scattering there is for the electron beam, right?

But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them. Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember that from my notes. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the cross-sectional area for collisions.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Instead of λ1, it's now λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that can't be the reason for the change. The question is asking what this means about λ2 compared to λ1.

Wait, what's the mean free path equation again? Oh right, the formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter of the gas molecules, and P is pressure. Alternatively, I've also seen it written as λ = (1)/(√2 * n * π * d²), where n is the number density. Because at the same temperature, if pressure changes, the mean free path changes.

But wait, in this scenario, the pressure in the sample compartment is already ultra-low. But when the electron beam is turned on, what changes? Oh, right, the electrons are moving at high speeds. The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, which is really high. That means the electrons have a lot of kinetic energy, so they're moving very fast.

I remember that when a gas is subjected to an electric field, especially a strong one, it can cause ionization. So, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize. Ionized gas molecules have a different behavior. They might become charged, which affects their movement and how they interact with the electron beam.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path? Well, if the gas is ionized, it's now a plasma. The mean free path in a plasma can be longer than in a neutral gas because the interactions are different. Or maybe because the electron beam itself is causing more ionization, which could either increase or decrease the effective pressure?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam somehow increases the effective pressure. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The beam's electrons are moving so fast that they might not contribute much to collisions. But the gas molecules are now being ionized, which changes their properties.

Wait, the mean free path in the presence of the electron beam could be affected by electron scattering. But Mike's observation is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. Hmm.

Wait another angle: the electron beam might cause more collisions between gas molecules. Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remains the same. So temperature isn't the factor here.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to scatter electrons, but the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves (not the electrons) depends on their movement. Wait, that's confusing. The mean free path lambda refers to how far a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. So, the presence of the electron beam might not directly affect the gas molecules' collisions with each other unless the beam's energy affects the gas's state.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam creates a current, which might cause the gas to become ionized. In that case, the gas becomes a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the particles are charged and might interact differently. Or perhaps because the ionization increases the number of effective collisions.

Wait, no, in a plasma, the mean free path can be shorter because the charged particles can interact more frequently. Or maybe it's longer because they're more likely to be deflected by the electric fields, leading to more scattering. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, it may become more transparent to electrons, but that's about electron scattering, not the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, no, the problem says that Mike is observing the mean free path based on electron scattering. Oh, wait, no, the question says that Mike is looking at the mean free path of the gas molecules concerning electron scattering. Or does it?

Wait the question says: "based on electron scattering with the gas molecules." So, he's measuring the mean free path of the gas molecules as determined by electron scattering. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules' mean free path as observed through scattering changes.

Hmm, but why would the mean free path change? The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(√2 n σ), where σ is the collision cross-section, and n is the number density. So if n or σ changes, λ changes.

But the pressure is the same before and after the beam is on, so n (number density) is the same. Unless the beam affects n somehow. For example, if the beam heats the gas, causing expansion, which would lower the pressure and increase the mean free path. But the question says the temperature is the same, so expansion due to heating isn't the case.

Alternatively, maybe the beam is causing ionization, which changes the effective cross-section. If the gas molecules are ionized, their cross-section for electron scattering might change. But wait, the mean free path λ is for the gas molecules colliding with each other, not with the electrons. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says that Mike determined the mean free path based on electron scattering. Maybe he's looking at how often the electrons scatter off the gas molecules. So when the beam is on, the electrons are interacting with the gas, and the mean free path λ2 refers to the electrons' mean free path in the gas.

Wait, no, the problem says that the mean free path was determined as λ1 by Mike, but when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2. Wait, perhaps the mean free path here refers to that of the electrons, not the gas molecules.

Wait, the question states: "mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state" is λ1. Then, upon initiating the electron beam, "he found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same."

Wait, but if the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1, and when the beam is on, the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ2. So it's about the gas molecules' mean free path.

But why would the presence of the electron beam affect the gas molecules' mean free path? Because the gas is in the same vacuum, same pressure, same temperature. Unless the electron beam is causing some sort of electric effect, such as ionization, which affects the gas.

Wait, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path could change. Because in a plasma, the mean free path can be longer if the ions and electrons don't collide as much as neutral gas molecules. Or maybe it's shorter because the ions are more mobile and have different collision dynamics.

Wait, but wait, in a plasma, the mean free path is generally longer than in neutral gas because the particles are more mobile and perhaps the collision rate is lower. Wait no, in a plasma, the ions and electrons can move more freely because the neutral molecules are not there to collide with them. But in this case, the gas is ionized, so perhaps the gas density decreases because ionized particles may have different behavior. Or maybe the number density (n) remains the same, but the effective cross-section changes because the ions have different sizes or charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become more ionized, and the cross-section for collisions between gas molecules changes. For example, if the gas is more ionized, the effective collision diameter might be larger or smaller.

Wait, let me think about the factors affecting the mean free path. At the same pressure and temperature, the mean free path is longer when the gas molecules are larger, or when the gas is less dense. So if the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, perhaps the ionized particles have larger effective diameters, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but when a gas becomes ionized, the number of particles (because each ionization splits a molecule into ion and electron) increases. If n (number density) increases, then the mean free path λ should decrease because λ is inversely proportional to n.

Wait, but in the problem, the pressure is already ultra-low. So the initial mean free path λ1 is large. When the electron beam is on, it causes ionization. So more particles are present. That would increase n, so λ should decrease. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1. That would mean λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But wait, wait a minute. The pressure is the same whether the beam is on or off because pressure is determined by the number of particles and volume, etc. Oh, but wait, no — when you ionize the gas, each ionization event produces more charged particles. So the number of particles (n) increases because each neutral gas molecule becomes two charged particles (ion and electron). So n would effectively double. Because one molecule becomes two particles.

So if the initial pressure is P = n k T, and if n doubles, then the pressure would also double. But the question says that the temperature is the same, so if P increases, the mean free path should decrease.

But wait, the pressure is measured by the number density of neutral gas molecules, or the total number of all particles (ions, electrons, etc.)? Hmm, pressure is a function of the total number of particles. So if ionization increases the number of particles, the pressure effectively increases, which would decrease the mean free path.

So in this case, when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized, leading to a higher effective pressure. Therefore, the mean free path λ would decrease. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but the initial pressure is already very low. So the initial mean free path λ1 is large. After ionization, the number of particles doubles, so the pressure effectively doubles. That would cause the mean free path to be λ = 1/(n), so if n doubles, λ becomes ½, so λ2 is smaller than λ1.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, another thought. What if the ionization changes the collision cross-section σ? For example, if the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section for collisions between gas molecules might change. If σ increases, then the mean free path λ would decrease. So even if n stays the same (unlikely, but for the sake of argument), λ would go down.

But in reality, n increases because of the ionization, making λ decrease more.

So putting it all together, λ2 is less than λ1. So the correct option is C.


The scenario involves a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr) with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. Mike determined the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum state as λ1. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a new mean free path, λ2, which deviated from λ1. The temperature remained constant throughout the experiment.

The mean free path (λ) is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \, n \, \sigma}
\]

where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, and \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section. At the same temperature and pressure, λ depends on \(n\) and \(\sigma\). Initially, in the ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is very low, resulting in a large λ1. When the electron beam is turned on, ionization occurs, converting neutral gas molecules into charged particles (ions and electrons). This ionization effectively doubles the number of particles in the system, increasing the number density \(n\). Since λ is inversely proportional to \(n\), the mean free path decreases as \(n\) increases.

Additionally, ionization may alter the collision cross-section \(\sigma\), potentially further reducing λ. Even if \(\sigma\) remains unchanged, the increase in \(n\) due to ionization is sufficient to cause a decrease in λ. Therefore, the mean free path λ2 observed when the electron beam is on is smaller than λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
