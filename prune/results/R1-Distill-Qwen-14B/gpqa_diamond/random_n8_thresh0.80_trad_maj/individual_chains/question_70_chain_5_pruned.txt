Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the reactions provided and see what each part tells me.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm not exactly sure what A and B are yet, but the product C being bright red makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, I remember that copper(II) sulfate is blue, but maybe it's something else... Oh, wait, sulfur is bright yellow, so maybe A is something else. Alternatively, could it be something like sulfur trioxide? No, that's a gas. Maybe C is a compound like SO3 or something else.

Wait, the next reaction says that C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. But wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen. Hmm.

Then, C reacting with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So when C (maybe an oxide or another compound) reacts with water, it forms two acids. Strong and weak. Wait, for example, if C is SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (a strong acid) and... wait, no, SO3 + H2O is H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But the problem says two different acids. Hmm, perhaps C is something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a sulfate, but that's more of a salt. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. Wait, sulfites reacting with water would form H2SO3, which is a weak acid. But that's only one acid. Hmm, maybe C is something else. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the reactions step by step.

First reaction: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C(s, bright red)
Second reaction: C(s) + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous)
Third reaction: C(s) + H2O → A(s) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Fourth reaction: D(g) reacts with B(g) in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Let me think about D reacting with B to form H, a solvent. Common solvents
