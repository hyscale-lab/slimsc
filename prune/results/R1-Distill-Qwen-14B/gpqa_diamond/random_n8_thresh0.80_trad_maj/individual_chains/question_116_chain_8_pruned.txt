Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A and ending up with Compound D, which we need to identify from the options given. The options are structures of cyclohex-enol derivatives with various substituents and stereochemistry.

Alright, let me break down the information piece by piece.

First, Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us about the number of protons. So, 6H in a triplet and 4H in a quartet. 

What kind of structure gives such a splitting? Triplets and quartets usually come from neighboring protons. For the triplet with 6H, maybe they're equivalent and each is next to two protons. Similarly, the quartet with 4H would each be next to three protons. Wait, or maybe it's the other way around? No, because the splitting depends on the number of neighboring H's. So, a triplet implies each H is adjacent to two others. So, perhaps the 6H are from two equivalent CH3 groups, each next to a CH2. Because a triplet for a CH3 would come from coupling with two Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, let's think: If you have a CH2CH2CH3 structure, the end CH3 would have a triplet because the adjacent CH2 has two H's. So, in that case, each CH3 would be a triplet. If there are two such groups, the integration would be 6H, each in a triplet.

Similarly, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each H is next to three H's. So, perhaps each of these two H's is part of a CH2 group next to a CH3. Wait, no, the quartet would be for a CH2 group next to a CH group. Oh, wait, maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2, which is adjacent to a CH3. So, like (CH2)2CH3. But wait, the splitting would be a quartet for each H in the middle CH2 group. Because each of those H's is next to two H's on one side and two on the other? Wait, no, the splitting is determined by the neighboring groups. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group next to a CH3. So, each H in the CH2 is next to three H's (from the CH3). So that would give a quartet. Wait, no, a CH2 next to a CH3 has each H in the CH2 adjacent to three H's (from the CH3). So the splitting would be a quartet for each H in the CH2. Because each H in CH2 is next to three H's on the adjacent C.

So, in this case, the quartet (4H) would come from two CH2 groups each with two H's, each adjacent to a CH3. But wait, that would mean each CH2 is adjacent to a CH3, so their H's would be a quartet. So if there are two CH2 groups each next to a CH3, that would account for 4H in a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is two ethyl groups. So, two -CH2CH2CH3 groups. But wait, that would have each CH3 as triplet (from adjacent CH2), and the CH2 next to CH3 would be a quartet. But wait, in that case, each CH2 near CH3 would be a quartet. So for two ethyl groups, each would have a quartet for the CH2, but that's 4H in total. So that would explain the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then the triplet for 6H would be the two CH3 groups of the ethyls.

So putting this together, Compound A is likely diethyl something. Diethyl ether? No, because that would have more signals,
