Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in the solution.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can dissociate. The phosphate ions in solution can be H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. So in this case, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate would be H3PO4, but perhaps the term here refers to the phosphate ions, maybe. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- or HPO4^2-.

Wait, the options are in the order of 10^-7 M, so it's likely that it's the concentration of HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm.

The solution contains two forms of phosphate: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, let me think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4). So, each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, how do these ions behave in solution?

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

But in this case, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. Wait, but that's a bit confusing because they can interconvert. So, the system will be in equilibrium between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Let me think: H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since it's Ka1), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (since that's Ka2). So, in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- which can act as a buffer between the second dissociation step.

So, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-? Or perhaps orthophosphate refers to another form. Hmm. Wait, another thought: orthophosphate is HPO4^2- isn't it? Because ortho- refers to the second dissociation step. Alternatively, maybe it's the fully deprotonated form, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question states, 'what is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?'. Orthophosphate ions could be HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. The first dissociation gives H2PO4^- (which is dihydrogen phosphate), second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and third gives PO4^3- (phosphate). So, orthophosphate might refer to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-, but I'm not exactly certain.

But perhaps the problem is looking for the concentration of PO4^3-? Or maybe HPO4^2-.

Wait, looking at the options, they are all around 1e-7 M. The Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so maybe that's relevant here. Perhaps we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species. So, the total phosphate comes from both.

Wait, no, actually, the total phosphate is the sum of all phosphate species. But in this problem, since we're adding both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate. Let me think, perhaps orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- form. Because ortho- usually refers to the second position in a molecule. So, in H3PO4, the first hydrogen is alpha, the second is beta, etc. So, HPO4^2- is the orthophosphate ion.

So, if the question is asking for HPO4^2-, which is what Na2HPO4·2H2O provides, then perhaps we can calculate its concentration directly, considering the dissociation equilibrium.

But wait, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O, but some of it might convert into PO4^3- or back into H2PO4^- depending on the pH.

Wait, no, because the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in equilibrium with each other. So, the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^2-) will depend on the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, the problem statement says 'orthophosphate ions' and the options are around 1e-7, which is much lower than the concentrations of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

So, first, let me calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution.

The volume is 200 mL, so 0.2 L.

1.00 g of KH2PO4: Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.

Molarity of KH2PO4 is (1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol) / 0.2 L.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol, then /0.2 L.

Let me compute those.

First, compute moles for each.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007337 mol.

Moles of Na2
