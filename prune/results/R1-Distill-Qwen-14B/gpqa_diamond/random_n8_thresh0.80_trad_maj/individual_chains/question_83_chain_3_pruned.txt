Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, let me read the problem again. So, we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm. First, I need to think about what happens during the titration. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Okay, so the first step is to find out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because we diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. The moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the new concentration is moles / new volume. 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, so the concentration becomes 0.025 M after dilution.

But wait, during the titration, we add NaOH. So the initial concentration of the acid solution is 0.025 M. Now, when we start titrating, each drop of NaOH will react with the acetic acid. 

The next part is about the 25% titration. That means we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to calculate how much NaOH is needed for equivalence first.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol (from earlier). So, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. 

So, the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. 

Wait, but wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³. When we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³. 

So, for the 25% titration point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let me think about the reaction. The reaction is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH. So, if 25% of the NaOH needed is added, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate.

So, let's model this. Let me write down the initial concentrations.

After dilution, the solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. When we add NaOH, some of it reacts. Let's denote the volume of NaOH added as V. At 25%, V is 2.5 cm³. 

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of moles. Let's calculate moles.

Original moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.0002
