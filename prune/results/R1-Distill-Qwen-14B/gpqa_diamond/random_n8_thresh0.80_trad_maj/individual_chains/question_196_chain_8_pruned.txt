Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But this is a relativistic case, so I guess I need to consider relativistic effects.

The problem states it's 1-dimensional with mass m, maximum amplitude A, and obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. The question is about the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed comes from when all the potential energy (1/2 k A^2) is converted to kinetic energy (1/2 m v_max^2). So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the relativistic case, so option C isn't the right answer here.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's total energy. The total energy of the oscillator would include both the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy from the spring.

The total energy E at maximum displacement (x=A) would be all potential, right? Because the kinetic energy is zero there. So E = (1/2)k A², but wait, in relativity, the energy might be different. Or maybe I need to think in terms of relativistic equations.

Wait, another approach: the relativistic energy for a harmonic oscillator combines the rest mass energy and the oscillation energy. Maybe the energy is quantized, but since it's a classical problem, I don't think quantization applies here. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can model it using the relativistic equation of motion. The force is F = -kx, so using F = dp/dt, where p is relativistic momentum.

In relativity, the momentum p is gamma m v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So F = d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

Wait, but x is the position, which in SHM is A cos(ωt + φ). But at maximum speed, the system is at the equilibrium position, so x=0, but then velocity is maximum. Hmm, maybe that's a different point. Wait, no, maximum velocity occurs when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point, x=0, moving fastest. At x=A, the velocity is zero. So the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but in relativistic terms.

Wait, but in the relativistic scenario, the energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic. Let me think about energy conservation.

The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy. But wait, the potential energy of the spring is (1/2)k A², and at maximum speed, all of that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But relativistically, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma -1)mc².

So, setting the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But wait, when the mass is at x=0, all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic. So:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

Rearranging this, I can solve for gamma.

Gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Take reciprocal:

(1 - v²/c²) = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the total energy as the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but also the potential energy.

Wait, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy (TME) is (1/2)k A², which is the sum of KE and PE. In relativistic case, perhaps the TME includes relativistic KE and the classical PE.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach: in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion is F = -k x = d p/dt, where p is relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v.

So F = d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But for SHM, x = A cos (ω t + φ). Let's assume the system is at rest at t=0 except for the initial displacement. At x = A, velocity is zero, so maximum potential energy. Then as it moves towards equilibrium, x decreases and velocity increases.

At the equilibrium point x=0, the velocity is maximum. Let's calculate the velocity there.

But I'm not sure how to integrate this differential equation. Maybe an alternative approach is to look for expressions of velocity in relativistic harmonic oscillators.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic plus potential energy. But in the maximum speed case, all potential energy is converted into kinetic. So,

Total energy E =
