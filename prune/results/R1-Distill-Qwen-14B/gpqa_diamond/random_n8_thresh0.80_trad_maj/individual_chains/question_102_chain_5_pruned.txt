Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher is trying to understand their developmental fate. The setup involves creating a bicistronic vector with specific constructs, and then using Cre-recombinase to induce expression. But when they look for GFP under the microscope, there's no green signal. I need to figure out why that is.

Let me go through the details again. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in the same transcript but under separate promoters? Or maybe it's using internal ribosome entry sites or something. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element, so IRES probably drives the second ORF, the receptor.

Looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, right, these are different loxP sites. So, when Cre is present, it recombines and deletes the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. 

So, the ligand is at the 5' end, followed by a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. Receptor is at the 3', preceded by an IRES, and then a lox2272 stop cassette before eGFP.

Wait, but the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So if you have Cre, it would delete the stop cassettes. But the setup is that the mouse is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So the Cre should be active in those cells, causing the stop cassettes to be removed, allowing expression of the ligand and receptor.

The question is about Western blot and fluorescence. After transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. I'm assuming that in the Western, they didn't see the expected bands for ligand and receptor. But wait, the question says that the mouse model was made, and they crossed them to SOX10-Cre. So, in the offspring, the Cre would be active in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes perhaps. But when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, the vector's design: when Cre is active, it deletes the stop cassettes. So for the ligand, the loxP-stop-loxP would be deleted, so ligand is expressed with mCherry. For the receptor, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 would be deleted, allowing the receptor to be expressed with eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor should be detected with an eGFP tag.

But in the mouse, after crossing, they don't see eGFP. So why isn't the receptor-eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct is in the same cell, so why would that matter for expression? Maybe if the ligand is secreted and acts on another cell, but in this case, it's the same cell. Not sure if this affects the expression though.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't transported to the cell surface, maybe it's retained in the Golgi. But then, the eGFP would not fluoresce because it's not at the cell surface. But if the construct is designed correctly, the eGFP should be on the receptor. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is being mislocalized.

Option C: Enhancer for expression
