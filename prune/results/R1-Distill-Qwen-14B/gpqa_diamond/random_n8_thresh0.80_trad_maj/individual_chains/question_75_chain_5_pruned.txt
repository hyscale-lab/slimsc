Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and are trying to express the protein but are failing. The question is why they can't overexpress the protein.

The construct's plus strand sequence is provided, and the problem is in the sequence. Let's look for possible issues.

First, I recall that adding a tag like HA (hemagglutinin) is usually done at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with the HA tag, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the DNA sequence, I should check for any issues that might prevent proper translation. Possible issues could be a premature stop codon, incorrect reading frame, or issues with the start codon.

The first part of the sequence is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT... So ATG is the start codon, which is correct (methionine). Then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine, GAT is aspartic acid, GTT is valine. That seems fine.

Wait, but I'm looking for anything that might cause translation to stop early. Stop codons in the mRNA are UAA, UAG, UGA. But in the DNA, these would be TAA, TAG, TGA. So looking for any TAA, TAG, TGA in the coding sequence.

Looking through the provided DNA sequence, let me scan for those:

Looking for TAA: Let's see. Let me go through the sequence in triplets.

The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Oh wait, here's TGA in the DNA. DNA is double-stranded, so the mRNA is complementary. So the DNA sequence at that point is TGA, which in mRNA would be UCA. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the DNA's template strand. So the mRNA is built using the coding (plus) strand's complement. Wait, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA except T becomes U.

Wait, no. The coding strand is the same sense as mRNA, except that mRNA is made from the template (antisense) strand. So the coding strand has ATG as the start, same as mRNA.

So if a coding sequence has a TGA in the DNA, that's part of the coding strand. So in mRNA, it would be UGA, which is a stop codon. So if the DNA has a TGA, the mRNA will have a UGA, which is a stop codon.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, let's see:

Looking through the sequence for TGA (DNA), which would be a stop codon in the mRNA.

Looking in the provided sequence: let's check. I'll go through the DNA sequence in triplets.
