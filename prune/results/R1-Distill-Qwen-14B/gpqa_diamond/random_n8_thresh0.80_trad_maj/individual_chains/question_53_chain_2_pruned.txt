Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The key clues are the IR and NMR spectra. Let's break down what each part tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. So the compound must have an ester functional group, which means it's probably something like an aryl ester or an alkoxy ester, but given it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, I'm thinking it's attached to the ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals in total. Let me list them:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm, a di-substituted benzene usually has two distinct sets of aromatic protons, especially if the substituents are deactivating and para to each other or perhaps ortho. Wait, no, wait. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. For example:

- If the substituents are para, each set would have two equivalent Hs, giving two signals (each as a doublet? Or maybe a singlet if the coupling is complex... Wait, maybe not. Let me think. In para substitution, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Each set would show as a singlet if the substituents are strong deshielders but maybe not, depends on the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps if the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into two signals, like each substituent has different electronic environments. Wait, but in di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are para, the two H environments are equivalent, right? No, wait. If substituents are in para positions, then the ring has two sets of equivalent H: the two H adjacent to each substituent. Wait, no, that's not right. Let's think of toluene. Toluene is a mono-substituted benzene, but if it's di-substituted para, like p-xylene, then each substituent is at opposite positions. In that case, the H's ortho to each substituent are equivalent, so you'd only have one set of aromatic protons. But wait, the
