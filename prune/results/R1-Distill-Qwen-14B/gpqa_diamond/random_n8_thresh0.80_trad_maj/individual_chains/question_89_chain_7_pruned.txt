Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. 

IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or ester. The NMR has signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). 

Wait, I think when dibrominated compounds react with a strong base like KOH, it's likely a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. But since it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's forming an epoxide? Or perhaps an elimination to form an alkene? Or wait, another possibility: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in an elimination, it might form an ether via an SN2 mechanism. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a rigid molecule. 

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if each bromine is on adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination would form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe a double elimination to form a diene? Or perhaps it's an E2 reaction, but since it's a dihalide, maybe two E2 eliminations occur.

Wait, but another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoalkanes) are treated with a strong base, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal, it's 1,3. So maybe that's not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines, which aren't present here.

Wait, another possibility: the base (KOH) could abstract a proton leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Wait, but how? Alternatively, considering that adamantane has a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. The bromines are on adjacent bridgehead positions. When treated with KOH, maybe it's undergoing a ring-opening or some kind of elimination leading to a ketone.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹), which is a strong indication of a ketone. So product 1 must be a ketone. How does 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Oh wait, maybe it's a dielimination. Like, two E2 reactions happening. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. If each bridgehead loses a Br and a proton, perhaps forming a double bond between the two bridgeheads, but wait, that might not be feasible due to the structure of adamantane. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a ketone via a different process.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution leading to a structure where two OH groups form, but that
