Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR and NMR spectra give some clues, so I'll need to piece that together.

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which usually shows up around 1740 cm⁻¹. So the molecule must have an ester functional group. Ester groups are formed from the reaction of an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, right? So the structure probably includes something like R-O-CO-R'.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The signals are as follows: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two -CH3 groups. No -CH2 signals. So, let's think about what this implies.

A di-substituted benzene means there are two substituents on the ring. The protons on the ring would be split depending on their positions. If the substituents are in the para position (1,4), the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, but the question says six signals in total, with two aromatic H's. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, aromatic protons: two signals. So that suggests that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are para, the ring has two equivalent protons (the ortho positions) and another two equivalent (the meta positions?), but wait no. Wait, if it's para, the ring should have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: in para substitution, the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs. For example, if two substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions, then the ortho positions (2 and 6) are equivalent, and the meta positions (3 and 5) are equivalent. So that would give two signals for the aromatic Hs. That fits the NMR description.

But wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H. So that might indicate that the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two distinct sets of equivalent Hs. So perhaps para substituents.

Then, the vinyl protons. The NMR shows two signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are typically part of an alkene, so maybe the molecule has an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Let's consider a structure like benzene with an ester substituent and another substituent that might be a vinyl group.

Wait, but another substituent on the benzene. So the di-substituted benzene has two groups: an ester and another group that could be a vinyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that also includes a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR also shows two -CH3 signals. So two different methyl groups. So the molecule must have two different methyl groups attached.

Wait, putting this together. Let me think of the structure. Maybe the benzene ring has an ester group and another substituent. The ester could be something like a methoxy ester, but wait, no. Let me think. The ester is R-O-CO-R'. Maybe the R is a methyl group and R' is another group.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose the benzene has an ester group as a substituent. For example, perhaps something like a phenyl ester. But then, what about the other substituent?

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups, so perhaps the ester is attached to a group that has two methyl groups. For example, maybe the ester is from a diethyl group or something. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group substituted with something else. Let me think of a possible structure: perhaps the benzene has an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl substituent which is part of another group with methyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ester groups but that might not make sense since it's di-substituted. Wait, no, the ester would be a single substituent.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.

The degrees of unsaturation can help. For a benzene ring, we have 4 degrees (since benzene has three double bonds and a ring, total 4). So the formula will have at least four degrees.

The ester group has a double bond in the carbonyl, so that's another degree. If the molecule has a vinyl group (another double bond), that's another degree. So let's calculate.

For the formula C11H14O2: the formula would be C11H14O2. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or a double bond. So for a formula CnHmOx, the degrees of unsaturation are (2n +2 - m - x*(2-0))/2. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2? Wait, wait, the correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, but in this case, O doesn't contribute as X. So each O is treated as a substituent but doesn't add to the degrees of unsaturation beyond the structure. Wait, no, oxygen doesn't contribute to degrees of unsaturation. So for each molecule, degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Let me calculate for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. C=11, H=14.

DOU = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24 -14)/2 =10/2=5.

Option B: C12H14O2. (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=12/2=6.

Option C: C12H12O2. (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=14/2=7.

Option D: C11H12O2. (2*11+2 -12)/2=(24-12)/2=12/2=6.

Wait, the benzene ring has 4 DOU (3 double bonds and a ring, but each double bond is a DOU, so 3 for double bonds plus 1 for the ring, total 4). The ester group (C=O) adds another DOU, so that's 5. So our molecule must have at least 5 DOU. If any substituent has a double bond (like a vinyl group), that's another DOU. So for the total, if the molecule has a benzene ring (4), ester (1), and a vinyl group (1), that's 6 DOU. Which would mean the formula would have 6 DOU.

Looking at the options, which have 5 or 6 or 7.

Option A: 5 DOU. So 4 (benzene) + 1 (ester) =5. That would not include a vinyl group. But the NMR says there are vinyl protons, so the molecule must have at least one double bond (vinyl group), making DOU 5 +1=6. So the formula must have 6 DOU.

Looking at the options, which have 6 DOU: options B and D. Because:

Option B: C12H14O2 → DOU=6.

Option D: C11H12O2 → DOU=6.

So the correct formula must be either B or D.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl protons. So the molecule must have a vinyl group. So the molecule has a benzene ring (4), ester (1), and a vinyl group (1), totaling 6 DOU. So the formula must have 6 DOU.

Now, let's think about the structure again. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group. Let's think of a structure where the benzene has two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent. For example, maybe the benzene is attached to an ester group which is connected to a vinyl group, which in turn is connected to another group.

Wait, another thought: the NMR has two signals for methyl groups. So there are two different
