Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR can give a lot of structural info, so I should start there.

So, in proton NMR, splitting patterns tell us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is split into two neighboring groups. Wait, actually, the number of peaks in a multiplet corresponds to the number of neighboring protons plus one. Oh, wait, no, the splitting is due to neighboring (adjacent) protons. So, for example, a triplet would mean each proton is next to two others. Wait, noâ€”wait, think again. Each proton's signal is split by neighboring non-equivalent protons. The number of peaks is n+1, where n is the number of neighboring equivalent protons. So a triplet (three peaks) would mean two neighboring protons. Because 2+1=3.

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. So those 6 hydrogens are in an environment where each is next to two others. Wait, but 6H is a lot. Maybe they are from two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to something. For example, if you have two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon, each CH3 would be next to each other. Wait, but in ethyl groups, maybe?

Wait, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. 4H suggests maybe a CH2CH2 group, but more likely, two CH2 groups. Because if you have a quartet, that would mean each H is next to three others. Wait, no, quartet is four peaks, which comes from three neighboring Hs. So if each H is next to three Hs, that would imply a -CH2CH2- structure. Because each CH2 would be next to another CH2 group. So for example, in an ethyl group, the -CH2CH3 would have the triplet and quartet.

Wait, let me think. For an ethyl group, the CH3 group would be a triplet because each H is next to two Hs from the adjacent CH2. And the CH2 would be a quartet
