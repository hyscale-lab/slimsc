Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X, with the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify Compound X from the options A to D.

Hmm, right. So the reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I remember that this compound is a base, often used in deprotonation reactions. It's a strong, bulky base, so maybe it's an epoxide ring-opening reaction? Oh wait, if the solvent is nonpolar, perhaps it's a ring-opening under certain conditions.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So the product's structure can be deduced from the NMR data, and I can compare it to the possible products from each option.

Let me think about what each option is. Let's list them:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
Option D: 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, oxirane is another name for an epoxide. So all the options are epoxides with some substituents.

The reaction is probably opening the epoxide. Wait, but wait. The product's NMR is given, and the question is about the starting compound, X. So the product is formed after the reaction, which is the ring-opening of X with that base.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So when it's in a nonpolar solvent and at high temperature, maybe it's deprotonating something or causing an elimination.

Alternatively, in some cases, it's used for epoxide ring-opening. But if the solvent is nonpolar, maybe it's more about a transannular ring-opening. Wait, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the product's NMR has specific signals. Let me look at the 1H NMR data:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So two singlet triplets: each 3H, probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have neighboring Hs. Then four aromatic signals. Let's think: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5 perhaps? Or maybe a substituent at position 4 with another substituent in a position that causes coupling.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted styrene or something. Let me think about the structure. Alternatively, a biphenyl structure? Or maybe a conjugated diene with substituents.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

21.3 (1C, s) – that's a methyl group attached to something that's de-shielded? 28.4 (1C, s) – another methyl.

The rest are carbons in the aromatic region. 126.9 (2C, s) – maybe two carbons in a symmetric position. 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C). Wait, 141.5 and 144.1 are probably sp2 carbons attached to something else, maybe carbonyl groups or part of a ring.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl? Because in the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. So that's a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something. But 197 is pretty high, so perhaps a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes are around 190-205, but 197 could fit. Alternatively, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but the product came from an epoxide ring-opening. So, if X is an epoxide, reacting with a base would cause ring-opening. Let me think about that. The reaction could be acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed. Since the base is strong, maybe it's a base-induced ring-opening.

In base-induced opening of epoxides, the nucleophile (if any) would attack the less substituted epoxide carbon. Alternatively, in some cases, without a strong nucleophile, maybe it's an elimination? Hmm, but the product here has a carbonyl group, which suggests that perhaps the ring opened and formed a carbonyl, like in an elimination.

Wait, let me think: when an epoxide ring opens under basic conditions, but without a strong nucleophile, maybe it can undergo an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that's more common in cyclic ethers under acidic conditions, like the acid-catalyzed opening where a carbonyl might form.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a conjugated system, and upon ring-opening, a conjugated carbonyl is formed.

Let me think about the product structure.

So the product's 1H NMR shows two methyl singlets, maybe two CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't allow protons to be split, like being attached to a quaternary carbon or in a symmetric position. The aromatic signals suggest a benzene ring with substituents. Let me count the aromatic Hs.

In 1H NMR, 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). So that's 1+2+1+2 =6 H. So a benzene ring with four substituents? No, wait, each doublet might indicate coupling with one adjacent proton. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents in the ortho positions as well.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product
