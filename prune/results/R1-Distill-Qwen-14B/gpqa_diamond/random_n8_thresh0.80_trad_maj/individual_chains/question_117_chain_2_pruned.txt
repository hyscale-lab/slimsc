Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember optical isomerism is when a compound has the ability to rotate plane-polarized light, meaning it's chiral. Chiral compounds have a carbon with four different substituents, right? So, I need to check each compound for that.

Let me go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents on each ring are at the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, so the central carbon here is the one connecting the two benzene rings. But in a biphenyl structure, the single bond allows for rotation unless there are substituents that prevent free rotation. Oh wait, if the substituents are on each ring such that the two rings are not symmetrical, then maybe there's a possibility of atropisomerism. Atropisomers are a type of stereoisomer where rotation around a bond is hindered. So if the substituents are in positions that make rotation difficult, there could be enantiomers. For example, in 1,2-diphenylethane, if the two phenyl groups are on adjacent carbons, rotation is hindered and atropisomerism occurs. So in this case, the substituents are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, the 6 and 2 positions are meta to each other on each ring. Hmm, but the central bond is between the two benzene rings. If the substituents are on the same side, maybe the molecule can't rotate freely. So this compound could have enantiomers, so it shows optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is like O=C-OCH3 attached to CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon with the OH is the second carbon. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would make the structure CH2(OH)CH2COO-? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it.

The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is the conjugate base of propanoic acid, so it's CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon in the middle (second
