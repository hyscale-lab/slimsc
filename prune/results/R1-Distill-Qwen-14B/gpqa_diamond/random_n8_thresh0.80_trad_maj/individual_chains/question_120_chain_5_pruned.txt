Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of p has a distance d = 1/p. So as p increases, the distance decreases.

Now, stars are uniformly distributed in space. Wait, no, the question states that they are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean uniformly in terms of distance or just on the celestial sphere? Hmm, the wording says "uniformly distributed in the sky." I think that might imply that they're spread out uniformly in all directions, but I'm not sure if it's uniform in density or just scattered. Wait, maybe it's a uniform density in 3D space, which would mean that the number density of stars is constant.

So, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density n is constant. Now, how do we find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per unit p)? So we're looking for N, the number of stars in a thin shell with a parallax between p and p + dp.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. So when you have a parallax p, the distance d is 1/p. So a small change in p, dp, corresponds to a change in distance. Let's think about the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr.

The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dr. But since dr is a function of dp, we need to relate dr to dp. Because d = 1/p, so dr/dp = derivative of 1/p w.r. to p. Let's compute that. dr/dp is -1/p². So dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but since we're dealing with absolute volumes, perhaps the negative won't matter. Or maybe I should take the absolute value.

So, the volume element in terms of p would be:

dV = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp )?

Wait, let me compute that. d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². dr is (1/p²) dp, but I think the negative is just about direction, so when considering small increments, the volume would be positive, so maybe I can ignore the sign.

So, dV = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me correct this. dr is the change in distance, and since p = 1/d, when p increases, d decreases. So, if I have a shell at distance d, what is the change in d for a small change in p?

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of p. Let's think about it.

The distance to a star with parallax p is d = 1/p. The volume of a spherical shell between d and d + dr is 4πd² dr. But dr is a function of dp. So, from p to p + dp, the distance goes from d=1/p to d=1/(p+dp). Let me approximate for small dp.

So, d = 1/p, and when p changes by dp, d changes by dr = -1/(p²) dp. So, dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But when considering the thickness of the shell, we take the absolute value, so dr = (1/p²) |dp|.

So the volume of the shell at distance d is 4πd² dr = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Because d = 1/p, so d² is 1/p². So the volume becomes 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that would make the volume proportional to 1/p^4. But that seems a bit off. Because, I thought that the number of stars would depend on the volume, but if the number density is n (constant), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * dV.

So N = n * dV = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is asking about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, it's N/(dp) = 4π n (1/p^4). So the number per unit p would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but that would imply that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with p^4. But that doesn't make sense because higher parallax (lower distance) would have more stars, right? Wait, because if you're closer, you can see more stars in a given parallax range. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Let's imagine that we're considering stars at a certain parallax p. The number of stars per unit parallax (like per 1 arcsecond) would be how many are there in that p to p+1 range.

But if the number density n is constant, then the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n*dV. So, the number per unit p would be N = n * (4π (1/p^4) dp ) / dp ) = 4π n / p^4.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit parallax (like per arcsecond) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because higher parallax (nearby stars) should have more stars, since you can see more of them. For example, in the nearest parsecs, you have more stars in a given parallax range. So for small
