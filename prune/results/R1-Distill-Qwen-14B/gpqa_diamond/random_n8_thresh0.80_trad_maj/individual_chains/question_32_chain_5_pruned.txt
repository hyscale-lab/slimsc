Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy needed for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. I need to find the energy of the RHIC that achieves this. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is typically given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes people mix up total energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, wait. In relativity, especially for high speeds, the energy is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. But I'm a bit confused about whether the problem is asking for kinetic energy or total energy.

Wait, the options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So probably, it's the total energy they're asking for. Because the kinetic energy would be (gamma -1)mc², while the total energy is gamma * mc².

So, first, I need to calculate the relativistic gamma factor for v = 0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.96 * 0.96. Let me compute 0.96 * 0.96:

0.96 * 0.96 = (1 - 0.04)^2 = 1 - 0.08 + 0.0016 = 0.9216. So yes, correct.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, wait, 1/0.28 is actually 3.5714... because 0.28 * 3.5714 is approximately 1. Let me check 0.28 * 3.5714:

0.28 * 3 = 0.84; 0.28 * 0.5714 ≈ 0.28 * 0.57 is about 0.1596. So 0.84 + 0.1596 = 0.9996, almost 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, what's the mass of Li-6? I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Because each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 u. So Li-6 has 6 nucleons, so 6 u.

But wait, the exact mass might be a bit less because of binding energy, but for the sake of this problem, probably taking it as 6 u is fine.

So, the rest mass energy is m*c², where m is 6 u.

But what is 1 u in GeV? I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV, which is 0.9315 GeV.

So, m*c²
