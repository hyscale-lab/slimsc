Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again: A light beam is propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D, with B being 1, which I think is the speed of light in a vacuum. Hmm, interesting.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well but through the moving glass. I'm a bit confused about how the motion of the medium (glass) affects the speed of light in that medium.

I remember from my studies that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, it can affect the observed speed of light in that medium. But wait, according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the observer's motion or the medium's motion. But this isn't a vacuum; it's glass. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium, v_medium = c/n.

But now, the glass is moving. So the question is about how the relative speed is perceived in the lab. Let me think about this. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But from the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, velocity addition in relativity comes into play here. Oh right, the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed observed in the lab.

The formula for velocity addition is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/cÂ²). Wait, but wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. Let me think about the directions. The glass is moving towards the observer at
