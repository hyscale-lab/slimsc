Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is being diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate these two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when it's titrated with NaOH, a strong base, it will form its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-), in a neutralization reaction. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

First, let's find the initial concentration after dilution. The original solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

Wait, to find the new concentration, I should use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me plug in the numbers: M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = (1) / (40) = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, 0.05 times 20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed will depend on the moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Wait, wait, no, 40 cm³ is 0.04 L? Wait, no, 1 cm³ is 1 mL, 10 cm³ is 0.01 L. So 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles acetic acid. Correct.

Wait, and the NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed to reach equivalence can be calculated by moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. 

But the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of
