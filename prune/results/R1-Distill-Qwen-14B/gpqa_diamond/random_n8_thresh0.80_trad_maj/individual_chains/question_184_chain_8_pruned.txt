Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

First, I need to understand the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw its structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). Wait, I think I might be mixing up the positions. Wait, wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering is arbitrary, but in this case, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So in order, it's ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, actually, benzene is symmetric, so the numbers can be assigned based on the substituents. But for the synthesis, the order of adding groups matters because of directing effects.

So, the substituents are three: ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2). Each of these is a meta director, ortho/para director, or something else.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an ether), which is an ortho/para director. Nitro is a deactivating group (meta director), and tert-butyl is a bulky activating group (ortho/para, but more likely para because of steric hindrance, making it a strong para director).

Wait, but wait: the tert-butyl group is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and is an ortho/para director, but being bulky, it may direct more towards the para position because the ortho positions are crowded.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order in which they are added matters because each group directs the next substitution.

So the target has three substituents, but I'm starting with benzene, which has none. So the first
