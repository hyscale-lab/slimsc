Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis—right, that's the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So it's a catalyst that helps in breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh wait, wait. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pent chain has five carbons. The double bond starts at carbon 1, so it's 1,2 double bond. Carbon 3 has a methyl branch.

So structure would be CH₂=CH-C(H)(CH₂CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let's count: pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So actually, it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Hmm, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of structure more carefully.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no,
