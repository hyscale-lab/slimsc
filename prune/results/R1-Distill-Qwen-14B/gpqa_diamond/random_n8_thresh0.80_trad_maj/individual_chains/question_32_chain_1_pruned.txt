Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li with 3 neutrons... Well, Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, that would make the mass number 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. So X is Li-6.

Now, I'm supposed to find the energy of the collider. Wait, but what kind of energy? Oh, right, in particle physics, when we talk about the energy of a collider, we're usually referring to the kinetic energy of the particles, or sometimes the total energy. But I think in this context, it's the total energy because the question is about the speed being a certain fraction of the speed of light, which ties into relativistic energy.

So the formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m * c². And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me calculate gamma. So v = 0.96c, so v squared is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I do that accurately. Because 0.28 times 3.5714 would be roughly 1. 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, 0.28 * 3.57 is about 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, plus 0.28 * 0.07 is 0.0196, so total about 0.9996. Oh wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly because 0.0784 is 784/10000, which is (28/100)^2. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857... so about 3.5714. Let me note that down as gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy, but since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, I probably should use the exact rest mass, but for calculation purposes, I think we can approximate it as the sum of the individual nucleons' masses.

Wait, but Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², same as a neutron. So each is about 938.272 MeV/c². So for Li-6, the mass is (3 + 3) * 938.272 MeV/c². That's 6 * 938.272 MeV/c².

Calculating that: 6 * 938 = 5628. 6 * 0.272 is 1.632, so total is 5629.632 MeV. That's 5.629632 GeV/c².

Wait, but is that accurate enough? Alternatively, perhaps I should
