Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Alright, let me break this down.

First, let's read the question again. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed... Oh right, when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because of relativity. I remember that the formula for adding velocities in relativity is different. Oh right, the formula is something like (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). Let me make sure I get that right.

So the two velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. Wait, the problem says they're moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is the relative speed of B?

Wait, no, wait. The question says 'relative speed' but doesn't specify direction. Oh, wait, the problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. Hmm, so both are going the same way. So the relative speed of one with respect to the other would be the difference. But since it's relativistic, I can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c = 0.1c. I have to use that velocity addition formula.

So let me compute v_rel. Using the formula: (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c^2)), where u is the velocity of the first object (0.6c) and v is the velocity of the second object (0.5c), because we're finding u relative to v.

Wait, but does the order matter here? Because if I'm considering the relative speed of A as seen from B, then u would be 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c^2 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. That's one of the options. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, the energy of each astronaut includes their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Or wait, wait, the problem says "total energy of the system." So each astronaut has their own energy, which is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or is it just their total energy, which includes both?

Wait, in relativity, the total energy of an object is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So I need to compute the energy for each astronaut and add them together.

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Wait, that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So option C looks right.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations quickly. For the first astronaut: 0.6c. v²/c² = 0.36, 1 - 0.36=0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

Second astronaut: 0.5c. 0.25, 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. 1/0.8660≈1.1547. 3m * 1.1547 c² = 3.464 m c². So sum is 2.5 +3.464=5.964, which rounds to 5.96.

So the relative speed is ~0.14c, and the energy is ~5.96 mc². So option C is correct.

Wait, but what about the energy calculation? Oh, wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system"—so each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c². So 2m and 3m each contribute their own gamma factors. So yes, the approach is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \(v = 0.5c\) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), Velocity = \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), Velocity = \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
