Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A to D, each with different exponents, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (plx in arcseconds). So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, 0.5 would be 2 parsecs, etc.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So how many stars are there in a given range of parallax? I think this has to do with the volume of space, because more distant stars would be spread out over a larger volume. But wait, the stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed, so the number should depend on the volume.

Let me think about the volume. If we're considering stars at a certain distance, the volume they occupy is a sphere with radius equal to the distance. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So as the distance increases, the volume increases with the cube of the radius.

But wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So if d increases, plx decreases. So how does the volume depend on plx? Since volume is proportional to d³, and d is 1/plx, substituting that gives volume proportional to (1/plx)^3 = 1/plx^3.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if you have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness. Oh wait, I think for a thin shell, the volume is surface area times thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so the volume element would be 4πr² dr. And since r is in parsecs, dr would be the change in distance corresponding to the change in plx.

But wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So dr = (d/dplx)(1/plx) ) dplx. Wait, derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx is -1/(plx)^2. Hmm, but maybe an easier way is to express the volume in terms of plx.

So let's see. If I have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the corresponding distances are d = 1/plx and d + dd. The thickness in distance is dd = (d(d)/d(plx)) dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. The volume of the shell is 4πd² * dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but the negative sign indicates direction, but since we're dealing with absolute values (number of stars), we can ignore the sign. So volume is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) ) dplx = (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. The volume element is 4πd² dr. Since dr = (dd/dplx) dplx. And d = 1/plx, so dr = (d/dplx)(1/plx) ) = -1/(plx^2) dplx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. Oh wait, the dr is negative, but the volume is the absolute value. So volume element = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx? Wait, no, because dr is (1/plx^2) dplx in magnitude. Because the negative just means the distance is decreasing as plx increases, but volume is a positive quantity.

Wait,
