Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Okay, first, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Let me draw it mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering? In benzene, numbering starts such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3, tert-butyl at position 2. So the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions. Is that correct? Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, the compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering would be such that the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3, tert-butyl at position 2. So the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions around the ring.

Wait, that's a bit tricky because when you have multiple substituents on benzene, the numbering should be done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So let's see: the substituents are ethoxy (at position 1), tert-butyl (position 2), and nitro (position 3). So that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Alternatively, is there a lower numbering possible? No, because if you started at another position, the numbers would either not decrease or they'd be higher.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl groups. Now, the main problem is figuring out the order of reactions to introduce these groups.

I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order of introducing substituents matters because activating and deactivating groups can influence the reactivity. For example, nitro is a strong meta-directing group, while tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Ethoxy is also activating and ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but the substituents are in positions
