Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is all about the different planes and axes they possess. C3h symmetry... Wait, what's that exactly? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. Let me think. C3h has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a plane that's horizontal relative to the principal axis.

The question gives four options, all are organic compounds. I'll go through each option one by one.

First, let me list the options:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

Alright, so I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. That's a borate ester, right? Triisopropyl would mean three isopropyl groups attached to boron. I think the structure is B with three (CH(CH3)2) groups around it. Boron usually has a trigonal planar structure. Wait, but each isopropyl group is a substituent. So the molecule would have three identical groups around the central boron. So the symmetry here might be something like C3v or C3h.

Wait, if all three substituents are the same, then the molecule should have a C3 axis. But what about the mirror planes? Let's imagine the structure. Each isopropyl group is attached to B. The molecule is planar? Or is there a three-dimensional arrangement?

Wait, actually, triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. So the central boron is like a trigonal center. So the molecule should have a C3 axis. Now, for C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a horizontal mirror plane as well. But if the molecule is non-planar, then the mirror plane might not exist. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically on a trigonal planar structure, they might have a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, maybe. Or perhaps the molecule is in a tetrahedral-like arrangement? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Boron is in the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is -O-C(CH2CH3)2, wait no, triisopropyl borate is [B(O-i-C3H7)3]. The boron is in a trigonal planar arrangement. The molecule is symmetrical with three identical groups. So the symmetry should be D3h? Or maybe C3h? I remember that if there's a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then the point group is D3h, but wait, no, D3h has more elements. Wait, no, C3h is just the C3 axis plus a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me recall: C3h is a subgroup. The point group C3h consists of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Also, any combination of these operations. So in this case, if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h.

So triisopropyl borate, with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically, would have a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the substituents are all the same and arranged symmetrically around the C3 axis, then yes, there should be a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make the symmetry C3h. So option C could be correct.

But wait, let me check the other options too.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Its structure is like a cube with a nitrogen in the center. So it's a bridge structure. I think quinuclidine has a C3 symmetry. Because the molecule has three equivalent bridgeheads. So rotating it 120 degrees would bring it back to itself. But what about mirror planes? Quinuclidine has a center of inversion, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Or maybe a C2 axis?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane which is a cage compound. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Let me think, if you look down the C3 axis, which goes through the nitrogen and the opposite bridgehead, then a rotation of 120 degrees would cycle the three bridges. So it definitely has a C3 axis.

But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The molecule is symmetric, but perhaps the mirror plane is not horizontal. For instance, a horizontal plane might cut through the nitrogen. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, quinuclidine might have a C3v symmetry because it has a C3 axis and three mirror planes that are vertical. But C3v doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. So the point group for quinuclidine is Td, I think. Because it's a cube-like structure, so it's tetrahedral symmetry. Wait, no, the cube is Oh symmetry, but quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is more like a triangular prism arrangement. So perhaps its symmetry is D3h? Or C3h?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it. Alternatively, quinuclidine may not have a horizontal mirror plane. Because if you imagine a horizontal mirror plane, the top and bottom would need to be mirror images. But quinuclidine's structure is such that flipping it over a horizontal plane might not leave it looking the same. Because the bridges are in specific positions. I'm not so sure about this. Maybe quinuclidine has C3 symmetry but not a horizontal mirror, so it's point group is C3v or something else without the horizontal mirror.

So perhaps option D doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Now, moving on to option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the structure. It's a trifuran system, meaning three furan rings connected. The numbering might be a bit tricky, but the key is to look for symmetry.

The substituents are benzo groups attached at specific positions. Hmm, but without drawing it, I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric in a way that allows C3h. If the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion around a central point, then maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not certain. I think benzo-based molecules often have lower symmetry because the substituents are in specific positions.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, this also sounds complicated. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings. It's a structure where three benzene rings are connected in a sort of triangular arrangement. So if the trifuran is attached in a symmetric way to the triphenylene, then the whole molecule could have higher symmetry.

If the substituents (like the furan rings) are attached in a symmetrical fashion around the central triphenylene, then the molecule could have a C3 axis. Additionally, if there's a horizontal mirror plane, it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, looking up what triphenylene's structure is: triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings connected at adjacent positions. It has a center where three rings meet. If the substituents (like the furan parts) are attached symmetrically around this center, then the molecule would have a C3 axis and possibly a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think about the substituents. If the trifuran is attached at three positions that are symmetrically equivalent, then the molecule would have a C3 axis. And if the structure is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist. But if the substituents are in a non-planar arrangement, then perhaps not.

But considering that triphenylene itself is symmetric, perhaps the whole molecule including the trifuran substituents would inherit that symmetry.

So now, comparing options C and A.

Option C is triisopropyl borate, which I thought might have C3h symmetry. But wait, another thought: triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with three identical groups around the central boron. So the symmetry should be D3h. Because D3h includes a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and also vertical mirror planes.

Wait, wait, no. D3h is a point group with a principal axis of order 3 (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and three vertical mirror planes (each containing the C3 axis). So the point group is D3h, not C3h. Because C3h only includes the C3 and σh, without any other mirrors. So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it's more than C3h. But the question is, which has C3h symmetry.

Hmm, so perhaps triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which is more than C3h. So the molecule would have higher symmetry than what the question is asking for.

Wait, but if the molecule doesn't have any vertical mirror planes, then it might belong to C3h. So maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow vertical mirrors. Hmm, but in the case of triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is attached symmetrically. So whether it's D3h or C3h?

Alternatively, let me think about another molecule. For example, BF3 with three identical substituents. That would have D3h symmetry because it has a C3 axis, horizontal mirror plane, and vertical mirror planes. So triisopropyl borate, which is similar, would also have D3h.

So if that's the case, then triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h symmetry but D3h. So maybe none of the options have C3h? But that can't be because the question says one does.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Another approach: which of these structures is known to have C3h symmetry?

I recall that quinuclidine has a C3 axis but not a horizontal mirror plane. So its point group is C3v or maybe S6, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the triphenylene-based compound (option A) might have a C3h symmetry because the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the central point.

Wait, let's think about the structure of option B. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, the substituents are attached at positions 1,2-c; 3,4-c'; 5,6-c''. So it's a trifuran with three benzene rings attached in a symmetric way. If all three substituents are benzo groups attached at positions that are 120 degrees apart, then the molecule has a C3 axis. If it's also planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist, making the symmetry C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for a horizontal mirror. Maybe the oxygens are in positions that break the symmetry, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, without knowing the exact structures, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the options again.

The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry.

If C is triisopropyl borate, which I thought might have D3h but perhaps it's C3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borate structure: B is at the center with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is O-linked to B. The molecule is trigonal planar. So it's a flat molecule. So in this case, the molecule has a C3 axis, and because it's planar, a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis. So the point group would be D3h.

Wait, I'm getting confused between C3h and D3h.

Wait, C3h has a principal C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. The D3h group includes all the elements of C3h plus the three vertical mirror planes. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror, but no vertical mirrors, then it's C3h. But if it's planar and has vertical mirrors, then it's D3h.

So, triisopropyl borate is flat, so it's in a plane. Each isopropyl is in the same plane. So it's trigonal planar. So in this case, the molecule would have a C3 axis and three vertical mirror planes (each through a C-BO bond and the opposite substituent). So the point group would be D3h.

So option C's molecule has D3h symmetry, not C3h. So option C is not the correct answer.

Now, looking at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This is a trifuran derivative with three benzo substituents. Let's see if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the trifuran. If each benzo group is attached at positions that are 120 degrees apart, then the molecule would have a C3 axis.

Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically and the molecule is planar, then yes. So if the molecule is flat and has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then its point group is C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent positions make the molecule non-planar, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks the mirror plane. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Triphenylene is a symmetrical molecule, so if the trifuran substituents are attached in a symmetric way, the molecule might have C3h symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene is a tricyclic compound where three benzene rings are connected in a triangular arrangement. So the central part is symmetric. If the trifuran is attached at each of the three possible positions symmetrically, then the whole molecule would have a C3 axis. Also, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist, leading to C3h symmetry.

So perhaps option A is the correct answer.

Alternatively, let me think about another possibility. Which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry?

Wait, I remember that triphenylene-based compounds often have D3h symmetry because of the three substituents arranged symmetrically. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about what C3h symmetry entails. The molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same, and when you reflect it across a horizontal plane, it also looks the same.

So which of the given molecules fit this?

Option C: triisopropyl borate's point group is D3h.

Option A: if the molecule has C3h, then it's correct.

Option B: if it has substituents in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps it does.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: look for the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. For example, a plane that slices the molecule into top and bottom halves which are mirror images.

Triphenylene-based compounds (option A) might have a horizontal mirror plane if the substituents are arranged symmetrically above and below this plane. Wait, but triphenylene itself is a planar molecule, so maybe the substituents are also arranged in a way that allows for a horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran (option B) may have a C3 axis but not a horizontal mirror plane, so it might not be C3h.

Wait, another thought. If a molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it must have a point group of C3h. So which of the options has that.

Triisopropyl borate (C) has D3h, which includes C3h but more elements. So it's not C3h.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Because if the trifuran substituents are attached symmetrically to the triphenylene, the molecule would have a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe option B is the correct one. If each substituent (benzo groups) are attached in a way that's 120 degrees apart, then the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Hmm, without the actual structures, this is tough. Maybe I should look for which of these options is more likely to have C3h symmetry.

Another approach: which of these are known for their symmetry.

Triphenylene is known for being a highly symmetric molecule, so perhaps the compound in option A has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the compound in option B is a benzo-fused structure, which may not have the same symmetry as triphenylene.

Wait, another thought. Quinuclidine (option D) has a three-fold axis, but I don't think a horizontal mirror plane. So its point group is C3v, which doesn't fit C3h.

So, considering all this, the correct answer is option A.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). The molecule must look identical after a 120° rotation and remain unchanged when reflected across a horizontal plane.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is based on a triphenylene core, which is a highly symmetric structure with three benzene rings arranged in a triangular fashion. The trifuran substituents are attached symmetrically to the triphenylene core. This arrangement introduces a **C₃ axis** due to the 120° rotational symmetry. Additionally, if the molecule is planar and the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it would also possess a **horizontal mirror plane (σₕ)**. Thus, this molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a trifuran core with three benzo substituents attached at specific positions. While the benzo groups may introduce some symmetry, the substituents are not arranged in a way that guarantees a **C₃ axis** or a **horizontal mirror plane**. The asymmetry in the substituent positions likely prevents the molecule from having **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups, forming a trigonal planar structure. This molecule has a **C₃ axis** due to the symmetry of the three identical substituents. However, it also has **vertical mirror planes**, which elevates its symmetry to **D₃h** rather than **C₃h**. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, it lacks a **horizontal mirror plane**, as the molecule is not symmetric across such a plane. Its symmetry group is **C₃v**, not **C₃h**, so it does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **Option A** (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) is the only molecule that possesses both a **C₃ axis** and a **horizontal mirror plane**, making it the correct choice for **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: A**
