Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit at light speed. And energy is a bit more complicated too because of gamma factors. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, the relative speed part. I remember that when you're trying to find the speed of one object from another's frame, you can't just subtract the velocities normally because that would sometimes give you speeds faster than light, which isn't possible. So there's this formula for relativistic velocity addition.

The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I should make sure which one is v1 and which is v2. The problem says astronaut 1 has mass 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. So from astronaut 2's frame, astronaut 1 is moving at v_rel. So v1 would be 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c.

Plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Hmm, so approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that part is either C or D.

Now for the total energy. The total energy of a system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 1: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². Hmm, so about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and a relative speed of 0.14c. Option D's energy is 5 mc², which is lower than what I calculated. So the correct option seems to be C.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I account for the rest mass correctly? The rest energy is mc², but their masses are 2m and 3m, so yes, the calculations should be correct.

Another check: For astronaut 1, E1 is (gamma) * (2m) c². Gamma for 0.6c is indeed 5/4. So 5/4 * 2m c² = (5/2) mc² = 2.5 mc². Correct.

For astronaut 2, gamma is 1/sqrt(3/4) which is 2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547. 3m * 2/sqrt(3) * c² = (6/sqrt(3)) mc² = 2 sqrt(3) mc². Because 6/sqrt(3) is 2*3/sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3) since sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)=3. 2 sqrt(3) is approximately 3.464. So 5.964 total.

So the correct answer is option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches the relative speed in options C and D.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

This matches the energy value in option C. Option D has an incorrect energy value of \(5mc^2\), which is lower than the calculated total energy. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
