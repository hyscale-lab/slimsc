Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. I remember that you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Let me write that down. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging in: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. That's the relative speed. So which options have that? Options C and D have 0.14c. So I'll have to figure out the energies to decide between them.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by mc squared. But wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m. So each's energy would be gamma * (their mass) * c².

So first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma for him is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E =5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. Option D has E=5, which is close but not exactly what I got.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in gamma.

First astronaut: 0.6c. 0.6 squared is 0.36. 1-0.36=0.
