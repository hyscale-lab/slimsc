Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given information includes the pH being ideal and the temperature at 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A through D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the stability constant tells us how strong this complex is. A high K value like 5e10 suggests it's a very stable complex.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration is [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+]. 

I think the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (or some form, depending on the pH). The reaction is probably something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The stability constant K is given as K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal. I think that means the pH is such that EDTA is in its most common form, probably Y^4-, the deprotonated form which is the one that complexes metal ions effectively.

So, considering that, the complex formation is Ca²+ + Y^4- → CaY²-.

The stability constant K is 5e10, which is a huge number, meaning the complex is very stable. So, in solution, most of the EDTA and Ca would be tied up in the complex. But wait, the problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the complex. So initially, all the Ca is in the complex.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. Since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Let me think about the expression again. K = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+
