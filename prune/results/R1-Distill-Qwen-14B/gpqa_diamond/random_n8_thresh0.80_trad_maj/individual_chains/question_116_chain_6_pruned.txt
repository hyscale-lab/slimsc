Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration numbers tell us about the number of equivalent protons. So 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet.

Let me think about common structures. A triplet at 0.9 ppm usually suggests methyl groups next to a CH2. Like in an ethyl group maybe. Wait, for an ethyl group, the CH2 would split into a quartet, and the adjacent CH3 would be a triplet. So ethyl groups. But the integration is 6H for the triplet and 4H for the quartet. Oh wait, maybe there are two ethyl groups. Because each ethyl has a CH2 (2H) and a CH3 (3H). So two ethyl groups would give 6H for the triplet (two CH3) and 4H for the quartet (two CH2). So the structure must be something with two ethyl groups attached.

So Compound A is maybe diethyl something. Like diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. Let me think about the NMR of diethyl ether. The CH3 groups in diethyl ether are split into a quartet because each is adjacent to a CH2. The CH2 would be a triplet. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, in diethyl ether, each CH3 is next to a CH2-O. The CH2 would split into a quartet because the two OCH2 groups have neighboring CH3. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl ester or something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is 2,2-dimethylbutane or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Or perhaps a diethyl ether, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this part. Let me think again.

If the triplet is 6H, that's two sets of 3H each. And the quartet is 4H, which is two sets of 2H each. So maybe it's a structure where two ethyl groups are attached to the same carbon? Like diethyl something attached to a central carbon. For example, maybe (CH2CH3)2CH2? Wait, but that would be 2-ethyl groups attached to a CH2. Let me think about the NMR. The central CH2 would be next to two CH2CH3 groups. So the central CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups, leading to splitting. But in this problem, the CH2 is a quartet, so perhaps each of the central CH2's protons are next to two CH3 groups?

Wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, that's just neopentane, which has a single peak. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to an oxygen, like diethyl ether. Let me consider diethyl ether's NMR. The CH3 groups in diethyl ether would each be a quartet because each is attached to a CH2 which is adjacent to an oxygen. So each CH3 is split by the two neighboring CH2 protons, leading to a quartet. The CH2 groups would be split by the adjacent CH3 and the oxygen. Wait, no, the CH2 in diethyl ether would be next to an oxygen, so they are like CH2-O. The protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3 groups. So each OCH2 would have two neighboring CH3 groups, each with three protons. That might lead to a triplet or a quartet?

Wait, let me think. For an OCH2CH3 group: the CH2 is connected to O and CH3. The CH3's are attached to CH2, so the CH2's protons (each H) would see the two Hs on the same CH2 and the three Hs on the adjacent CH3. Wait, no. Each H on the CH2 is next to two Hs on the same CH2 (so that's a triplet) and the three Hs on the adjacent CH3. So the splitting would be a quartet for each CH2. Because each H is split by the adjacent CH3's three Hs. So each CH2 would be a quartet, and the integral would be 4H (two CH2, each 2H). The CH3 groups would each be a triplet because each is adjacent to a CH2 with two Hs. So the CH3's would be triplet, with integral 6H (two CH3, each 3H). That matches the NMR data given: triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH3) and quartet at 1.3 ppm (OCH2). So Compound A is diethyl ether, (CH2CH3)2O.

Wait, no, wait. Diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O, right. So its structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So each CH2CH3 group is attached to O. So yeah, that structure would give the NMR as described: triplet for CH3, quartet for CH2.

So Compound A is diethyl ether. Then, it undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. Monobromination of diethyl etherâ€”probably via a substitution reaction. But wait, diethyl ether is an ether, and bromination usually occurs at the less substituted position? Or via some mechanism. Wait, diethyl ether in presence of a brominating agent, perhaps via a radical mechanism or via substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's an SN2 substitution at the less hindered site, but ethers are generally not very reactive towards SN2 because the leaving group (like if it's O-) is not a good leaving group. Oh wait, maybe monobromination refers to adding a bromine atom somewhere else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: diethyl ether can be brominated under certain conditions. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Diethyl ether has an oxygen, and maybe the bromination occurs at the methyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely that the bromine substitutes one of the ethyl groups, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. Monobromination would add a bromine atom. But where? Alternatively, perhaps the diethyl ether undergoes an elimination reaction, but the question says it undergoes monobromination, which is substitution.

Wait, another approach:
