Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they provided the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. My task is to identify compound X from the given options.

Hmm, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? I think it's often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, but the reaction conditions might determine whether it's an acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed opening. Since the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is high, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed process, but wait, no, 1,4-diazabicyclo is a base. So perhaps it's a base-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide?

Wait, but epoxide ring openings can happen under various conditions. Oh, but in this case, the starting material is compound X, and the product's NMR is given. So maybe I should figure out what the product is, and then work backward to find X.

So, the product has a certain structure that shows specific NMR signals. Let me think about what those signals mean.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet for 3H. Could be a methyl group attached to something electronegative, maybe a carbonyl? Or perhaps a methylene adjacent to an oxygen? Or maybe a CH3 in an aromatic environment? Wait, in aromatic compounds, methyl groups can be attached to benzene rings, like toluene. Their protons typically show up around δ 2.3-2.5 as a singlet if they're attached to a benzene ring.

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet for 3H. Could be another methyl group. Maybe adjacent to another oxygen or part of a different structure.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, we have two singlets for 3H each. So maybe two methyl groups in the molecule.

Then, looking at the aromatic region:

- 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet. This suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.
- 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Could be part of a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe a styrene structure?
- 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet.
- 7.71 (2H, d): Another doublet.

Hmm, the aromatic signals are a bit tricky. Let me see. If the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, maybe it's a trans coupling, like in a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Or perhaps it's a substituent with adjacent protons.

Wait, the 13C NMR data: 

- 21.3 (1C, s): Probably a methyl carbon, maybe attached to an oxygen or another group.
- 28.4 (1C, s): Another methyl, perhaps a CH2 group or another type of carbon.
- 126.9 (2C, s): Two carbons, same shift. Maybe aromatic carbons attached to substituents.
- 127.1 (1C, s): One carbon, perhaps a central aromatic carbon in a benzene ring.
- 129.1 (2C, s): Two more aromatic carbons.
- 130.3 (1C, s): Another aromatic carbon.
- 141.5 and 144.1 (1C each, s): These look like carbons attached to electronegative groups, maybe carbons attached to an oxygen or part of a double bond. For example, carbons in an epoxide ring or carbonyl groups.
- 197.7 (1C, s): A very
