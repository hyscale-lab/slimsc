Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that the mass dimension is important for renormalizability, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I think each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, so each term in the integral over d^4x must be dimension 4.

Wait, the Lagrangian has the form of an interaction term. So L_int should have mass dimension 4, right? Because each term in the Lagrangian density has to have dimension 4, since when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c =1, but I guess mass dimension is the same in any units).

So the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have dimension 4. Now I need to find the dimensions of each part.

I know that the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, so each ψ has dimension 3/2. ψ̄ is the same as ψ because it's just ψ† γ^0, so same dimension.

What about σ_{μν}? σ is constructed from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. The commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is dimensionless because gammas are matrices, not operators with dimensions. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is 0.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. F is the derivative of the gauge field A, so F has two derivatives. Each derivative has dimension 1. So F^{μν} must have dimension 2, since each derivative adds 1. Wait, F is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each term in F has two derivatives? Wait no, each F has two indices, but each component is a derivative. So F is [∂][A]. A is a gauge field, which in 4D has dimension 1, because it's a field in the vector potential, which is like a dimension 1 field (since Maxwell action has ∫ F², which is (∂A)^2, so each A is dimension 1).

Wait, wait. Field strength F_{μ
