Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again. It says racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, wait. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis involves breaking and reforming of double bonds by the redistribution of alkylidene groups. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis, ring-opening metathesis, and cross metathesis. But in this case, our starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me think about its structure.

So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right. Let me draw it:

Carbon 1: CH2=CH-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH3?

Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the middle of the chain. Let me number again.

1   2   3   4   5
CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So adding a methyl to carbon 3 would make it CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene.

But wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me make sure. The correct structure is CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)-
