Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit shaky on it, but let's try to think through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. So the problem gives me a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. I also see that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Wait, so the formula for the formation constant is something like K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]), right? Because EDTA typically has a charge of 4- when it's deprotonated enough to form the complex. So in this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA, and K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, indicating a stable complex.

But the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt, I suppose. Let's think—when you have a 1:1 complex like this, the concentration of the complex would be equal to the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- in the dissociation. Wait, no. Because the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So when that dissolves, it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- in a 1:1 ratio. So if we assume that the complex is fully dissociated, the concentration of each would be 0.02 M. But wait, that's not right because the K is given, and K is a large number, which suggests that the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the dissociation is minimal, meaning that the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and EDTA are much lower.

Oh wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The K is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is 5e10, which is a very large number. So that means the complex is highly
