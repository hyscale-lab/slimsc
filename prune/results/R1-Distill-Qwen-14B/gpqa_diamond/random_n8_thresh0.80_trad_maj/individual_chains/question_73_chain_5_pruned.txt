Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

So, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are given for both the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the speeds. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula I recall is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the second from the first's perspective would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that narrows it down to B, C, or D? Wait, option B says 0.1c, which is the numerator, but not the relativistic addition result.

Wait, the question is about the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other. So, which one is whose perspective? Let's see. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of B in the original frame, and v is the
