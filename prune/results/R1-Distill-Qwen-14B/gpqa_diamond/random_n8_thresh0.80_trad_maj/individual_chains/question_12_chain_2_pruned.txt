Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and nu (a neutrino, I assume). The pion is initially at rest, so that's an important point. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, the muon is 105.7 MeV.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products, the muon and the neutrino, must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That probably means their magnitudes of momentum are the same.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think the muon neutrino is considered massless for these kinds of problems, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the other particles here, so we can approximate it as zero. That would make things simpler.

So, the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c². Since it's at rest, its kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is 139.6 MeV.

After the decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy would be just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

Wait, but in reality, the neutrino has some mass, but in this problem, we're probably treating it as massless. So, E_nu = p_nu c, since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, and m=0.

Now, for momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. Hence, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p_mu = -p_nu, but their magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So, the total momentum is zero as required.

Now, considering energy. The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c². Because the pion's energy is all converted into the energies of the decay products.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c². And E_nu is the total energy of the neutrino, which is p c since m_nu is zero.

So, the equation becomes:

gamma * m_mu c² + p c = m_pi c²

But gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2). Also, gamma can be expressed in terms of momentum and mass: gamma = (p c²) / (m_mu c) ) = (p c) / (m_mu).

Wait
