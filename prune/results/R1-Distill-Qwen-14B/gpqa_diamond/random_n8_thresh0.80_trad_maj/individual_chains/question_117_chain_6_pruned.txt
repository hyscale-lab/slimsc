Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? Specifically, it's about whether a compound can have enantiomers, which are mirror images that are not superimposable. So, for a compound to show optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other form of stereogenic element, like a plane of symmetry or a center that makes it asymmetrical.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can sometimes have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to be chiral. The structure here is a biphenyl with two dimethyl ester groups and two nitro groups. If the substituents are on opposite sides of the biphenyl rings, maybe they can form enantiomers. Wait, but biphenyls can have a possibility of being meso or having axial chirality. Oh, right! Axial chirality occurs when there's a twist in the biphenyl ring, like in binaphthyl compounds. If the substituents on each phenyl ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can be chiral. So this compound probably has axial chirality. So, it should exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH3)C(OH)COO-. Wait no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. Structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO- methyl ester. So the structure is: the ester is OMe attached to the COO. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOCH2-COOCH3? Or wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, wait, the propanoate ion is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but methyl ester is CH3O-CO-O- attached. So the structure is:
