Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's eight carbons, nine hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Hmm, that's interesting. So, what kind of compounds fit that? Maybe something with an aromatic ring, like a benzene ring, since the formula includes N and O.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). A triplet at around 9.7 ppm. That's a strong downfield shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group here.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's a doublet, likely from aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring because the coupling is with one proton, giving a doublet.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Another doublet, also aromatic. Wait, if the first is 6.98 and this is 6.51, perhaps they're para to each other. Like two sets of doublets. Maybe two para-substituted benzene rings? Or maybe one is attached to an electron-withdrawing group, making the protons downfield more.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, two protons. Could be something like a conjugated double bond or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents that cause broadening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted alkene, but I'm not sure.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet around 3.66. That's probably a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or an ester, or perhaps a ketone. But considering the coupling, maybe adjacent to something else.

Putting this together, the molecule might have an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm), two benzene rings perhaps (from the aromatic signals), a conjugated double bond, and a CH2 group attached to something.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons. Let's think: for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically two doublets each. So maybe two benzene rings attached, each with substituents.

Wait, but the aldehyde is at 9.72, which is quite high. If it's an aldehyde, then maybe the compound is something like cinnamaldehyde derivative, but with more substituents?

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, in this case, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2= (10)/2=5 degrees. That's five degrees: could be a benzene ring (3) plus a double bond (1) and a ring or another double bond. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and a ketone and a double bond, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring (like a cyclopropane? No, probably not. Or maybe another double bond, but that would be two. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 9.72, which is a coupling with two protons. Wait, no, a triplet implies coupling with two different protons? Or maybe two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually not split because they're usually at the end, but maybe in this case it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but waitâ€”if the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Like RCH2CHO. Or perhaps the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group which is adjacent to another group.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm signal: a doublet for 2H. So that's a CH2 group attached to something. Maybe it's part of an enol or something like that. Alternatively, maybe a OCH2CH2O structure, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule has two benzene rings connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde and a double bond. Let me think about the structure.

Looking at the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): could that be a conjugated diene or an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded? Or perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, another approach: the reaction steps. The compound is first treated with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aq. KOH and heat.

NaNO2 and HCl usually are used in nitrous acid reactions. In aromatic chemistry, that might be for diazotization. Diazonium salts are formed from aromatic amines, right? So perhaps the starting material has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So if there's an aromatic amine (like aniline), the formula would have a NH2 group. But since the formula has one N and one O, maybe it's a nitro group? Wait, but that's more O.

Wait, maybe the starting material has an -OCH3 group? Or an -OH group?

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps again.

1. NaNO2 and HCl: likely forming a diazonium salt. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine group. Wait, but in the NMR, I don't see any signals indicative of NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is an aniline derivative. So when treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it would form a diazonium chloride. Then, upon treatment with H2O (maybe a hydrolysis step?), and then with KOH and heat, perhaps a substitution reaction occurs.

Wait, after diazotization, maybe the diazonium salt undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol group. So if the starting material has a -NH2 group, after this process, it would become -OH.

But wait, let me think about the NMR. The 6.27 ppm (bs,
