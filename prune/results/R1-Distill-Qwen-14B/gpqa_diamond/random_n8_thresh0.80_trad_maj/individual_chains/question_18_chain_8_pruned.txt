Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, compared to each other. Hmm.

The given data includes masses of the stars, their abundances as [X/Y] values, and the solar photosphere composition. Oh wait, but wait, the masses might not matter here because the question is about elemental ratios, which are abundance ratios, so maybe the mass isn't directly needed. I'll keep that in mind.

So, the given elements are silicon (Si), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), and hydrogen (H). The problem gives the following values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the ratio of Si to Fe is higher by 0.3 dex compared to the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So the ratio of Fe to H is the same as in the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg is more abundant relative to Si by 0.3 dex than the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So Mg to H is same as the Sun.

The solar compositions are:
- 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. So 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but I think I need to get the ratios of the elements in each star relative to the Sun.

The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star_2]/[Si/Star_1]?

Wait, no, the ratio is (n_Si,Star1)/(n_Si,Star2). Or is it [Si/Star2] relative to [Si/
