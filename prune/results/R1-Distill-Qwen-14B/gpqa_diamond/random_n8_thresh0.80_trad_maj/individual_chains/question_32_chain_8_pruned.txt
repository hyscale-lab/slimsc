Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use relativistic equations. Right, so I should probably use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium. The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. So, if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So X is Li-6. Got it. So the mass of the nucleus is the mass of a Li-6 atom.

But wait, when calculating relativistic energies, do we use the rest mass energy or the rest mass in kilograms? I think the rest mass energy is mc², so that would be useful here.

So, the rest mass energy (mc²) for a Li-6 nucleus. Let me think about how to find that. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the atomic mass. Each atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.660539e-27 kg. So, the mass of a Li-6 atom is approximately 6 u. Wait, but wait—wait, in reality, the actual mass of the nucleus is a bit less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy (mass defect), but for heavy ions like Li-6, maybe I can approximate it as 6 u. Hmm, but maybe I should look for the exact mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the molar mass and Avogadro's number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass energy of a proton multiplied by the number of nucleons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the rest mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So, for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV, which is 5628 MeV, or 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's an approximation because in reality, the binding energy makes the nucleus's mass slightly less. But perhaps for this problem, we can proceed with this approximation since the exact mass might be given or perhaps we're expected to model it this way.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact rest mass using the atomic mass. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Each u is 1.660539e-27 kg. So, the mass m is 6.013 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait. The actual atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. But the atomic mass includes the electrons. So, for a nucleus, we should subtract the mass of the electrons. A Li atom has 3 electrons. Each electron has a rest mass of about 0.00054858 u. So, three electrons would be about 0.0016457 u. So the nuclear mass would be 6.013 u minus 0.0016457 u, which is approximately 6.0113543 u.

So, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.01135 u. Then, we can compute the rest mass energy as m c².

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

First, find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Then, calculate its rest energy. Then, compute the total energy when it's moving at 0.96c.

The formula for the total relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v=0.96c, let's compute gamma.

v = 0.96c
v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 = 0.0784.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is indeed 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely:

v = 0.96c
v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c²
1 - (v²/c²) = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28
gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy for the Li-6 nucleus is m c². So I need to find m.

As earlier, Li-6 nucleus has a mass of about 6.01135 u.

Each u is 1.660539e-27 kg.

So m = 6.01135 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Let me compute that:

6.01135 * 1.660539e-27 = let's compute 6 * 1.660539e-27 is approx 9.963234e-27 kg.

But wait, 6.01135 is 6 + 0.01135. So 0.01135 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ 1.877e-28 kg.

So total m ≈ 9.963234e-27 + 1.877e-28 = approx 1.0050934e-26 kg.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure: 6 * 1.660539e-27 = 6 * 1.660539 is 9.963234e-27. Then 0.01135 * 1.660539e-27 is approx 0.01135 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.01877e-27=1.877e-29 kg. Wait, no, 0.01135 * 1.6605e-27 = (0.01135)(1.6605e-27) = 0.01877e-27 = 1.877e-29.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, 6.01135 u = 6.01135 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Let me compute 6 * 1.660539e-27 = 9.963234e-27 kg.

0.01135 * 1.660539e-27 = (0.01 * 1.660539e-27) = 1.660539e-29, plus (0.00135 * 1.660539e-27) = 2.24245e-30.

So 0.01135 * 1.660539e-27 = (1.660539e-29) + (2.24245e-30) = 1.884784e-29 kg.

So total m = 9.963234e-27 + 1.884784e-29 = 9.963234e-27 + 0.01884784e-27 = approximately 9.9820818e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately
