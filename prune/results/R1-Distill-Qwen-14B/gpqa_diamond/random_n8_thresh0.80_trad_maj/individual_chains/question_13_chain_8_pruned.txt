Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, a bicyclic monoterpene actually, something like menthol but different structure. Wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Let me think. Oh right, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, but wait, no, I think it's a cyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. Maybe it's a bicyclo structure? Or is it a six-membered ring with a methyl group? Hmm. Oh wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, a cyclic ether? No, I think it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. But perhaps it's more like a substituted cyclohexene or something similar.

Wait, limonene structure. Let me visualize. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific stereochemistry. Oh wait, no, limonene is actually a monocyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a cyclohexene ring with a specific substituent. Right, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene? No, actually, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but not a bicyclic. It's a cyclic monoterpene with a specific arrangement. Oh! Limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene called
