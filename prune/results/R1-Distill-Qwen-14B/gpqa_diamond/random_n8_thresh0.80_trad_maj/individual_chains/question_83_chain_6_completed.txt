Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we're titrating this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The given Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, it dissociates more because of the lower concentration. So first, I probably need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution is calculated using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2.

So C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 * 0.05? Wait, wait, let me do the math. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in the diluted solution would be Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) equals 0.001 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the diluted solution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001 moles as well. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required for equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Now, the problem is about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

So for the 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³.

At 25% titration, it's the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of CH3COOH were 0.001, the moles remaining after reaction would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at this point is initial volume of diluted acetic acid (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ NaOH. So 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, this is a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.736 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, maybe I'll just use 4.73 for approximation).

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Looking at the options, the first part is 4.26 in option A, 4.57 in D, etc. So that's around 4.25, so option A has 4.26, D has 4.57. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, let me re-calculate the ratio.

Moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. So about 4.25. The option A says 4.26, so that's close.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

The moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol, as previously calculated. The total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

At initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02) = 5.405e-10

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484.

So pH = 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516.

Wait, that's about 8.52. Looking at the options, option A has pH 8.52 at equivalence. So the equivalence point pH would be around 8.52.

Wait, but wait, I thought that for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point is basic, and the pH would be around 8.5, which matches option A's second value.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26, and equivalence point pH is 8.52. That's option A.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option D) 4.57; 6.92

Wait, I'm confident in my calculations. The 25% gives pH around 4.25, and equivalence is ~8.52. So the first part is 4.26, second is 8.52. So option A is correct.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again about the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Wait, the ratio I had was [A-]/[HA] = 0.3333. So log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH is pKa (4.73) minus 0.477, which is 4.253. So 4.25, which rounds to 4.26. So yes, option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Wait, let's recheck the first step.

Initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1 mmol) / 40 mL = 0.025 M. That's correct.

So the initial concentration is 0.025 M.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 25% of the equivalence moles. Equivalence moles are 0.001, so 25% is 0.00025 mol. Correct.

So the calculation for the buffer seems correct.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate the log(1/3) more accurately. Log(3) is about 0.4771, so log(1/3) is -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, which is approximately 4.25. So 4.26 is reasonable.

So the first pH is 4.26, and the equivalence point is 8.52. So option A.

But wait, why is option D's second value 6.92? That seems lower than expected.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me recheck that.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the concentration is 0.001 mol in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Kb = Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Setting up Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. Wait, wait, no. Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is sqrt(1.081)*1e-5.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. But 1.081 is about 1.04², so sqrt(1.081)= approx 1.04. So 1.04 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let's calculate that more accurately.

3.288e-6 → log(3.288) is approx 0.5169, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5169 -6 = -5.4831. So pOH is 5.4831. So pH is 14 -5.4831 = 8.5169, which is approximately 8.52. So yes, the equivalence point is around 8.52, so option A's second value.

So the correct answer seems to be option A, which has 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is first choice. So the answer should be A.


To solve the problem, we start by determining the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the diluted concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20 \, \text{cm}^3}{40 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = C_2 \times V_2 = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

For the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH required to neutralize all the acetic acid are equal to the moles of acetic acid. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{moles of NaOH}}{C_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻), forming a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the ICE table and assuming \( x \) is small, the hydroxide ion concentration is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x^2 = 0.02 \times 5.405 \times 10^{-10} = 1.081 \times 10^{-11} \implies x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (2.5 cm³ of NaOH) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and the moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
