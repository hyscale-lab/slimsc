Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, right, in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are because thermal energy provides the energy to reach higher energy levels.

I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor is e^(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. So the probability of an atom being in a higher energy state is lower if the temperature is lower, but wait, in this case, the excitation is higher in star_1.

Wait, no—wait, the question says the iron atoms are "twice as excited" in star_1. I think that refers to the number of atoms in that specific energy level being higher. So the population in that level is higher for star_1 than star_2. So for star_1, the fraction (or number) of atoms in the excited state is higher.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. If the energy difference between the levels is ΔE, then the ratio N_upper/N_lower is proportional to e^(-ΔE/(k T)). So if star_1 has twice as many excited (upper) atoms as star_2, wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_
