Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

The question says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. We need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I should probably keep track of the units.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but here, since we have different concentrations and volumes, it's not the standard case. So I need to calculate the actual amount of acid and base to see how much reaction occurs.

First, I think I need to find the moles of each acid and base. Let's break it down.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+ ion. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So the first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ per molecule. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each mole gives two OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2OH^-.

So, the reaction will be between H+ (from acids) and OH- (from base) to form water. The enthalpy change depends on the moles of H+ and OH- available. But wait, which one is the limiting reagent here? Because the one in lesser amount will determine how much reaction happens.

Let me calculate moles for each.

For HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.
Each HCl gives 1 H+, so H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

For H2SO4:
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.
Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now for Ba(OH)2:
Molarity 0.5 M, volume 200 mL = 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.
Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So how much can react?

We have 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 <
