Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. 

First, I need to figure out the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw it out. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would add a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, let me count again. The main chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at 1. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the main chain is five carbons, double bond starts at 1. So positions 1 (double bond), 2, 3, 4, 5. At position 3, there's a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Wait, no. Let me count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is connected to another CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Pentane is five carbons. 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try drawing it.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So
