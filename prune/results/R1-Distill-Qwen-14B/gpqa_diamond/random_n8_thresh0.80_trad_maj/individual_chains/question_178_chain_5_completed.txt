Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which are the gamma matrices. So this term involves the field strength tensor F, which comes from electromagnetism-type theories, I think. But wait, this might be a non-Abelian theory because F is usually for gauge fields, but here it's just F^{μν}, which I think is the field tensor for something like electromagnetism. Or wait, maybe it's for a different gauge group, but the specifics might not matter here.

But the main point is to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important for renormalizability. Terms with operators of certain dimensions are allowed if the theory is renormalizable. The dimension tells us the scaling behavior under a change of energy scale.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I'll need to figure out the dimensions of all the other terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has the structure κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

First, I should recall the mass dimensions of the fields and other components. Let's see:

- For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is [ψ] = 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so the Lagrangian density has dimension 4. The kinetic term is like ∂μ ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂^μ ψ, which has each derivative ∂ having dimension 1. So each ∂μ acting on ψ contributes 1, and since ψ has dimension 3/2, each derivative brings a 1, so the term has dimension 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 + 1 = 4, which makes sense for a Lagrangian. So yeah, [ψ] = 3/2.

- The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from gauge fields. For electromagnetism, the gauge field A_mu has dimension 1. Then F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative adds 1, and A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

Wait, because F is made from two derivatives on A? Wait, no. A_mu is dimension 1. The derivative ∂_mu has dimension 1. So F^{mu nu} is ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu. Each term is ∂ A, so each has dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they don't carry mass dimension; they're just matrices. So [γ_mu][gamma_nu] is also dimensionless. Thus, [σ_{mu nu}] = 0.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, F.

Let's compute the dimension of each part:

ψ̄ has dimension [ψ]^* = [ψ] = 3/2.

σ is dimensionless, so that's 0.

ψ is 3/2.

F is 2.

So the product is [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2. Wait, but wait, the sigma term is a tensor with two indices, but I think in terms of dimensions, it's just a number. So each σ_mu nu is dimensionless, so the product of ψ̄, σ, ψ, F would be:

(3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (3/2 * 3/2) is 9/4, times 2 is 9/4 * 2 = 9/2.

But wait, wait. Wait, let's think again. The term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

So the tensor indices are contracted, but in terms of mass dimension, each term is just a product. So yes, the dimension is [ψ̄] [ψ] [F].

Wait, but the sigma is a Lorentz tensor, so it doesn't affect the mass dimension because it's just a coefficient. So the mass dimension of the term is:

[ψ̄] * [ψ] * [F] = (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, 3/2 times 3/2 is 9/4, times 2 gives 9/2.

So the entire term's mass dimension is (3/2)+(3/2)+(2) = (3/2*2) is 3, plus 2 is 5? Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of each factor. Each ψ̄ and ψ are each (3/2), and F is 2. So the product is 3/2 * 3/2 * 2.

Wait, 3/2 multiplied by 3/2 is 9/4, multiplied by 2 is 18/4 = 9/2 = 4.5.

So the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension [κ] + 4.5.

Wait, because in the Lagrangian, each term must have mass dimension 4, because the Lagrangian is a density, and the action is dimensionless (in units where ħ=c=1), so ∫ L d^4x has to be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So the dimension of the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F is [κ] + [ψ̄][ψ][F] = [κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 2.

Wait, wait, no. Because the product ψ̄ σ ψ F would be (3/2) (from ψ̄) + (3/2) (from ψ) + 2 (from F). Because sigma is dimensionless. So 3/2 + 3/2 = 3, plus 2 is 5.

So the term κ multiplied by that would be [κ] +5. And since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ] = 4-5= -1.

Wait, so [κ] is -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizable theories are those where all the interaction terms have coupling constants with positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the condition for a theory to be renormalizable is that the mass dimension of the coupling constant is greater than or equal to zero. Because in perturbation theory, each loop brings in a factor of the coupling, and for the theory to be predictive (i.e., not requiring an infinite number of counterterms), the couplings should have positive mass dimension so that higher-order terms are suppressed.

Wait, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. The general rule is that for a term in the Lagrangian of the form g O, where O is an operator of mass dimension d, the coupling g must have mass dimension d -4, because the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So [g] = (4 - d).

Wait, no, because the term in the Lagrangian is g O, and the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So [g O] =4. If O has dimension d, then [g] =4 -d.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of scaling. The Lagrangian must have dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for each term g O, [g] + [O] =4.

So, for the term in question, which is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ, the operator part has dimension 5. So [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1.

But wait, for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling constant must have a mass dimension ≥0. Because if [κ] is negative, then the term is of higher order, and the theory is not renormalizable. Because higher mass dimension operators are of higher order in the expansion.

Wait, no. Let's think about renormalizability in terms of superficial degree of divergence. A theory is renormalizable if all the interaction vertices have a superficial degree of divergence ≤0. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (sum of the mass dimensions of the fields in the vertex).

In this case, the vertex is the interaction term κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The fields involved are ψ, ψ̄, and F. Each ψ is 3/2, so two ψ's give 3. F is 2. So the sum is 3 + 2 =5. The coupling κ has dimension -1. So the superficial degree of divergence is D =4 - (5) ) = -1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a vertex, the superficial degree of divergence is D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the vertex). But wait, each ψ contributes 3/2, so two of them are 3. F contributes 2. So sum is 5. So D =4 -5 = -1. So D is negative, which means the graph is convergent. But wait, I thought that for renormalizability, all superficial degrees of divergence should be ≤0. So if D ≤0, then the graph is either logarithmically divergent (D=0) or convergent (D<0). So this would imply the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. No, I think I'm mixing up concepts here. Because the dimension of the coupling also affects whether the term is renormalizable. Wait, let me think differently. The term in the Lagrangian is an interaction term. The general rule is: The interaction term is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling constant is positive or zero. Because if the coupling is dimensionless (like in phi^4 theory), then the theory is renormalizable. If the coupling has positive dimension, that might also be okay, but wait, no, because the dimension of the coupling is [g] = 4 - [operator]. So for example, in a φ^3 theory, the operator is φ^3, which has dimension 3*(3/2) =9/2. So [g] =4 -9/2= -1/2. So that term would have a negative dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, so in our case, [κ] is -1, which is negative. That suggests that the theory is not renormalizable. Because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. So the term is of higher dimension, and thus the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: The mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and it's renormalizable, which can't be right. So the correct answer is C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The mass dimensions of the fields and operators are as follows:

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The operator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have a total mass dimension of 4, as the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. The mass dimension of the term is given by:

\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
[\kappa] + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 0.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

Next, to determine whether the theory is renormalizable, we consider the superficial degree of divergence $D$ of the interaction term. For a term involving fields with mass dimensions $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, and coupling $[\kappa] = -1$, the superficial degree of divergence is given by:

\[
D = 4 - \text{(sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term)}.
\]

The sum of the dimensions of the fields is:

\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

Thus:

\[
D = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

Since $D < 0$, the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a negative mass dimension, indicating that the interaction term is of higher order and the theory requires an infinite number of counterterms to define it.

From the given options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it claims the theory is renormalizable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it claims the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $1$.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it states the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$ and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it claims the theory is not renormalizable but gives the wrong mass dimension for $\kappa$.

**Answer: C**
