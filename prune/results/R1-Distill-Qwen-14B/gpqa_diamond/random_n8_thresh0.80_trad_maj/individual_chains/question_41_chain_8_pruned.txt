Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, so in a vacuum, light speed is c=1. In the glass, normally, the speed of light would be v_glass = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I remember something about relativity here. Oh right, because we're dealing with velocities that might not be negligible compared to c, but wait, in this problem, c is 1, so maybe v is small compared to 1? Not sure yet.

Wait, but wait, when the medium is moving, it's about how the light's speed is measured in the lab frame. So the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. So the speed of light in the glass is v_glass = c/n in the glass's rest frame. But the glass is moving, so in the lab frame, how do we add these velocities?

Ah, right! This is a case where I probably need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because if the medium (glass) is moving relative to the lab, and light is moving through it, the observed speed in the lab should consider both the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass frame.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula is for when you have velocities in different frames. So, let's think about frames. The lab is one frame, and the glass's rest frame is another frame moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_glass = 1/n. But since the glass is moving towards the observer, which direction is it? Hmm, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, meaning towards the observer as well. So, if the glass
