Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orientation of the orbit.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but I don't think mass directly affects the transit probability. Oh wait, the probability is mainly about the alignment of the orbit and the size ratio between the planet and star.

Wait, transit probability is highest when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but actually, wait no, I think it's more about the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, the geometric probability of a transit is something like (R_star) / (a * (1 - e)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it's (R_star)/(a). But no, wait, the planet's orbital distance is 'a', and if the star's radius is R*, then the planet would have to be within R* of the line of sight for a transit. So the probability is approximately (R* / a), right? Because if the planet's orbit is edge-on, the chance that it passes in front is proportional to R* divided by a, the semi-major axis.

Wait, actually, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_*/a). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbit, as viewed from Earth, is aligned such that the planet crosses in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the area where this can happen to the total possible area in the sky. I think the probability is (R_*/a). So if a is the distance from star to planet, and R* is star radius, then the probability is (R_*/a). But wait, I'm not confident. Let me consider another approach.

Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_*/a) Ã— (some factor based on inclination), but since the RV method already detects the planet, the planet's orbit is likely not face-on, but the RV method only gives a minimum mass because it relies on the Doppler shift depending on
