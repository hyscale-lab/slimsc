Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to walk through my thoughts step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Then, we have to determine the final product from the given options. The data given are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of compound X.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretch or maybe an alkyne. Then 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs, so there's probably an aromatic ring involved.

Next, the NMR data. Starting with the chemical shifts:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a singlet, broad, around 10.5. Hmm, that's high. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12, but they're usually broad because they exchange easily. But wait, the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 cm-1 for O-H, unless the broad region 3400–2500 is that. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe an alpha proton to a carbonyl, but that's usually lower. Hmm. Wait, another thought: if the compound has a ketone, but that doesn't explain the 10.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton attached to a carbonyl group? Or perhaps an enol tautomer? Not sure yet.

Looking at the other peaks:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, probably aromatic protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene. The two protons are equivalent in a para-substituted ring, so they split into a doublet.

-7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe the other two protons on the ring. So that would fit with a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents: one is an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and the other is some other group. Wait, in para substitution, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH adjacent to something, like a CH connected to a carbonyl? Or part of an isopropyl group? Or perhaps a methine group next to an oxygen or another substituent.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Could be a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe part of a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H, but wait, no. It's a doublet, so maybe a CH2CH2 group or a CH2 connected to another CH2. Wait, 1.4 and triplet? Oh no, wait, 1.4 is a doublet, so maybe a CH2CH(CH2R) group, where the CH is split into a doublet due to coupling with adjacent groups.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a terminal CH3 group, like at the end of a chain.

Putting this together: The aromatic part suggests a benzene ring with substituents. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks are each a doublet of two protons, so perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene. So for example, substituents at the para positions, each with two protons each. Wait, no, because in para substitution, each substituent would have two protons if they're -CH2- groups or something. Alternatively, maybe a substituent like a carbonyl which deactivates the ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to imagine the structure. Let's think about the 10.5 ppm peak. If that's a carboxylic acid proton, then the compound might be a benzoic acid derivative. So the NMR would have a peak around 10 ppm for the -COOH proton, but wait, benzoic acid's proton is typically around 10.5-12 ppm, yes. If that's the case, the IR would show a strong O-H stretch, but in the IR data, the 3400–2500 cm-1 region is broad, but I'm not sure if that's just O-H or something else. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the IR would have a strong peak around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretches, but the given IR doesn't specify that. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which fits a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or aldehyde or carboxylic acid. But for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but it can vary. So perhaps that's the case.

If we have a para-substituted benzene, with substituents at the para positions. Let's say, one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an acid) and maybe a branched alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR:

The aromatic protons are d and d, so perhaps the substituents are in para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So for example, if the substituents are a carbonyl group and an isopropyl group or something.

Wait, but the substituent with the 10.5 ppm proton could be a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring. So that would make the benzene ring have a COOH group at one position and another substituent at the para position.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show a broad peak that integrates to one proton. Let me check the H NMR again: 10.5 (bs, 1H), so just one proton. That fits a carboxylic acid because the -COOH has one proton. So that suggests that the substituent is a -COOH group.

Wait, but if the substituent is para, then the other substituent is perhaps an isopropyl or another group.

Looking at the other protons:

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH connected to something else. Like a CH in a CH2CH2 chain. Or maybe a CH in an isopropyl group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Like a CH2 connected to a carbonyl group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH. So maybe a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2?

Wait, but let me think about the overall structure. Let's say we have a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4 (para) and a substituent at position 1 (but actually, numbering might not matter as it's para). So the substituent at position 1 could be a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me see, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, I think I'm mixing up terms. Let me correct that. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, actually, wait: the substituent's structure is based on butane. The substituent could be a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's actually iso-butyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl chain with a branch. Let's think about the NMR multiplet at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Maybe this is a propyl chain connected in some way. Let me think about a possible structure.

If the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring, then perhaps the structure would have a CH(CH2CH3)2 group. Wait, but that's a tertiary butyl group, not iso-butyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pentyl group or a propyl.

Wait, let me think about the integration. The 10.5 ppm peak is 1H, the aromatic peaks are 2H each, so each substituent on the benzene has two protons. Wait no, the aromatic protons are each 2H, but that's because they're a doublet. So in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent would have two adjacent protons, but no, actually, if the substituent is a single group, the adjacent protons would be two, but that would require perhaps substituents with two protons each. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, but that would be more in line with the 1720 cm-1 IR peak. So if the substituent is a ketone, like a benzophenone derivative, but then the 10.5 ppm peak would be something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or acid) and another substituent which is a branched alkyl group.

Looking at the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH connected to another CH2 and to a carbonyl. For example, maybe it's a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- something? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in such a way that the CH group is between two CH2 groups. But the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a triplet for a CH2CH3 group, but wait, no, it's a doublet. So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not certain.

Another approach: Let's look at the options provided.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so options C and A are benzoic acids, whereas B and D are substituted benzene rings with alkyl groups.

So, looking at IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl from a benzoic acid (option C) or a ketone.

But if it's a benzoic acid, the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is present in the given data. So, the 3400–2500 cm-1 region is probably the O-H stretch for the acid. Let me think about that.

So, if the compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Wait, but let's check the NMR. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, what would the NMR look like?

A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait: the substituent is a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, wait. Let me correct: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, but that would be a four-carbon group attached as CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The structure of iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, so that's a tertiary butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but wait, no: the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's a five-carbon group. Wait, no, but butyl is four carbons. So, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that's impossible because that would be five carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, butyl groups: the four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon.

So, for sec-butyl, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- but that's five carbons. Wait, no, wait: butyl is four carbons. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that's four carbons? Let me think:

Butyl group: four carbons.

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-
- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2 (but that's a branching on the second carbon)
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that's only three carbons. Hmmm, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting the terminology wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of sec-butyl. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up, but I'll try to remember.

Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that would be a five-carbon group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's five carbons as well. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch. For example, CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that's a iso-propyl group, not butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group? No, but the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but that's a different structure.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the substituent is a butyl group, but I'm not entirely sure about the branching.

So, if the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

Looking at the NMR for such a structure:

The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, as the substituents are para. The COOH proton is at 10.5 ppm, which matches the NMR.

The other protons would come from the sec-butyl group. Let me think about the possible NMR signals.

The structure for sec-butyl is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that's a four-carbon chain attached via the second carbon. So, the substitution pattern would be:

The benzene ring is attached to the middle carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, the group would be: benzene ring connected to CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, that's not possible because with four carbons, the substituent would be: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's three carbons after the benzene, making the substituent four carbons in total.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out:

Benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH group that's connected to two CH2CH3 groups. No, wait, that would be a quaternary center, which would be a tert-butyl group, but that's not sec-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, which would be a butyl group with the substituent on the third carbon. Hmm, but that's n-pentyl, not butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, attached to the benzene is CH2, which is attached to CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, that's a four-carbon group, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH group in a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. The adjacent CH2 groups would show up around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). 

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group. So, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- structure.

Wait, but let's see: in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the CH group would have neighboring CH2 and CH(CH2CH3) groups. The NMR would show the CH group as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 would show up around 1.7 ppm, and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm (3H). So that's a -CH2CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group at the end.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, but let's look at the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the NMR would be:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (position 1): Maybe around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (1H), but that doesn't fit. Wait, no, the CH2 group would be two protons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That's a classic reaction for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, but wait, no: red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. Wait, but if X is an acid chloride, treating it with red phosphorus and HI would convert it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in that case, what would X be? An acid chloride, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe X is an ester, but the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would lead to cleavage of the ester to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acyl chloride, and the reaction is hydrolysis. But wait, the product options don't include a chloride, so perhaps X is something else.

Wait, but the problem states that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form the product. So the product is the result after this reaction. So perhaps X is an acyl chloride.

Wait, but looking at the data, if X is an acid, such as benzoic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, if X is an ester, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR and IR data for X would then be of the ester, and the product would be the acid.

Wait, but the question is about the product. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the reaction is between X and red phosphorus plus HI. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. The reaction is typically:

RCOCl + P(HI) → RCOOH + PCl3↑ + HI.

So if X is an acid chloride, then the product would be the corresponding carboxylic acid.

So, looking at the options, the products are either substituted benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings with alkyl groups.

So, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would be the product if X were the corresponding acid chloride.

Wait, but the reaction is X + red phosphorus and HI → product. So if the product is a carboxylic acid, then X must have been the corresponding acid chloride.

But let me look at the data of X. If X is an acid chloride, its IR would show a strong peak around 1800 cm-1 due to the C=O. But the given IR has 1720 cm-1, which is more typical for an ester or a ketone. So perhaps I was wrong, and X isn't an acid chloride.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would cleave the ester to give a carboxylic acid. For example, an ester RCOOR' would hydrolyze to RCOOH and R'OH.

So, if X is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, C is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps X is the corresponding ester.

So, if X is the ester, then its structure would be RCOOR', where R is the aryl group, and R' is an alkyl group.

But wait, let me think about the NMR of X (the ester). The ester group would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR data.

So, the ester would have a structure like RCOOR', and when hydrolyzed, it would form RCOOH and R'OH.

So, the product would be a carboxylic acid, which in the options is option C or A.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So perhaps X was the ester, which upon hydrolysis gives this acid.

Now, let's think about the NMR of X (the ester). The ester would have a carbonyl, but the NMR would show the ester oxygen's adjacent protons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NMR data is for the product, but no, the question says X has the given data, and the reaction is X → product.

Wait, the question says X has the given data. So, X is the starting material, and the product is formed after reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

So, if X is an ester, and the product is the acid, then the NMR data corresponds to X, the ester.

So, the NMR data would include the ester's protons.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, but then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyne, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe X is a vinyl group, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are also used in the substitution of halides. For example, in the formation of alkanes from alkyl halides, but that's usually with H-I and a metal like zinc.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is an acyl chloride, which when treated with red phosphorus and HI, would undergo hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is an acyl chloride, then its IR would have a strong peak around 1800 cm-1, but in the given data, the carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester or a ketone. So maybe X isn't an acyl chloride.

Another possibility: Maybe X is an alkyne. The IR peak at 3400–2500 could be a C≡C stretch. The 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl, but that might not fit. Or perhaps the IR is showing both the C≡C and the carbonyl.

Wait, the IR shows 3400–2500 which is a broad region. That could be an alkyne's sp-hybrid C-H stretch, which appears around 3300 cm-1.

So, X could be an alkyne with a carbonyl group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. So, if X is the acid chloride, the product is the acid. But the IR data of X would then have a strong peak around 1800 cm-1, but the given data has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which doesn't fit. So perhaps X is an ester.

If X is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Let's see which of the options is a carboxylic acid. Options A and C are acids, B and D are benzene rings with alkyl substituents.

So, perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid in option C.

But then, let's look at the NMR of X. The H NMR would show the ester's CH3COO group, but I don't see signals that fit that.

Wait, maybe X is a tertiary butyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenyl ester.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoyl chloride, which upon hydrolysis gives benzoic acid. But the product in option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, so X must have been the corresponding chloride.

But then, the NMR data of X (the chloride) would not have a broad peak at 10.5 ppm since the chloride is an acid chloride and doesn't have an -OH proton.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR data again.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is likely an -OH proton, but in an acid, that would be present. Wait, but if X is the acid, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? That doesn't seem right because red phosphorus and HI typically don't react with acids.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aldehyde. But then the IR would show a peak around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which I don't see in the given data.

Wait, let me think about another angle. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps a propyl chain ending with a CH3.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2, perhaps part of a larger substituent.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group in the middle of a chain, adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a propanoyl group attached to a butyl group.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

If X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form this, what would X be?

Wait, the reaction of an acid chloride with red phosphorus and HI gives a carboxylic acid. So, if the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then X must be the corresponding acid chloride: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride.

But then, the IR of X would have a strong peak around 1800 cm-1, which isn't present. So, perhaps X isn't an acid chloride.

Alternative approach: Maybe the reaction isn't hydrolysis. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the substitution of halides. For example, in the preparation of alkanes from alkyl halides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is an alkyne, and the reaction forms an alkene. But the product options don't include alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride, but that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Let me try to approach the problem differently. Let's analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of X.

The aromatic region has two doublets: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene, where each substituent is causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So, for example, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear downfield.

The 10.5 ppm peak is likely a carboxylic acid proton, as that's a typical shift for -COOH. But wait, in the IR, the broad region 3400–2500 cm-1 could correspond to the O-H stretch of the acid. So, X might be a benzoic acid derivative.

If X is a benzoic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not make sense, unless X is an ester.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. So, if X is, say, ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then upon hydrolysis, it would form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-Et (where Et is ethyl), attached to a benzene ring which also has a sec-butyl group in the para position.

But wait, the NMR data of X (the ester) would show the ethyl group's protons.

Looking at the NMR data:

The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group, which would be the end of an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2, perhaps part of a longer chain.

But in the case of ethyl ester, the ethyl group would show a triplet around 4.1 ppm (the OCH2CH3 group), which isn't present in the given NMR data. So perhaps the ester group isn't an ethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. But I'm not seeing the expected peaks for that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, and the NMR signals are from the butyl chain.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH group, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH group.

So, putting this together, the substituent could be a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to the benzene ring and to two CH2 groups, one of which is connected to a CH3.

Wait, that would be a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a straight chain. Alternatively, it's a branched substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure of X (the ester) would be O
|| 
O-C-O-R attached to the benzene ring, which has a sec-butyl group in the para position.

If X is an ester, its IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, which matches. The O-H stretch (if it's an acid) isn't present in the IR, but wait, the data shows a broad region from 3400–2500, but that could be the O-H of the ester? No, because esters don't have O-H. Unless X is a carboxylic acid, but then the IR data would have a strong O-H around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is in the broad region.

Wait, but if X is a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is present. So perhaps X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, but the options don't include any esters. The options are either substituted benzene rings or benzoic acids.

So, perhaps X is the benzoic acid, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts it into something else. But I'm not sure what reaction that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde, but then the IR would show the aldehyde carbonyl around 1700 cm-1 and the aldehyde C-H stretch around 2800 cm-1, which isn't clearly indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 is due to an alkyne, and the 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. But then, what reaction would X undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another possibility: X is a ketone. The IR would show the carbonyl, and perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the ketone is converted into something else. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is a nitrile. The 1720 cm-1 could be a nitrile's C≡N stretch, but that's usually around 2200 cm-1. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the 3400–2500 cm-1 is due to a C-H stretch in an alkyne. Alkyne C-H stretches are around 3300 cm-1. So, maybe X contains an alkyne.

If X contains an alkyne, then perhaps the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a hydration reaction. For example, an alkyne may be hydrated to a ketone. But then the product would be a ketone, which doesn't directly match the options.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a hydrohalogenation of the alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product might be a substituted benzene with an alkyl group, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl ester, which upon reaction forms something else.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Given the NMR data, the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted benzene, with substituents that cause the protons to split into doublets. So, substituents like -COOH and another group in the para position.

The 10.5 ppm peak is probably the -COOH proton. So, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position.

The substituent's NMR signals:

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group.

At 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 group attached to a CH.

And a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H): another CH3 group.

Wait, that suggests a longer chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with branching.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a butyl group where the chain has a branch, like a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the benzoic acid group is in the para position.

So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But wait, if X is that acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't make sense because it's already a carboxylic acid. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another possibility: X is an ester, and the product is the acid. So, X is ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, which upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI gives 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But then, the NMR data of X (the ester) would show the ethyl group's protons, which typically appear as a quartet around 4 ppm and a triplet around 1.3 ppm. But in the given NMR data, there's no such signal. Instead, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would be the end of a longer chain, perhaps a propyl group.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to match the options with the data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's see if its structure aligns with the data.

The benzoic acid would have a carbonyl group, so the IR at 1720 cm-1 is correct. The O-H stretch in the IR would be the broad region around 3400–2500 cm-1, which fits.

The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the data. The 10.5 ppm peak is the -COOH proton, which is correct.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have the following NMR signals:

- The CH group in the middle of the chain (sec-butyl) would appear as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The adjacent CH2 groups would appear around 1.7 ppm (2H) as a multiplet.

- The terminal CH3 group would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm (3H).

Additionally, the CH3 attached to the CH group would appear as a doublet around 1.4 ppm (3H), as it's attached to the CH.

So, the NMR data fits option C.

But wait, if X is the benzoic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI doesn't make sense. So perhaps X is the ester, and the product is the acid.

In that case, the NMR data would be of X (the ester), which doesn't match because the ester's NMR would have different peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, but the IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different type of reaction. Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where X is an aryl halide, and the product is a substituted benzene.

Wait, but the product options include both substituted benzene rings and benzoic acids.

Let me think again.

If the reaction is X (the ester) reacting with red phosphorus and HI to form the acid, then X must be an ester. The ester's NMR would have the ethyl group's signals, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid with an alkyl group, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps X is an acyl bromide or chloride, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, but I don't think so.

Wait, the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI could be a substitution, converting an alkyl halide into an alkane. But then the product would be a substituted benzene without the halide.

But the options for the product are either substituted benzene rings or benzoic acids.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction replaces the chloride with a hydrogen. But then the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (option D), which is a substituted benzene.

But then, the NMR of X (the chloride) would have different peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction is a reduction to form a benzyl alcohol, but I'm not sure.

This is getting quite tangled. Perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option C, based on the NMR and IR data, and that the reaction converts an ester into a carboxylic acid.

But if X is the ester, the NMR data doesn't align with that. Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, considering all the clues, the structure that seems to fit the NMR data is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the IR shows O-H and carbonyl, the NMR shows the aromatic protons as doublets, the -COOH proton, and the substituent's CH, CH2, and CH3 groups.

Therefore, the correct product is option C.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between compound X and red phosphorus and HI, based on the given IR and NMR data of X. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely an O-H stretch), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group), and 1610–1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely a carboxylic acid proton), two doublets in the aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, indicating a para-substituted benzene), and signals for a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, m), and CH₃ groups (1.4 ppm, d, and 0.9 ppm, t).

The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) suggest hydrolysis, typically converting an ester or acid chloride into a carboxylic acid. However, the IR data does not strongly support the presence of an acid chloride (no peak around 1800 cm⁻¹). Instead, the IR and NMR data align with X being a benzoic acid derivative, specifically 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The NMR signals match the expected structure: the aromatic protons correspond to a para-substituted benzene, the 10.5 ppm peak is the carboxylic acid proton, and the remaining signals correspond to the sec-butyl group.

The reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI likely involves hydrolysis, but since X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not change the structure. Thus, the final product is the same as X, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.
