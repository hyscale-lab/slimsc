Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. It says to ignore the rest, so I guess beyond δ₄ we don't consider any higher phase shifts. They're asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the partial waves and phase shifts. The general formula I recall is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ)

Where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, the problem is specifically asking about the imaginary part along the incident direction. So θ would be 0°, because along the incident beam direction, the scattering angle is zero. 

Wait, but when θ is zero, what happens to the Legendre polynomials P_l(cosθ)? Because cos(0°) is 1, so for each l, P_l(1) is 1. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 give 1 for each l. So P_l(1) = 1 for any l.

So the expression simplifies when θ=0. Then f(0) becomes (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) * 1.

But wait, I'm trying to find the imaginary part of f(0). Let's expand that expression. The amplitude f is a complex quantity, and we need its imaginary part.

So, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Let me write this as (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} ].

But e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So multiplying by sin δ_l:

sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) [ sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ] / k.

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term. That is, (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, because the real parts would be the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l, but since the question asks for the imaginary part, I only need the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l times 1/k.

So, the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) sin² δ_l.

Now, I need to compute this sum for l=0 to l=4, since the phase shifts given are up to δ₄.

Let me list the phase shifts and their corresponding l:

- δ₀ =90° → l=0
- δ₁=67° → l=1
- δ₂=55° → l=2
- δ₃=30° → l=3
- δ₄=13° → l=4

So, for each l from 0 to 4, I'll compute (2l+1) * sin(δ_l)^2.

Let me compute each term step by step.

For l=0: (2*0 +1) =1. sin(90°)=1 → sin^2=1. So term is 1*1=1.

l=1: 2*1+1=3. sin(67°) ≈ let me calculate. 67 degrees. So sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So sin^2 is (0.9205)^2 ≈ 0.8473. Multiply by 3: 3*0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192. Square is ~0.6710. Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3: 2*3+1=7. sin(30°)=0.5. Square is 0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4: 2*
