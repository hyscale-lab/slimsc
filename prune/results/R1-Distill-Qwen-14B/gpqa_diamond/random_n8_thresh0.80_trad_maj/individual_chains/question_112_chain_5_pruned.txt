Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Okay, the question involves an electron state described by |alpha>, which is a linear combination of |up> and |down> states. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively. The problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator and the average value of that operator. 

Wait, the operator's matrix is given by Aij, where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, let me write that out. If the operator is 2x2, then the matrix would look like:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because when i≠j (so the off-diagonal elements), Aij is hbar/2, and the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So this matrix would correspond to a spin operator, but not the standard Sz operator which is diagonal. Oh wait, this looks like the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Right, so the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator A. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 multiplied by hbar/2.

Wait, but the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So its eigenvalues are (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But the question is about finding the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So, I think that the state |alpha> needs to be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A. Then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will be the probabilities.

Wait, but first, let me write |alpha> properly. The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, let me compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. But wait, is this already normalized, or do I need to normalize it?

I think I should find the normalization factor first. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

So, coefficient for |up> is (1+i), its magnitude squared is |1+i|^2 = 1^2 +1^2 = 2.

Coefficient for |down> is (2 - i), so |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So to normalize, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A.

The eigenstates of A (since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x) are |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, I can write |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

First, let's let |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

But since |+x> and |−x> are orthonormal, I can find a and b by taking inner products.

Alternatively, I can write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>, then substitute using the expressions for |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write |alpha> in terms of the basis of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me try that. So,

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |−x>.

But I can express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x> ) / sqrt(2),
|down> = (|+x> − |−x> ) / sqrt(2).

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> + |−x> ) / sqrt(2) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> − |−x> ) / sqrt(2).

Let me factor the 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7) out.

So,

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |+x> / sqrt(2) 
          + [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |−x> / sqrt(2).

Combine the terms:

Compute the coefficients for |+x> and |−x>:

Coefficient for |+x>:
[ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

(1+i +2 -i) equals 3. So 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Coefficient for |−x>:
[ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

(1+i -2 +i) equals (-1 + 2i). So (-1 +2i)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

So, |alpha> = [3/(sqrt(14))] |+x> + [ (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) ] |−x>.

Wait, sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(14), yeah.

So now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients.

First, for |+x>:

|3/(sqrt(14))|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

For |−x>:

| (-1 +2i) /sqrt(14) |^2 equals ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, so the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. 

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is one of the options—option A is 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is around 0.36.

So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of the answer would be 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and the third part is hbar/7. So that's one possibility.

But let me not get ahead of myself. Let me make sure I did that correctly.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me check my substitution again.

Wait, the initial state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So, when I express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, I have:

|alpha> = [ (1+i +2 -i) / sqrt(14) ] |+x> + [ (1+i - (2 -i)) / sqrt(14) ] |−x>.

Wait, the coefficients are:

For |+x>:
(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3. So 3/(sqrt(14)).

For |−x>:
(1 + i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i. So (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So yes, that's correct.

So the squared magnitudes:

|3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

| (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So that's the first part done. Now, the second part is the average value of the operator A.

The operator A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, respectively.

So the expectation value <A> is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Let me compute that:

= [9/14 * (hbar/2)] + [5/14 * (-hbar/2)].

= [ (9 -5) * hbar/(28) ]

= (4 hbar)/28 = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, the options are:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that fits. So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state of the electron, \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The first step is to normalize this state. The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

The total norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This operator corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix.
