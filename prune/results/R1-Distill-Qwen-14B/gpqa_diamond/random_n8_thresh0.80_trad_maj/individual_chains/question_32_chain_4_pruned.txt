Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3. Wait, but if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because the atomic number is 3 (protons) plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Oh yeah, so the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

So the problem is about calculating the kinetic energy or the total energy of the ion when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Wait, the question says 'energy' but in particle physics contexts, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy per particle, or sometimes the total energy (which includes rest mass). Hmm, but I think RHIC collides heavy ions, so they have high kinetic energy.

Wait, the energy given in the options is in GeV. So I need to find the total energy or the kinetic energy. Wait, the formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m0 c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m0 c². So which one are they asking for?

The problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." Hmmm. Typically, in colliders, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused. Well, let's proceed step by step.

First, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6 for Li-6. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. So the mass of the nucleus is about 6 u. But wait, wait, the actual rest mass of a nucleus is a little less than A u because of binding energy. But for heavy ions like Li, the mass defect is small, so maybe I can approximate it as 6 u for simplicity. But wait, the exact rest mass is needed for accurate calculation, so perhaps I should look it up. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the approximation.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to take the mass as the mass number times the u, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can get the exact rest mass of Li-6. Let me think: the atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.015 g/mol. So the molar mass is about 6.015 g/mol, so the mass of one Li-6 nucleus would be approximately (6.015 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number) in kg.

Wait, Avogadro's number is about 6.022e23 mol^-1. So the mass of one Li-6 nucleus is:

6.015 g/mol * 1e-3 kg/g = 6.015e-3 kg/mol. Then divide by Avogadro's number:

m = (6.015e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 mol^-1)
