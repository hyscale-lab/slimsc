Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they gave the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the product. Our job is to identify what compound X was from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in elimination reactions. Wait, isn't that a type of acid catalyst? Or maybe a base? Oh right, it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So when it's used in such conditions, probably in a solvent like THF or something nonpolar, maybe it's deprotonating something to form an ether or undergo elimination.

Wait, the reaction conditions are for an elimination, perhaps. Or maybe for an epoxide opening? But wait, the product's NMR is given, which is after the reaction. So maybe compound X is an epoxide (oxirane), and the reaction is opening it.

Wait, but let me think again. The reaction is compound X plus this base. So if X is an epoxide, the base might cause ring-opening. But the product's NMR doesn't show any oxygen-containing groups like -OH or anything, so perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, but wait, the reagent here is a base. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is an elimination. For example, if X is a diol, the base could dehydrate it to form an epoxide. Or maybe it's an epoxide that isn't opening but something else.

Wait, looking at the options: all the options have 'oxirane' in their names. Oxirane is another name for epoxide. So compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is treating it with a strong base. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but wait, the reagent here is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that's tricky.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the ring-opening
