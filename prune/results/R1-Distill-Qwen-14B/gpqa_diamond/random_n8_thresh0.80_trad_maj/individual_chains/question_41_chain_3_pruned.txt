Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a light beam moving through glass. The glass has an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of the light is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I need to choose the right one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when dealing with light moving through different media, the speed of light changes. The formula I remember is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, right?

But in this case, the glass is moving. So I think I need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think this has to do with the addition of velocities in special relativity or maybe just classical mechanics.

Wait, no, because the speeds involved are probably non-relativistic. The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1, so maybe they're assuming we can use the classical approach here. Or perhaps they expect us to use relativistic velocity addition. Hmm.

Let me think: when the medium (glass) is moving, the light's speed relative to the lab frame would depend on both the medium's movement and the light's speed within the medium.

So normally, in a stationary glass, the light's speed is 1/n. But if the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed relative to the lab would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass? Or is it more complicated than that?

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because velocities don't just add up in classical mechanics for light. Because light always moves at c in a vacuum, but in a medium it's slower. But when the medium itself is moving, the light's speed relative to the lab isn't as straightforward.

Let me try to break it down. Let's consider the glass's frame of reference first. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n (since v = c/n). Now, when
