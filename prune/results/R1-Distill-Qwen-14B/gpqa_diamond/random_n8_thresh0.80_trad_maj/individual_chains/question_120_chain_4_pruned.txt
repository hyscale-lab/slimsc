Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which means their density in space is the same everywhere. So how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are different inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. The number of stars in a volume should depend on how the volume changes with distance. But wait, what's the volume element in spherical coordinates?

Oh right, the volume element is 4πr² dr. So as you go to a larger radius, the volume increases with r squared. But wait, how does this translate to parallax?

Because plx is 1/d, where d is distance. So if I let plx = p, then d = 1/p. So when considering a small change in parallax, say dp, what's the corresponding change in distance?

Hmm, let's see. If p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But d = 1/p, so d squared is 1/p². So dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're dealing with absolute quantities, maybe the negative just indicates direction, so the
