--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about a genetics and molecular biology experiment, and I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're looking at their developmental fate. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making the binding site.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I've heard that the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, so it should drive expression of the ligand. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES regulatory element. IRES is Internal Ribosome Entry Site, which allows for the translation of a second ORF in the same mRNA, usually after a first one. So the ligand and receptor are probably co-expressed from the same mRNA, with the ligand expressed first, then the receptor via IRES.

Wait, but the vector has some stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, right, loxP and lox2272 are different LoxP variants. When Cre is present, it recognizes loxP sites and excises the DNA between them. So if the vector has these stop cassettes, the fusion proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) are only expressed if Cre is active to remove the stop.

So the mouse model is homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under control of SOX10 regulatory elements, meaning it's active in neural crest cells. Cre would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed with their respective fluorescent tags.

But when they looked under the confocal, no green signal. Why? The eGFP is for the receptor, so they're not seeing the receptor-eGFP. So why isn't it expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand is expressed by neural crest cells and the receptor is on the same cells, maybe autocrine? Or if on different cells, paracrine. But would that affect expression? I don't think so. The expression level might be the same regardless of whether it's paracrine or autocrine; the construct would still be expressed.

Option B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the protein isn't properly trafficked, it won't get to the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would it be stuck? Maybe a stop codon or incorrect targeting signal. But the vector is designed to have the receptor ORF followed by eGFP. So if the eGFP is not in frame, as in option D, that could cause a problem. Oh, wait, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, the fusion protein might not be made correctly. So the eGFP might not be expressed, or the receptor might not be either.

Option C) Enhancer missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. So the enhancer would be part of the promoter for the ligand. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe the ligand isn't expressed. But then, what about the receptor? The IRES is after the ligand's coding sequence, which is under a strong promoter. Without the enhancer, the ligand might not be expressed, but IRES would still function, perhaps? Or maybe if the ligand's expression is low, the IRES isn't effective. Not sure.

Option D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the ORF for the receptor is followed directly by eGFP. If they're not in frame, the reading frame would be wrong, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. The eGFP would not be correctly made, so no fluorescence. Alternatively, the entire construct could be messed up, leading the receptor to not be expressed correctly. But how does this happen? If the vector was constructed with the receptor and eGFP in the same frame, but if it's not, then the fusion wouldn't work. So the eGFP wouldn't be produced, so no green signal.

Wait, but the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would activate the Cre, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed. If the eGFP is not present, the problem is in the expression of the receptor-eGFP.

So possible problems: Cre wasn't active, but the mouse is in a wt background, and crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate the Cre in neural crest cells. Alternatively, the Cre isn't active, so the stop cassettes remain, and no expression. But the question says they're homozygous for the construct, so Cre should be active in the right cells.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct, meaning two cistrons. The first is ligand-mCherry, the second is receptor-eGFP. The ligand is under CBA, the receptor is after IRES. So when Cre is active, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

But in the setup, the stop cassette in front of the ligand is between ligand ORF and mCherry, so when Cre is active, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed as ligand-mCherry. Similarly, the stop cassette before eGFP is removed, allowing receptor-eGFP.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, so the fusion is not correct. So the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green. Alternatively, the ORF for the receptor and eGFP could be in the same frame, so the eGFP is expressed only if the ORF is correctly in frame.

Also, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed, so the construct isn't working.

Wait, the other possibility: when the mouse is homozygous for the construct, but Cre is only active in SOX10-expressing cells. So in the offspring, Cre would cause the lox sites to recombine, removing the stops. But if the construct has the loxP and lox2272 stops, and Cre is using loxP, but the second stop is lox2272. Oh wait, Cre can't recombine lox2272 sites without a specific variant, like Dre or something. Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. But Cre can't recognize lox2272. Because Cre recognizes loxP sites, which are 34 bp long with specific 13bp repeats. Lox2272 is a mutated version; I think that Cre doesn't cut lox2272, but another recombinase like Dre does. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. 

Wait, lox2272 is a loxP variant that Cre can recognize, but it's less efficient. Or is there another recombinase involved? I think that lox2272 is recognized by Cre but at a lower efficiency. Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 is a different site that Cre can't cut.

In the vector, the ligand is 5' with loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 after it. So when Cre is active, it would only cut the loxP sites, but not the lox2272. Because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So this would mean that the ligand would be expressed (since the loxP stop is removed), but the receptor-eGFP would still be under the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre can't remove. So the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed, hence no green signal.

Wait, but I thought Cre could recognize lox2272. Let me think. LoxP is 34 bp, with two 13bp repeats. Lox2272 is a mutated version which is recognized by Cre but is less efficient. Or perhaps it's the same as loxP. Alternatively, some sources say that lox2272 is a lox variant designed to be recognized by Cre but not by other recombinases. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, the vector has ligand ORF with loxP-stop, and the receptor with lox2272-stop. So if Cre is used, it can only cut loxP sites. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut. Therefore, the stop remains, preventing the receptor-eGFP from being expressed.

Ah, so the problem is that Cre can't cut the lox2272 site, so the stop remains, and the receptor isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

But wait, the question is why the green signal isn't present. So the options don't directly state this, but let's look at the options.

Option B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. That's about trafficking, but the problem here is expression in the first place.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so the eGFP isn't made. That would mean no green, but that's a construction error, not due to the Cre activity.

In the experiment, they did a Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. So in the primary culture, they probably used a transient transfection. The vector would have been transfected, and the Cre would have been active (since they used a Cre vector?), but no, in the question, the mouse model is homozygous, so they probably used this construct in mice. Wait, the experiments are a bit confusing.

Wait, the setup is that they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct, meaning the construct is present in the genome. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice (hemizygous). SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, in neural crest cells, Cre would be active, leading to the recombination of the lox sites.

But if the lox sites are loxP and lox2272, and Cre can't recombine the lox2272, then only the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's remains. Thus, the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green.

So the issue is that the lox sites are different, and Cre can't cut both. So the ligand is expressed (since loxP is cut), but the receptor isn't.

Looking at the options, none directly state that, but perhaps option C is about the enhancer. Wait, the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which relies on the upstream ORF (the ligand) being expressed. So if the promoter isn't strong for the receptor, but IRES should drive it. Alternatively, without the enhancer, perhaps the CBA promoter isn't working, so the ligand isn't expressed. But in reality, the ligand expression is dependent on the promoter, which is CBA.

Wait, but the problem is that the receptor isn't expressed. So if the enhancer is missing, maybe the CBA promoter isn't active, so ligand isn't expressed. But then, the IRES wouldn't be activated, so receptor wouldn't be expressed either. But in that case, the ligand wouldn't be expressed either. So the Western blot would show no mCherry signal either.

But the initial part of the question says that they did a Western blot after transfecting the plasmid to primary astrocytes. So the construct isn't integrated into the genome but transfected. So the plasmid has the vector. If the construct is correctly made, the CBA promoter should drive the ligand, IRES the receptor. But the stop cassettes are in place unless Cre is active.

Wait, but in the plasmid transfection, unless they co-transfected Cre, the stop cassettes would remain. So in the Western blot, they wouldn't see ligand or receptor unless the construct is correctly processed.

But the question says that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps in the plasmid, the ligand and receptor are expressed without the stop cassettes. Unless the plasmid didn't have the stop cassettes. Wait, no, the vector has the stop cassettes between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes are in place, preventing expression. So unless Cre is active, no expression. But in the plasmid, I don't think they would have co-transfected Cre. So in the Western blot, perhaps they wouldn't see any signal. But the question says that the total proteins give a signal proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the blot is working. But the specific signals for the proteins might not appear.

Wait, the question says that they used the antibodies they raised against the overexpressed proteins. So if the construct isn't expressing because the stops are in place, the antibodies wouldn't detect anything. But the question says that they did the Western blot after plasmid transfection. So unless the plasmid was designed without the stops, but that's not the case. So maybe the vector had the stops, and without Cre, the proteins aren't expressed. But the question states that after transfection, they use the antibodies to test construct expression. So that would mean that the vector is correctly expressed, but if the stops are present, the proteins wouldn't be made.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let's go back to the mouse part. The mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning the vector is inserted into the genome. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the loxP sites are cut, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But if the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre, then the receptor's stop remains, so receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, no green signal. So the issue is that Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the stop remains. But looking at the options, none directly say that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, if the ORF for the receptor is not in frame with eGFP, then the eGFP won't be expressed. So the antibody against eGFP wouldn't detect anything. But I don't know if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the lox sites are the same, but I thought lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't cut. Hmm.

Wait, the vector has ligand ORF with loxP-stop and the receptor has lox2272-stop. Cre recognizes loxP but not lox2272. So, in the mouse, when Cre is active (in neural crest cells), the ligand's stop is cut, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, hence no green signal.

So the reason is that the lox2272 can't be cut by Cre, so the stop remains, preventing receptor expression.

But looking at the options, none directly state that. So perhaps the correct option is another.

Wait, the question says that the Western blot after transfection shows a signal proportional to actin. So presumably, the construct was expressed. So in the Western, you'd see the proteins. But perhaps in the mouse, the expression is in a specific tissue, and the Western was just a control.

Wait, the main issue is that in the mouse, only the ligand is expressed (mCherry positive), but the receptor-eGFP isn't. So the confocal shows nothing green.

So the reason is the eGFP isn't expressed. The possible options are B, C, or D.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the correct orientation. For example, the lox2272 is a forward and reverse lox site. If the vector was designed with loxP in one orientation and lox2272 in the other, maybe the Cre can't do anything. But I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional in this context, so the receptor isn't expressed even after the stop is removed. But I think IRES should function if the ligand is expressed.

Wait, another thought: the vector is a bicistronic vector with the ligand first and the receptor after the IRES. The stop cassettes are after each ORF. So when Cre is active, both stops are removed. But if only the loxP is cut, leaving the lox2272 in place, then only the ligand is expressed.

Thus, the issue is that the lox2272 can't be cut, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address the issue of the lox sites. So perhaps the correct answer is D. Because if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes were not correctly removed, which is due to the lox2272 issue.

But again, the options don't directly state that. So I need to choose the best possible answer from the given options.

Looking at the options again: option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter may not be active, so ligand isn't expressed. But the CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe it doesn't need an enhancer. So perhaps option C is not the issue.

Option B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from reaching the cell surface, so no green signal. But why would it be stuck? Maybe a lack of a signal peptide or something. But the receptor is a transmembrane protein, which should have a signal for the Golgi, so it shouldn't get stuck. Unless the eGFP fusion messed it up.

Alternatively, if the eGFP is not correctly attached, it might interfere with the receptor's trafficking. But that's more about the construct's design.

Option D: receptor-eGFP not in frame. If the ORFs are not in frame, the fusion protein won't be made correctly. So the eGFP wouldn't be produced, resulting in no green signal.

So between options B, D, and maybe others.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about how the vector is constructed.

The ligand is fused to mCherry. The stop cassette is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So when the stop is removed (by Cre), the ligand and mCherry are coterminal? Or are they in frame? Hmm, maybe the ligand ORF is in frame with mCherry, so when the stop is removed, the ligand-mCherry fusion is made.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by the eGFP, with a stop cassette in between. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is fused to eGFP in frame.

If the vector was constructed correctly, then the ORFs are in frame.

But if the ORFs are not in frame, then the eGFP might not be expressed, leading to no green.

So option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

So why would that happen? Perhaps during the cloning process, the frames weren't aligned, leading to a frame shift. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly, and thus the Western blot wouldn't show the eGFP, but in the case where the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be expressed but not correctly, leading to no fluorescence.

But the question is about the confocal not showing green. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, then no green. That could be due to the stop not being removed (lox2272 issue) or the ORFs not being in frame.

But in this case, the stop is not removed (because Cre can't cut lox2272), so the eGFP ORF is still behind a stop. So in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, the problem is that the stop is still present, not that the ORFs are out of frame.

So the correct reason is that the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre, so the stop remains. But none of the options state this.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D, because the ORFs are not in frame. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the vector didn't have the Cre under a promoter, so the Cre isn't active, so the stops aren't cut. But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should provide Cre activity.

Wait, another angle: the IRES element is after the ligand, so the receptor should be expressed after the ligand. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But IRES is supposed to drive expression of the downstream gene, so if the ligand is expressed, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed too. But if the IRES is non-functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But I don't think that's the case because the vector design should include a functional IRES.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. I think the best fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, the construct is designed so that the ligand is at 5', then the IRES, then the receptor, then eGFP with a stop. But if the stop is in the way, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed. No, the stop would be in a cassette that's removed when Cre acts.

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed as ligand (with stop), then IRES, then receptor (with stop). So when Cre is active, the stops are removed, allowing ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But if the lox sites are different, perhaps Cre can't remove both stops. So in this case, the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But again, none of the options state that. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the vector requires a certain selection marker or something else, but that's not mentioned.

Alternatively, the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, but the ligand is under CBA, which is strong, so that's probably not.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. Why would that happen? If the eGFP is not correctly folded or there's a mutation in the signal sequence. But the receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it should traffic to the membrane. If eGFP is part of the C-terminus, perhaps the fusion disrupts the signal. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the problem is the stop cassette isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But what option aligns with that? The only option that suggests the construct isn't expressed is option C, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green. But that would be a problem with the construct design, not the Cre activity.

But the mouse model is homozygous, and the Cre is active. So if the stop is cut, and the ORF is in frame, eGFP should be expressed.

But perhaps the frame is correct, but the stop remains because the lox2272 isn't cut. So no eGFP.

But again, the options don't directly address that.

Wait, the answer options are:

A) ligand and receptor paracrine.

B) Receptor stuck in Golgi.

C) Enhancer missing.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame.

So the correct reason is that the stop is not removed because Cre can't cut the lox2272. But that's not an option. So perhaps the answer is D because the eGFP isn't being expressed, but that's due to the ORF being out of frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but I'm not sure why. If the enhancer is missing, the ligand isn't expressed, so the IRES isn't activated, so the receptor isn't expressed either. But in the Western blot, they would see no signals, but the question says the blot works (signal proportional to actin), so perhaps the construct is expressed.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach. The vector has a stop cassette between ligand and mCherry (loxP-stop), and another between receptor and eGFP (lox2272-stop). So when Cre is active, the loxP site is cut, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272 site is not cut by Cre, so the stop remains, preventing receptor-eGFP expression.

Thus, the reason for no green is that the stop before eGFP isn't cut by Cre, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working because the ligand isn't expressed. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which should be strong.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 is a stop cassette that isn't removed, preventing the receptor's expression. But again, no option about that.

So perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the stop cassettes are in the vector, so the ligand and receptor are only expressed when Cre is active. If the Cre isn't active, the stops remain, and nothing is expressed. But in the mouse, the Cre is SOX10-driven. So in neural crest cells, Cre should be active. But perhaps the expression isn't strong enough, so the stop isn't excised. Or perhaps the cells aren't expressing Cre, but that's unlikely since they crossed to SOX10-Cre.

Alternatively, could the Cre be present but not active? Unlikely.

Hmm.

I think the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the eGFP isn't produced, hence no green signal.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) and stop cassettes flanking each ORF. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is downstream of an IRES element. The vector includes a loxP-stop-loxP cassette upstream of mCherry and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette upstream of eGFP. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells, removing the stop cassettes and allowing expression of the ligand and receptor. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the absence of a green signal is unrelated to whether the ligand and receptor are paracrine or autocrine. The issue lies in the expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion, not its mode of action. This option does not explain the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were trafficking improperly, it would not reach the cell surface, leading to no fluorescence. However, the receptor is a transmembrane protein, and the construct design does not inherently suggest a trafficking defect. This option is unlikely unless there is a specific issue with the construct's signal sequences or folding, which is not indicated in the question.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which does not require an enhancer for expression. The receptor is downstream of an IRES, which relies on the upstream ligand for expression. While a missing enhancer could theoretically reduce ligand expression, the CBA promoter alone is sufficient for strong expression. This option does not align with the observed lack of green signal.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP ORFs are not in frame, the eGFP fusion protein would not be expressed correctly. This would result in no green signal, as the eGFP would not be produced. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of fluorescence and is a plausible issue with the construct design.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of a green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing the expression of the eGFP fusion protein. This explanation best fits the observed result and the construct design described in the question.

**Answer: D**
