Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. So, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically absorbs around 1740 cm^-1. So that's a clue that the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It has six signals. Let me break down what each part means. The first two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. Di-substituted can have different substitution patterns—like para, meta, or ortho. The splitting would depend on that. But since there are two signals, maybe it's a para substitution because that splits the ring into two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, it could be an ortho substitution, but that might give more signals. Wait, no—ortho would have two sets of two protons each, so that would be two signals. Hmm. So the aromatic region shows two peaks, which could be either para or maybe another substitution with symmetry.

Next, the NMR says two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so maybe an ester group with a vinyl group attached, like an acrylate ester. Or perhaps part of a ring structure. Wait, but it's a 6-membered aromatic ring. Let me think. Another possibility is that the substituents on the ring are ester groups with some vinyl groups. Or maybe the substituents are ester groups attached via a vinyl group.

Then, there are two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. And importantly, no –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. That suggests that any substituents are either attached directly to the ring without any CH2 bridges or have structures where CH2 groups aren't present.

Let me think about the possible structure. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, and there's an ester group, perhaps the substituents are ester groups. But wait, each substitution would be an ester. Alternatively, the substituents could be something else, but the presence of an ester suggests that.

An ester has the structure R-O-CO-R'. So considering that, maybe each substituent is an ester group. But wait, a di-ester would imply two ester groups. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else, but the question says the FTIR shows presence of an ester group, so maybe just one ester group is present.

But wait, wait. Another possibility: the substituents could be two ester groups, but perhaps each ester is a different group. Or maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The aromatic signals: two signals—could this imply two equivalent protons in each set? Like para-substituted. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons
