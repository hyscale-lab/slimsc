Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start.

Let me first look at the NMR data to figure out the structure. The NMR is given as:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Starting with the 9.72 ppm peak. That's a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm like 9.7 often indicates an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's it. So there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm peak, a doublet of 2H. That could be adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. So maybe an ethyl ester or something like that? Or perhaps a methylene group attached to an oxygen.

But wait, let me think of other possibilities. If it's a CH2 group next to oxygen, like in a glycol or an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be five rings, or a combination. Like maybe two rings and a double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, etc.

But looking at the NMR, I see several aromatic protons, so probably benzene rings. Let me count the aromatic protons in the NMR.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). That's four protons in total, which suggests two sets of doublets. That's typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe two phenyl groups attached somewhere.

Wait, but the 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet of 2H. Broad suggests exchange with something, maybe an -OH proton? But it's integrating for 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's an enol proton or a diol? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene.

Wait, another possibility: the 6.27 might be a vinyl proton adjacent to an electronegative group. Or maybe a prochiral group like in a di-substit
