Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's see what the problem says.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic compound, I think it's a cyclohexene with some substituents. Wait, noâ€”wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, so it's a bicyclic structure. Oh right, limonene is bicyclic, something like a cyclohexene fused with another ring, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, more specifically, a substituted cyclohexene. Let me think. The structure of limonene is a substituted cyclohexene. (R)-Limonene has a specific configuration; it's a chiral molecule with a particular arrangement of substituents.

So the first reaction is that the methanol solution of limonene is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That sounds like hydrogenation. Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds. So what happens when limonene undergoes hydrogenation?

Wait, limonene has a double bond. Hydrogenation would add H2 across that double bond. But wait, limonene is a cyclic terpene with a double bond in the ring structure. So hydrogenation would convert the double bond into a single bond, thus saturating the ring. So, the product after hydrogenation would be a
