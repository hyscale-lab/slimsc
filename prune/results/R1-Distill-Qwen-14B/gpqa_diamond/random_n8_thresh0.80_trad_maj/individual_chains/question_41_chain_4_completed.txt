Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because optics and relative motion can get tricky. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that a light beam is moving through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? They also mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm. Right, so the speed of light in a medium depends on the refractive index. Normally, when the medium is stationary, the speed is c/n. But here, the glass is moving. So I think I need to consider both the speed of light in the medium and the motion of the medium itself.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the speed of the light relative to the lab frame. The glass is moving, so perhaps I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula? Because velocities don't just add up linearly when dealing with significant fractions of the speed of light.

Wait a second, but v is the velocity of the glass. The light is moving through the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. But the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So the observer would see the light's speed as the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass, but not exactly. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add like that. Oh right, the relativistic formula is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the velocity in the medium's frame. Wait, but wait, u' in this case is the speed of light in the glass, which is c/n. Since c=1, that's 1/n.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light inside the glass has speed v1 = c/n = 1/n. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v1. But from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so we need to find the lab frame's measurement of the light's speed.

Wait, wait a minute. The light is in the glass. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v towards the observer. The light in the glass is moving at (1/n) relative to the glass. But the direction is the same as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (v + (1/n)) / (1 + (v*(1/n)) ) because of the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, let me think about that. The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ). Since u' is the velocity of the object in the moving frame, which is the glass's frame. But in this case, the object is the light, moving at v1 = 1/n (since c=1) relative to the glass. So u' is 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab will see the light's speed as u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) ), because the denominator is 1 + (u' v)/c², and since c is 1, it's just 1 + (u' v).

Wait, but wait again. The problem is the direction. The glass is moving towards the observer. So if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, then both velocities are in the same direction. So u' is positive, and v is positive as well.

So putting it all together, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Wait, let's compute that:

u = [v + (1/n)] / [1 + (v / n) ]

Hmm, let's see if that matches any of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 + n v) / (n + v) → Let me compute that. Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Wait, actually, let me think about the expression I have. Let me write it as [ (v n +1 ) / n ] / [ (n + v) / n ] → The denominator n cancels, so it's (v n +1)/(n + v) → which is (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's option A.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab is what we're calculating. But wait, in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but the speed of the light in the lab frame cannot exceed c. So for the expression we've derived, does it make sense?

Wait, let's test for a case where n=1 (vacuum) and v=0. Then the speed is (1 + 0)/(1 + 0) =1, which is correct. If the glass is stationary and n=1, then speed is 1, correct.

Another test: If n=2, and v is very small compared to c (which is 1 here). Then u ≈ ( (1/2) + v ) / (1 + (v/2) ) ≈ (1/2 + v) (1 - v/2) ) using 1/(1+x) ≈1-x for small x. So (1/2 + v)(1 - v/2 ) ≈ 1/2 + v - (1/2) v^2 - v²/2. Wait, but for small v, the dominant terms are 1/2 + v. So the speed would be around (1/2 + v). But wait, considering that when the medium moves towards the observer, if the medium is moving in the same direction as the light (as in this case), the light's speed as observed would be higher than c/n. But in reality, the speed can't exceed c. So in this scenario, if v is large, say, 1 (but that's not possible, because v can't reach c). But let's take v=0.9 and n=2.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So according to the calculations, the correct expression is (1 +n v)/(n +v) which is option A. But wait, let me think again about the setup.

Wait, no, wait. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n, which is 1/n. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at v towards the observer, and the light in the glass is moving at (1/n) in the same direction. So the lab observes the light's speed as (v + (1/n)) / (1 + (v (1/n))/c² ), but since c=1, it's (v + (1/n)) / (1 + v/(n) )

Which is the same as [n v +1 ] / (n + v) → (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but I've heard that in relativity, the speed of light remains c in all frames, but that's only when light is in a vacuum. But when it's in a medium, like glass, the speed is different. So the speed of the light in the medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, the observed speed might be different.

Wait, but according to the theory, the speed of light in a medium is c/n only in the rest frame of the medium. When the medium is moving, you have to consider the relativistic velocity addition. So the formula I used earlier should be correct.

But wait, another approach: Let me think about the refractive index. The refractive index is n = c / v_light_in_medium. So v_light_in_medium = c/n, which is 1/n here. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But because the medium is moving, the lab frame would see it at a different speed.

So applying the relativistic velocity addition, the lab frame would measure the light's speed as:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Where u' is 1/n, and v is the velocity of the medium towards the lab.

So, substituting:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Which simplifies to (1 + n v) / (n + v ), because multiplying numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: (1 + n v )

Denominator: n (1) + v n → Wait, no. Wait, The denominator is 1 + (v/(n)), multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: (1/n + v) * n = 1 + n v

Denominator: [1 + (v/n)] *n = n + v

So yes, the same as before.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. So for the observer, the light is moving towards them, which could influence the direction. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab's perspective, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass. So if the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards the observer, then the light is moving towards the observer, not away. Wait, no, because the light is in the glass and moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the light's direction is the same as the glass's velocity. So for example, if the glass is moving to the right (towards the observer), then the light is moving to the right as well.

But the question is about the speed, not the direction. So the formula should still apply.

Wait, but let's think about the direction in terms of signs. Let's say the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So for the observer in the lab, the glass is approaching. The light in the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So both the glass and the light are moving in the same direction (towards the observer), so the velocities add.

Wait, but in the formula, when velocities are in the same direction, you add them, but you have to account for the relativistic effect. So yes, the formula is correct.

So the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, another thought: if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, then the speed of the light relative to the lab would be higher than c/n. But wait, if v is significant, could that speed exceed c?

Wait, let's test with some numbers. Let me take n=1 (so the glass is vacuum, which doesn't make sense, but let's see), and v=0.5. Then the formula gives (1 + (1)(0.5)) / (1 + 0.5) = (1.5)/(1.5)=1. So the speed is 1, which is correct because in vacuum, the speed of light is c regardless of the frame.

Another example: n=2, v=0.5.

u = (1 + 2*0.5 ) / (2 + 0.5 ) = (2)/(2.5 )= 0.8. Which is less than c=1. That makes sense because in the medium, the speed is already 0.5 (since 1/2=0.5), and the medium is moving at 0.5. So the observer would see the light moving at 0.8, which is faster than 0.5 but still less than c. That seems reasonable.

Another test: n=2, v=0.9.

u = (1 + 2*0.9 ) / (2 + 0.9 ) → (1 +1.8) /2.9 → 2.8/2.9 ≈ 0.9655. Which is less than c, as expected.

So the formula gives a valid speed.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must account for both the refractive index of the glass and the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)). The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. 

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u' \) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass (\( u' = \frac{1}{n} \)), and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator by multiplying through by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches the expression given in option A. Testing with specific values (e.g., \( n = 1 \), \( v = 0 \), and \( n = 2 \), \( v = 0.5 \)) confirms that the formula is consistent with the expected behavior of light speed in special relativity and does not exceed \( c \).

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This corresponds to option A.
