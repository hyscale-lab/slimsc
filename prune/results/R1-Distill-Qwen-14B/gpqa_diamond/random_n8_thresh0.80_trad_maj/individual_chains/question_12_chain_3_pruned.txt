Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. So the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, mu(+) and nu.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? Or is it considered massless in these kinds of problems? Oh right, in many cases, especially when the masses are given, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So maybe I can treat it as massless here. That simplifies things a bit.

So, the Pi meson is initially at rest, which means the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the muon and the neutrino will move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Let's start with energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi meson, which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is massless, so its energy is just its kinetic energy (since E = pc for massless particles). The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy.

Wait, no. The muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. So let's denote:

E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu
E_nu = K_nu (since m_nu ≈ 0)

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

This must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So equation 1: 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6

Which simplifies to K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

Now, for momentum conservation. The Pi meson is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The momentum of a particle is given by p = gamma m v, but for the muon, which has mass, the relativistic momentum is p = gamma m v. For the neutrino, since it's massless, p = E_nu / c.

Wait, but in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c²), momentum p is in MeV/c. So for the muon, p_mu = gamma m_mu v. Alternatively, p_mu = sqrt( (gamma m_mu)^2 c^4 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) ) / c² ?? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of energy-momentum relations.

The energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? No, wait, E is in units of MeV. Let me just think in terms of E² = p² c^4 + m² c^4.

But since we're using MeV and MeV/c², perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1. So E² = p² + m².

So for the muon, E_mu² = p_mu² + m_mu².

E_mu is (105.7 + K_mu) MeV, because E_mu is rest energy plus kinetic energy. So,

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2.

So simplifying, (105.7 + K_mu)^2 - (105.7)^2 = p_mu^2.

Expanding the left side: (105.7^2 + 2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2) - 105.7^2 = p_mu^2.

Which simplifies to 2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = p_mu^2.

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is K_nu, and since it's massless, its momentum is p_nu = K_nu / c. Again, in natural units, p_nu = K_nu.

But wait, because the directions are opposite, the magnitudes are equal: p_mu = p_nu.

So p_mu = p_nu.

Wait, no, because the momentum vectors must be opposite. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So p_mu = p_nu.

So p_mu = p_nu = K_nu.

Wait, because for the neutrino, E = p c, but in natural units, E = p (since c=1). So p_nu = E_nu = K_nu.

Wait, no, wait: E_nu = p_nu c, so p_nu = E_nu / c. But in units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu c, so E_nu = p_nu. So p_nu = K_nu.

So, p_mu = K_nu.

But from earlier, p_mu^2 = 2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2.

So substituting p_mu = K_nu, we get:

K_nu^2 = 2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2.

And from the energy equation, K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

So we have two equations:

1) K_mu + K_nu = 33.9
2) K_nu^2 = 2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2.

Let me substitute equation 1 into equation 2.

Let me denote equation 1 as K_nu = 33.9 - K_mu.

Substituting into equation 2:

(33.9 - K_mu)^2 = 2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2.

Expanding the left side:

33.9^2 - 2 * 33.9 * K_mu + K_mu^2 = 2 * 105.7 * K_mu + K_mu^2.

The K_mu^2 terms on both sides cancel out. So:

33.9^2 - 2 * 33.9 * K_mu = 2 * 105.7 * K_mu.

Let me compute 33.9^2 first. 33.9 * 33.9. Let me calculate that. 30^2 is 900, 3.9^2 is 15.21, and the cross terms are 2 *30*3.9 = 234. So 30+3.9 =33.9. So (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So a=30, b=3.9.

So 30² = 900, 2ab= 2*30*3.9=234, b²=15.21. Summing: 900 + 234 = 1134, +15.21 is 1149.21. So 33.9^2 is 1149.21.

So 1149.21 - 2 *33.9 K_mu = 2 *105.7 K_mu.

Bring all terms to one side:

1149.21 = 2*105.7 K_mu + 2*33.9 K_mu.

Factor out K_mu on the right:

1149.21 = K_mu (2*105.7 + 2*33.9).

Compute 2*105.7 = 211.4; 2*33.9=67.8. Sum: 211.4 +67.8= 279.2.

So:

1149.21 = 279.2 * K_mu.

Then K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. Let me see:

279.2 *4= 1116.8. 114
