Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, first, let me parse the problem. There are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in relativity is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of one object as seen from the rest frame, and v is the velocity of the other object as seen from the same frame. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If I'm in the frame of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second astronaut? Or maybe I should look at it from the perspective of one astronaut to find their relative speed.

Wait, wait. Maybe it's better to first consider the frame where the combined momentum is zero, but that's for the center of momentum frame. But the problem is about the relative speed between them as observed from one of their frames. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame.

Hmm, the question says "relative speed", so I think that's the speed of one as seen from the other's rest frame. So for example, what's the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame.

So let's clarify: astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both same direction. So from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c, but that's in the non-relativistic sense. But since they're moving at a significant fraction of c, I can't just subtract their speeds like that. So I need to apply the relativistic formula.

Wait, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, that's when both velocities are in the same direction in the original frame. Oh, wait, or is that when you're changing frames? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The formula for the relative speed when you have two velocities u and v in the same frame, from which you want to find the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So if in frame S, object A is moving at u and object B at v, then in frame S' (which is moving at velocity u relative to S), the velocity of B would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, is that right? Or is it (v - u)/(1 - (
