Okay, so I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], where γ matrices are the Dirac matrices. But wait, I don't think I need to get into the specifics of σ_{μν} for calculating the mass dimension. I just need to know how each term contributes to the dimensions.

First, let's break down the structure of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is an integral over spacetime, so each term's dimension must be [Mass]^4 because the integral is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

The Lagrangian here is a product of fields and coupling constants. Let me list out the fields and their dimensions.

ψ is a spinor field. In 4-dimensional spacetime (since this is a typical QFT setup), the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is [Mass]^4, the Lagrangian density must be dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So, the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's figure out the dimensions of each part:

1. ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.
2. ψ is 3/2.
3. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. F is derived from the vector potential A, which has dimension 1. The field tensor F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so F has dimension [∂][A] = [Mass][1] = 1.
4. σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they are just matrices), so [σ_{μν}] is dimensionless.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless in QFT. So σ_{μν} is also dimensionless.

So putting it all together:

The term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 (since σ is dim 0) = 3.

Then F^{μν} has dimension 1. So the entire term without κ is [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 3 + 1 =4. Because the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4, the term κ multiplied by this would have to also have dimension 4.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The entire term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each factor's dimension is:

κ * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F]

Which is κ * (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 1.

Wait, but wait, no. The dimensions of the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} would be the sum of the dimensions of each component. Let me calculate each part:

ψ̄ has dim 3/2, σ_{μν} is dimensionless (so 0), ψ is 3/2, F is 1.

So adding them up: 3/2 + 0 +3/2 +1 = (3+3)/2 +1 = 3 +1 =4. So the term without κ is dimension 4. But the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by that. So the term is κ * (dimension 4) . But the Lagrangian has to have each term with dim 4. So for the entire term to have dim 4, κ must have dim 0? That can't be right. Or wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait no, wait. The Lagrangian is L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Each of ψ̄,
