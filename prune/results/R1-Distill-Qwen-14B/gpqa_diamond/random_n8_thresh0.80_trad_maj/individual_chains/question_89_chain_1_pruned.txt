Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and the products formed.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C to give product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with a base, they usually undergo an elimination reaction, forming alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Wait no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. So when KOH is added, it should deprotonate and eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene. Alternatively, considering the structure, maybe it's a bridge or something else.

Wait, but wait! Let me think about elimination. If both Br are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if the two Br are on non-adjacent carbons, perhaps the elimination would form a diene or a bridge. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening? No, adamantane is a very stable structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form an alkene.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might not be a vicinal dihalide. Let me draw the structure. Adamantane has a structure like four cyclohexane rings fused together. So the positions 1 and 3 would be separated by a couple of carbons. Wait, actually, I'm a bit hazy on the exact structure of adamantane. Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridge structure, so when KOH is used, it eliminates both Br and forms a conjugated diene.

Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination. Wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in excess and heat, it'll likely undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on 1 and 3. So eliminating one pair would give a double bond between 1 and 2, but then the other Br is on 3. Hmm, wait no. Let me think again. Suppose each Br is on adjacent carbons. No, 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe elimination occurs between 1 and 3? That would not be possible because they're not adjacent. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm thinking wrong about the structure. Maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the two Br on adjacent bridgehead positions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the
