Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's try to unpack it. The question says a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c divided by the index of refraction. Oh right, so normally, if the medium is stationary, the speed would be v_light = c/n. But here, the medium is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think I should consider the frame of reference here. The glass is moving, so from the lab frame, how does the light's speed change? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly because of the velocity addition formulas. But wait, this is about a medium moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's a case of Galilean relativity, which is much simpler. Because, wait, when the speed is much less than c, you can use Galilean addition, but in reality, for exact calculations, you should use the relativistic formulas.

Wait, but the options given don't look like anything involving Lorentz factors. So maybe the problem is intended to be solved using classical addition, not relativistic. So perhaps the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n, and the glass is moving at v towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be the speed of the medium plus the speed of light in the medium relative to the medium.

Wait, but wait. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the lab. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the observer in the lab. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards them. But the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving. So the light's speed relative to the glass is c/n. So the lab would see
