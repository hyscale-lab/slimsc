Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. And we need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, I think that's a typo. Benzene with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium (d) on carbon 2. So the structure would be bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent to the bromine. Wait, no, wait: benzene is a ring, so numbering would place the bromine at position 1 and the deuterium at position 2. So the molecule is para to bromine? No, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the bromine is at position 1, then position 2 is the ortho position. So the structure has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, in what context? Oh, right, aromatic substitution. So in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, especially in a polar aprotic solvent like ammonia (though ammonia is a weak base, but when condensed, perhaps it's acting as a solvent), the reaction could be a dehalogenation or maybe a deprotonation leading to some kind of elimination or coupling.

Wait, another possibility is that the deuterium is part of the molecule to track the movement of protons under certain conditions. So if the starting material has a Br and a D on adjacent carbons, perhaps the reaction involves elimination or some kind of aromatic substitution.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of aromatic dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but benzene rings are stable, so dehydrohalogenation would require specific conditions. Or maybe it's about elimination to form a double bond, but benzene is already a conjugated ring with alternating double bonds.

Wait, another thought: when you have a benzene ring with a leaving group like bromine and another substituent, perhaps under strong basic conditions, a dehydrohalogenation occurs to form a triple bond or another conjugated system. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate things. But in this case, the molecule has a deuterium at position 2. So, if the base is trying to abstract a proton, but the adjacent position is deuterated, which is harder to deprotonate because D is less acidic than H? Or wait, the acidity of protons adjacent to electronegative groups. So, if Br is electron-withdrawing, the adjacent protons would be more acidic.

But in this case, the H at position 2 is replaced by D. So the adjacent positions (like position 3) could have H's that are acidic. Wait, but the molecule is 1-bromo-2-d, so positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), and then 3 and 4 would be next.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing H and Br to form a double bond. But benzene is aromatic, so removing H and Br would form a new ring structure. Wait, but benzene is fully conjugated, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but under strong basic conditions, maybe the deuterium is not a leaving group. The Br is a leaving group, but in aromatic substitution, you usually have substitution via some mechanism. But in aromatic substitution, you need a good leaving group and activating groups. Bromine is a meta director, so it's a deactivating group, making substitution harder. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, like a Ullmann coupling, but that usually requires a copper catalyst and high temperatures. I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.

Wait, another thought: when you have a benzene ring with a Br and another substituent, and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, maybe it's a case of aromatic nucleophilic substitution. But for that to happen, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an EWG but not super strong. Also, the solvent here is ammonia, which is a weak base but can act as a nucleophile.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's deprotonating something. But the adjacent position to Br is D, which is heavier than H, making it harder to deprotonate. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton from a different position.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds. So removing H and Br would form a new ring structure, but that might not be possible.

Wait, another possibility is that the base induces elimination, forming a new ring structure. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium isn't playing a big role here. The main reaction is the substitution of Br. So when Br leaves, perhaps it's a substitution, but under what conditions?

Wait, another angle: in aromatic substitution, for a nucleophilic substitution, the ring needs to have strong EWG. Br is a moderate EWG. But in the presence of a strong base, could it lead to an elimination-addition mechanism? Like the formation of a benzyn intermediate.

Ah, wait, benzyn! That's a possibility. Benzyn (or aryne) formation. Let me think: in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, a dihalobenzene can lose two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond, a benzyn, which is a highly strained alkyne. But wait, in our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, which is a monohalobenzene. So can benzyn form in this case?

Wait, benzyn formation typically requires two leaving groups on adjacent positions. So for our molecule, perhaps if both Br and D are adjacent, but D is not a leaving group. So that's not possible. Unless the base abstracts a proton from a position next to Br, leading to elimination of Br and H to form a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is at position 2, Br at position 1. So adjacent to Br is position 2 (D) and position 6. So the base can abstract a proton from position 3 or position 6, perhaps. Wait, but position 2 is D, so position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, position 3 is H.

Wait, maybe. So NaNH2 is a strong base, and it abstracts a proton from position 3 (beta to Br). Then, the Br would leave as Br-, forming a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, if H is abstracted from C3, elimination would be between C1 and C3, which are meta positions. That might not form a benzyn.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br. So if the base takes a proton from position 6, then Br would leave, and form a double bond between C1 and C6. But that's adjacent positions, so forming a double bond between C1 and C6, which are adjacent. But benzene already has double bonds, so this would change the ring structure.

Wait, but benzene can't form a triple bond unless two adjacent H's are removed. Oh, wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 2, but position 2 is D. So that's not possible. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is next to position 2, but that's getting a bit too far.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products. If the reaction forms a benzyn (a triple bond in the ring), that's a very strained structure, so it's reactive. Benzyn can undergo various reactions, like cycloadditions or trapping with nucleophiles.

In the case where we have a monohalobenzene, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a triple bond. So, for example, if H is abstracted from position 2 (but that's D), so from position 3. Then, elimination would occur between position 1 (Br) and position 3 (now with H removed), forming a triple bond between C1 and C3? No, that's not adjacent, so maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, if a proton is abstracted from a position adjacent to the Br, like position 2 (but that's D), so perhaps position 6. Then, eliminating H and Br would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But position 2 is D, so maybe that's not possible. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by an amide group or something. But that would require a nucleophilic substitution. But in aromatic substitution, that's usually difficult unless the ring is activated. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-directing group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about substitution but about elimination. So, if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a benzyn. But for that, the Br and the abstracted H need to be on adjacent carbons. So in our case, the Br is on C1, and adjacent are C2 and C6.

C2 has a D, so can't lose a proton from there. So the only possibility is C6, which has an H. If the base abstracts a proton from C6, then elimination of Br would occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond between them. So the benzene ring would become a triple bond between C1 and C6, making it a benzyn.

But wait, benzyn is a very strained alkyne, so it's not stable, but it can react further. Once formed, the benzyn can react with other molecules or with nucleophiles. But under the reaction conditions, perhaps it can undergo some kind of dimerization or trapping.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, how many products form from this reaction?

If the benzyn is formed, perhaps it can either undergo [2+2] cycloaddition to form a bicyclic compound, or perhaps it can dimerize, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the benzyn isn't formed, and the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely as NaNH2 is a strong base.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the adjacent positions to Br are 2 (D) and 6. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then the Br would leave, and a triple bond would form between C1 and C6.

Wait, but that would form a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, which is possible but forms a triple bond in the ring, leading to a new structure. Alternatively, it could form a diradical or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps this elimination forms a benzyn, which is highly reactive and can undergo various reactions. But in the presence of ammonia as a solvent, perhaps the benzyn can undergo a ring expansion or something else.

But the problem is asking for the number of possible organic products. So, perhaps the reaction forms only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a triple bond, and under the reaction conditions, maybe the benzyn can combine with another molecule to form a dimer. But that's speculative.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Let's think about the possible products.

If the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a benzyn, perhaps the structure is benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C2 (if the H is removed from C2, but wait, that's D). So the only possibility is removing H from C6, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. So the product would be a benzyn with triple bond between C1 and C6. But how many isomers are possible?

Wait, benzyn can have different positions for the triple bond. For a benzene ring, the triple bond can be in ortho, meta, or para positions. But in our case, the triple bond would form between C1 and C6, which are adjacent. Wait, that's the same as positions 1 and 2, which are adjacent. But in numbering, 1 and 6 are adjacent as well because benzene is a six-membered ring. So the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, which is an ortho position. Alternatively, if the elimination occurs between C1 (Br) and C2 (D), but that D can't be removed, so only C6's H is available for elimination.

Wait, but the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2 (if H is removed from C2), but C2 has D. So we can't do that. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Let me number the benzene ring: position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, then position 3 would be next, and so on. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in order. So adjacent to position 1 are positions 2 and 6. So the H that can be abstracted is from position 6.

If the base abstracts the H from position 6, then elimination of Br- would occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond between them. That would create a triple bond between C1 and C6, which are ortho to each other. So the resulting structure is a benzyn where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. But in this structure, the deuterium is at C2. So the product would be a benzyn with the triple bond in the ortho position relative to D.

Wait, but would this lead to any isomers? Since the triple bond is between C1 and C6, which are specific positions, and the D is at C2, this would give a single product. So perhaps only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyn can rearrange, but I'm not sure. Or maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but I think the base is strong enough to deprotonate and cause elimination.

Wait, another possibility: if the elimination forms a triple bond, but the ring can rotate, leading to different isomers. For benzyn, the triple bond can be in different positions due to ring flexibility, but in reality, the positions are fixed. So if the triple bond is between C1 and C6, that's a specific structure.

Wait, but considering the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, and the elimination is from C1 and C6, that's the only possibility. So only one product would form. But wait, perhaps the deuterium could influence the reaction. The presence of D at position 2 might affect the acidity of adjacent protons.

Wait, the acidity of protons adjacent to deuterium... Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But in this case, the H at position 6 is what's being abstracted. The D at position 2 is on an adjacent carbon, but doesn't directly impact the acidity of position 6's H. So the base can abstract the H from position 6, leading to the benzyn.

So if only one product forms, the answer would be B)1.

But wait, could there be other possible products? For example, if the base abstracts a proton from a different position, leading to different products. But given that only H at position 6 is available adjacent to Br, I think only one product is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but I think NaNH2 is a strong enough base to induce elimination. So the product is the benzyn.

Wait, but benzyn can rearrange or have different positions of the triple bond. Wait, no. Once the triple bond forms between C1 and C6, that's a specific position, so only one product.

So the number of possible organic products is 1, so the answer is B)1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material has bromine at position 1 and deuterium (D) at position 2 on the benzene ring. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and under these conditions, it can abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination of the bromine atom and the formation of a triple bond in the benzene ring, resulting in a benzyn (aryne) intermediate.

In this case, the bromine is at position 1, and the only available proton adjacent to it is at position 6 (since position 2 has a deuterium, which is not abstractable). The base abstracts the proton at position 6, and the bromine leaves, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This creates a benzyn with the triple bond in the ortho position relative to the deuterium at position 2.

The reaction conditions favor the formation of this specific benzyn intermediate. Since there is only one possible position for the triple bond to form (between positions 1 and 6), the reaction yields a single product.

Thus, the number of possible organic products is **1**.

Answer: B
