Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that wave functions in quantum mechanics should be normalized. Oh right, normalization means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. That makes sense because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

But wait, the question says that when they measured the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function is zero outside this interval. Hmm, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. I need to think about how this applies.

Wait, maybe the wave function given is only valid in the region x between 1 and 3. Because outside that, the wave function is zero. So the wave function is non-zero only from x=1 to x=3.

So the wave function is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i, but that's only for x between 1 and 3. Elsewhere, Ψ(x) is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is a complex function here, with a real part and an imaginary part. That's okay,
