Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they provided the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. My goal is to figure out what compound X was from the options given.

Wait, what's the reaction here? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used base, maybe something like DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene). It's often used in elimination or epoxidation reactions. Oh wait, but I think it's more commonly used as a base in elimination reactions, like deprotonations leading to alkenes or other structures. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in epoxidation? Or perhaps it's an acid scavenger in some other reaction.

Compound X is C11H12O. Let me check the options:

Option A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure-wise, that's an oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group attached at position 2, and the styryl being 4-methyl. So the styryl is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring with a methyl at the para position.

Option B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Hmm, that's an oxirane where the substituent is a propenyl group. The structure would be (1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl), so like a benzene ring attached to a CH2-C(=CH2) group or something? Wait, maybe it's (Ph)-C(CH2O)-CH2, but I'm a bit confused about the substitution.

Option C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. Wait, oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So positions 2 and 3 would be adjacent carbons in the epoxide. So the structure would have a methyl on one carbon and a styryl (vinyl benzene) on the adjacent carbon.

Option D) 2-styrylepoxide. That's an epoxide with the styryl group attached to carbon 2. So the structure would be a styryl group (vinyl benzene) connected to the epoxide ring at position 2.

But wait, what's the reaction doing? The product's NMR is given, but I'm trying to find compound X. Oh, right, the reaction is between compound X and this base. So perhaps compound X is being epoxidized?

Wait, no. Wait, if the product is the epoxide, then maybe the reaction was an epoxidation. But compound X would be the alkene that was epoxidized. Because when you react an alkene with a peracid, you get an epoxide. But wait, in this case, the reagent is a base. Hmm, maybe it's an elimination reaction instead.

Wait, but the product is an epoxide. Let me think again. Another possibility: if compound X is a diol, and under basic conditions, it could form an epoxide via elimination. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is ring-opening of an epoxide? But no, because then the structure would change more. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. But that would require an acidic condition, perhaps with water or another nucleophile. But since the solvent is nonpolar and the base is present, maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which is an epoxidation of allylic alcohols. But I think the Sharpless uses a different catalyst, like a titanium-based one, and an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, it's used in other epoxidations as a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxide formation via an elimination. For example, if compound X is a vicinal diol, and under basic conditions, it would lose water to form an epoxide.

Wait, but the product NMR shows a structure that looks like it has a benzene ring and some substituents. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has signals at Î´2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. These are likely methyl groups attached to something deshielded but not splitting. Maybe attached to an electronegative group or part of an aromatic ring. Or perhaps they're in a conjugated system.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). The pattern suggests some coupling in the aromatic ring. Maybe a para-substituted ring with substituents causing doublets.

The 13C NMR data: 21.3 (s, 1C), 28.4 (s, 1C), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait a second, 197.7 is a very high chemical shift. That's typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde. But wait, could it be an epoxide oxygen? No, epoxides are ethers and their carbons are around 50-70 ppm. Wait, 197 could be an ester or a ketone. But looking at the options, all the compounds are oxirane derivatives (epoxides), so maybe the 197 is another functional group.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, could that peak be from an adjacent oxygen, like an epoxide? No, epoxide carbons are lower in shift. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 197 is a carbonyl from an ester or amide. But looking at the formula for compound X, it's C11H12O. The product's formula would depend on what reaction occurred. If X is an alkene, and it's epoxidized, then the product would have an epoxide group, which adds O, so the formula would be C11H10O2? Wait, but the product's formula isn't given. Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR again: the two singlet methyl groups. Maybe they are attached to an aromatic ring, like para-methyl groups on a styryl system. Or perhaps they are attached to an epoxide ring.

Wait, let's consider the 13C NMR. There's a carbon at 197.7. That's high, so maybe it's a carbonyl, but epoxides don't have that. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or another ketone, but the product is an epoxide. Hmm, perhaps that's part of the structure.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows a singlet at 21.3 and 28.4. Those are likely methyl groups either attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like being in a symmetrical position or attached to an electronegative atom.

The aromatic carbons: 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s). So that's 6 aromatic carbons, but in the 1H NMR, there are 6 H's: 1H (d) + 2H (d) + 1H (d) + 2H (d) = 6 H. So it's a mono-substituted benzene? Or perhaps a para-substituted benzene with some substituents causing splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene, like a styrene. For example, a para-methyl styryl group. Let's think about the coupling in the 1H NMR.

The aromatic protons: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That seems like a pattern where there are two doublets of 2H each and two singlets, but wait, no, the integrals add up to 6H. Let's see:

- 6.75: 1H, d
- 7.08: 2H, d
- 7.68: 1H, d
- 7.71: 2H, d

Wait, that adds up to 6H. So perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with a substituent that causes each H to couple with adjacent Hs. Alternatively, it's a para-substituted benzene with a vinyl group, leading to a coupling pattern.

Wait, another angle: the product has an epoxide ring. Looking at the options, all of them are epoxides except maybe one. So the product is an epoxide resulting from X reacting with the base.

Wait, but in the product, the NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7. Hmm, that's a problem because epoxides don't have carbonyls. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the product is not an epoxide but something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. If compound X is an epoxide, and the base opens it, but why would that produce a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps compound X is a diene, and the base induces some reaction. Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Let me think about the product's structure. The 1H NMR indicates two methyl groups as singlets. So perhaps they are attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like two CH3 groups attached to adjacent carbons in an epoxide. Or perhaps they are attached to carbonyls or aromatic rings.

Looking at the 13C NMR again, the highest shift is 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone or ester group. But the starting material is C11H12O, and the reaction is with a base, perhaps deprotonating something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination leading to a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide with a carbonyl group. But how? Maybe the epoxide is part of a larger ring, like a cyclohexene oxide with substituents.

Wait, maybe the product has both an epoxide and a ketone. But given the starting material is C11H12O, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl and an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with some substituents that include a ketone. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, option D is 2-styrylepoxide. That would be an epoxide where one of the oxygen-connected carbons is attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the structure would be O-CR1-CH2-CH2-Ph, but more accurately, the epoxide would be between two carbons, with one of them connected to a vinyl benzene.

But the NMR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps another group is present.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dihydroxylation followed by elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination reaction, forming a double bond from a vicinal diol. But then, the product would be an alkene, not an epoxide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to look at the options and their structures.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is an epoxide with the styryl group attached to carbon 2. So the epoxide is between C2 and C3, with C2 connected to a styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2-O-? No, wait, the styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-O? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-. Wait, no, styryl is a vinyl benzene group. So the structure would be a three-membered ring (epoxide) with one of the carbons connected to a Ph-CH2 group? No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is a vinyl group attached to benzene. So styryl is Ph-CH=CH2? No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, styryl is a benzene ring attached to a vinyl group, like Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, I think styryl is Ph-CH=CH-, so the epoxide would have one of the oxygen-connected carbons attached to a vinyl benzene. So structure: the epoxide is between C1 and C2, with C2 attached to a CH2 group leading to the benzene ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a benzene ring. Let me think about the NMR.

In the 1H NMR, the two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each 3H. These could be two methyl groups attached to the same or adjacent carbons. For example, if the epoxide has two adjacent carbons each bearing a methyl group, that could explain the two singlets.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. They're both singlets, so no splitting, meaning they are attached to carbons that have no neighboring Hs (like a CH3 attached to an oxygen in an epoxide). So perhaps the epoxide has two adjacent carbons each with a methyl group.

Wait, but an epoxide is a three-membered ring, so each carbon is connected to two others. So if each of the two carbons in the epoxide has a methyl group, then the structure would be (CH3)2-O in a three-membered ring. But that would form an oxirane, a three-membered ether with two methyl groups on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the formula of compound X is C11H12O. Let's see, the product would have what formula? If the product is an epoxide, it adds an oxygen. So if X is C11H12O, and the product is an epoxide, then the product would have one more O, so C11H10O2.

But looking at the NMR data, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product doesn't have an extra oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, but that would require the formula to have more oxygens. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, going back to the options. Let's consider option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide where one of the carbons is connected to a propenyl group with a phenyl attached. The structure would be O-CR1-CR2, where R1 is part of the epoxide and R2 is the propenyl group.

Alternatively, option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has a methyl group on C2 and a styryl on C3.

Wait, but in an epoxide, the two carbons are connected through the oxygen. So if there's a methyl on C2 and a styryl on C3, then the adjacent carbon would have the styryl group. Let me see: perhaps the structure is O-C(CH3)-CH2-Ph-CH2-CH2? No, I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-C(CH3)-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe the styryl is directly attached to the epoxide ring.

Wait, perhaps the product's structure includes a benzene ring and a substituent that includes the epoxide. Let me think about the 1H NMR again. The aromatic protons would be from a benzene ring attached to the epoxide.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are a 1H doublet, 2H doublet, another 1H doublet, and 2H doublet. That suggests a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? Or perhaps a para-substituted benzene with some coupling.

Wait, another thought: the aromatic protons are split into two doublets of two protons each and two doublets of one proton each. That suggests perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring, leading to a pattern like two sets of doublets.

Wait, but if the benzene is para-substituted with a vinyl group, the coupling could result in the observed pattern. For example, the protons adjacent to the substituent would be split into doublets. Alternatively, perhaps there are two substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has four signals: 6.75 (d,1H), 7.08 (d,2H), 7.68 (d,1H), 7.71 (d,2H). Let's think about what pattern that could correspond to. Perhaps it's a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene? Or maybe a di-substituted benzene with substituents causing specific couplings.

Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that causes the coupling. Hmm, perhaps the structure is something like benzalacetophenone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the aromatic region is from a vinyl group attached to a benzene (styrene), which would have a trans coupling. Let's think about the coupling in styrene. The protons on the double bond would couple with each other and with adjacent protons on the benzene ring.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons don't seem to directly correspond to a simple styrene structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't directly on the benzene but part of a larger substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styryl-substituted epoxide, like option D. So the structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group attached to one of the epoxide carbons. Let's imagine that.

In such a structure, the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-... but no, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-. So the epoxide would be O-CR1-CR2, with R1 being connected to Ph-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a larger ring, like a cyclohexene oxide with substituents, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product must have a carbonyl group. That suggests that the product isn't just an epoxide but something else, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't epoxidation but an elimination to form a carbonyl. If compound X is a diol, under basic conditions, it could lose two water molecules to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure how that fits with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition followed by elimination, forming a carbonyl. But I'm not very confident about that.

Wait, let's think about the 13C NMR. There are two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 ppm. These are likely to be attached to an aromatic ring or to an oxygen, like in an epoxide.

The signal at 197.7 is a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. But how does that fit with the options, which are all epoxides?

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the initial reaction. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's commonly used in elimination reactions, such as in the formation of alkenes from alcohols or in the Hofmann elimination.

So, if compound X is an alcohol, the base could deprotonate it and cause elimination, forming an alkene. But the product's NMR doesn't show any signals indicative of an alkene (like a triplet around 5-6 ppm for the CH2=CH2 region), unless it's part of an aromatic system.

Wait, but the product's NMR doesn't show any such signals. So maybe the elimination isn't forming a separate alkene but is part of a larger structure, like an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, but the reagent is a base. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps compound X is an epoxide, and the base is causing some ring-opening with a nucleophile, but the solvent is nonpolar, so no obvious nucleophile is present.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the options and their possible NMR spectra.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure would be:

O
||
C1 - C2 (with C2 attached to a styryl group: Ph-CH=CH-)

Wait, no, because styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2- but that's not right. Styryl is the group Ph-CH=CH-. So the structure would be an epoxide where one of the oxygen-connected carbons is attached to a Ph-CH=CH- group.

So the structure would be: O-CR1-CR2, where R1 is CH2-Ph-CH=CH2? No, wait, R2 could be Ph-CH=CH-CH2-? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the styryl is directly attached to the epoxide ring, like O-C(PhCH2CH2)-CH2, but I'm not getting it right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-C(PhCH2CH2)-CH2, but that would require more carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the styryl is attached via a single bond. So the epoxide is O-C(PhCH2CH2)-CH2. But that's getting a bit complicated.

In any case, the NMR shows two methyl groups as singlets. If the structure is an epoxide with two methyl groups attached to the two epoxide carbons, then the 1H NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups.

So for option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure-wise, that would be an epoxide where the substituent is a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring at position 1. So the substituent is (1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl), meaning the structure is Ph-C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

Epoxide: O-CR1-CR2

R1 is connected to a CH2 group, and R2 is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a benzene ring. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-Oxirane. But that doesn't involve a double bond, so the NMR wouldn't have any carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I should consider the 13C NMR. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl, so maybe the product has an ester or ketone group. But all the options are epoxides, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but an ester. But the starting material is C11H12O, and the product after reaction with a base might lose a water or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's count the carbons in the product.

The product's 13C NMR has 9 signals, which suggests 9 unique carbons. Let's see:

- Two methyl groups: 21.3 and 28.4 (2 carbons)
- Aromatic carbons: 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C) â 6 carbons
- The rest: 141.5, 144.1, 197.7 â 3 carbons

Total: 2+6+3=11 carbons. So the product is C11, which matches compound X's formula. But compound X is C11H12O, and the product would have more oxygens if it's an epoxide. Hmm, perhaps the product is an epoxide, so formula would be C11H10O2. But the NMR doesn't show any signals that would be from an epoxide's oxygen, but wait, epoxide protons are usually around Î´3.5-4.5, but in the product's 1H NMR, I don't see any peaks in that region. So perhaps the product isn't an epoxide.

Wait, but the options are all epoxides. So I'm confused. Maybe the product isn't an epoxide but a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. Let me think: if compound X is an epoxide, reacting with a base could cause it to open. But under what conditions? Epoxides typically open under acidic or nucleophilic conditions. The given solvent is nonpolar, and the base is present, so perhaps it's a basic ring-opening, but without a nucleophile, maybe it abstracts a proton and causes some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination to form a double bond. But the product's NMR doesn't show any alkenes.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the coupling in the aromatic region. The 1H NMR shows 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d,2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d,2H). Let me think about a structure that would have this coupling.

Perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, causing the coupling pattern. Alternatively, it could be a meta-substituted benzene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the aromatic protons are part of a vinyl group attached to the benzene. For example, in a styrene structure, the protons on the double bond would couple with each other and with adjacent protons on the benzene. Let me think: in the case of trans-stilbene, the protons on the double bond are trans and would couple with each other, but in the case of a substituted benzene, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a double bond. Then, the aromatic protons would be in specific positions.

Alternatively, maybe the product has a di-substituted benzene with substituents causing the observed coupling.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the substitution pattern. The 1H NMR shows a 1H doublet, 2H doublet, 1H doublet, and 2H doublet. Let me imagine a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene, but that would give a more complex splitting pattern, I think.

Wait, another approach: think about the coupling constants. In the 1H NMR:

- 6.75 (d): probably coupling with one adjacent proton.
- 7.08 (d, 2H): each of these two protons is coupled with another proton.
- 7.68 (d): same as the first.
- 7.71 (d, 2H): same as the second.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para) with substituents that cause each H to have one neighbor. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, then each substituent would have two adjacent Hs. But that might lead to a different splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 1H NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region, each a doublet. That suggests that each proton is coupled to only one other proton. So perhaps the structure has a single substituent on the benzene, causing two sets of doublets.

Wait, but a single substituent on a benzene ring would cause two sets of doublets. For example, a para-substituted benzene would have two sets of doublets for the protons ortho to the substituent. Let me think: in para-xylene, the protons adjacent to the substituent are all equivalent, but in this case, the integrals are different. So perhaps it's not a simple para substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, leading to coupling between the vinyl protons and the aromatic protons. For example, in a styrene molecule, the vinyl protons would couple with each other and with the aromatic protons.

Wait, but the 1H NMR doesn't show any peaks around 5-6 ppm, which is typical for vinyl protons. So perhaps the vinyl protons are deshielded and appear downfield, but in this case, the aromatic region is upfield, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't a vinyl group but something else.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the 13C NMR again. The 141.5 and 144.1 ppm are likely carbons attached to oxygen, like carbons adjacent to the epoxide oxygen. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, another angle: the product's formula. The starting material is C11H12O. If the reaction adds an oxygen (like forming an epoxide), the product would be C11H10O2. But the NMR data shows 11 carbons, which matches the starting material. So perhaps the reaction doesn't add any carbons, meaning the product has the same number of carbons as the starting material.

Wait, but epoxidation would add an oxygen without changing the number of carbons. So if the starting material is an alkene, the product would have an epoxide and the same number of carbons.

So, the product's formula would be C11H10O2. But the product's 1H NMR indicates 10 H's in the aromatic region and 6 in the non-aromatic (the two methyls and maybe some others). Wait, let me count the integrals:

1H NMR:
- 2.28 (3H, s)
- 2.31 (3H, s)
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Total H: 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 H. But the starting material was C11H12O, which has 12 H. So perhaps the reaction doesn't change the number of H. So the product is C11H12O as well. But that doesn't make sense if it's an epoxide, which would have more O.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the number of H, but adds an O elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a rearrangement that doesn't change the number of H, such as an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming a double bond and losing a water, which would decrease the number of H. But in this case, the H count remains the same.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure would be an epoxide with a 4-methylstyryl group attached. The styryl is a vinyl benzene with a methyl in the para position. So the structure would be O-CR1-CR2, where R1 is connected to the styryl group.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would include those from the styryl group. Let's imagine the styryl is Ph-CH=CH-O-... Wait, no, the epoxide would be a three-membered ring. So the structure would be O-C(Ph-CH=CH2)-CH2-... Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, the styryl is attached to one of the epoxide's carbons, making the structure O-C(Ph-CH2-CH2-)-CH2-... No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the structure is O-C(Ph-CH=CH-)-CH2-... That would make the epoxide have one substituent as a vinyl benzene.

In such a structure, the aromatic protons would be from the styryl group, and the vinyl protons would be adjacent to the epoxide. So the 1H NMR would show signals for the vinyl protons as well, but in the product's NMR, there are no signals around 5-6 ppm, which is where vinyl protons usually appear.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl protons are deshielded and appear downfield, in the aromatic region. That's possible if they're conjugated with the epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for the methyl groups. If the epoxide has two adjacent methyl groups, that would explain the singlets. So the structure would have (CH3)2-O as part of the epoxide.

Wait, but an epoxide can't have two adjacent methyl groups because it's a three-membered ring. The two carbons in the ring would each have one substituent. So, perhaps each has a methyl group attached.

For example, the structure would be O-C(CH3)-CH2-... But that would require the CH2 to be connected to something else. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be O-CR1-CR2, with R1 being connected to a propenyl group leading to a benzene ring. The propenyl group is CH2-CH2-Ph, but that's not correct. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-Ph? No, that would be 3-phenylpropen-1-yl.

Alternatively, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-O... No, that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-Oxirane. But that doesn't involve any double bonds, so again, no vinyl protons.

Wait, maybe option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has a methyl group on C2 and a styryl group on C3. The structure would be O-C(CH3)-CH(Ph-CH=CH2). But that's a bit complicated. Let me think about the substituents.

In such a structure, the epoxide would have a methyl and a styryl group. The styryl group would have a benzene ring with a vinyl group. So the aromatic protons would come from the styryl's benzene ring. The 1H NMR would show signals for the aromatic protons, the vinyl protons, and the methyl groups.

But in the product's NMR, the aromatic region doesn't show any peaks around 5-6 ppm that would correspond to vinyl protons. So perhaps the vinyl protons are deshielded and appear in the aromatic region. Alternatively, maybe the product doesn't have any vinyl protons, which would mean the substituent isn't a vinyl group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think differently. The product has a carbonyl group, as indicated by the 13C NMR at 197.7. So perhaps the product is a ketone. But looking at the options, all the compounds are oxiranes (epoxides). So perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide and a ketone, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but an ester or ketone formed from the starting material. But the options don't suggest that.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition followed by an elimination. For example, compound X is an enol ether, and under basic conditions, it undergoes some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen rearrangement, but that typically involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. That could explain the presence of a carbonyl in the product.

Wait, the Claisen rearrangement converts an allyl vinyl ether into a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone. So if compound X is an allyl vinyl ether, the product would be a carbonyl compound.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the presence of a carbonyl at 197.7 supports this. So perhaps the product is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone.

But how does that fit with the options? The options are all oxiranes. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the base causes a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. But under what conditions would that happen? Acidic conditions typically open epoxides, not basic. Unless it's a specific type of base that abstracts a proton leading to ring opening.

But if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, causing the ring to open and form a carbonyl, that could explain the product having a carbonyl. For example, in a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide ring opens to form a carbonyl via a neighboring group participation. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group, the base could abstract a proton leading to ring opening and formation of a conjugated carbonyl.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the structure. If the product has a carbonyl group and is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone, then its structure would have a conjugated double bond next to the ketone.

So the structure could be something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CO-..., but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a styryl ketone, like Ph-CH=CH-CO-R.

But given the starting material is C11H12O, and the product has the same number of carbons, but with a carbonyl, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product is a carbonyl-containing compound. The 1H NMR doesn't show any aldehyde protons, so it's likely a ketone or ester.

But the options are all epoxides, so perhaps the product isn't an epoxide after all. Then, this approach isn't working, so perhaps I should try a different method.

Another approach: Look for the number of unique carbons in the product. The product's 13C NMR has 9 signals, which suggests 9 unique carbons. The starting material is C11H12O, so the product must have 11 carbons. So the product has 9 unique carbons, which may include some symmetry.

If the product has two methyl groups as singlets, perhaps they are identical, but in the product's NMR, they appear as two separate signals. No, because the chemical shifts are different (21.3 and 28.4). So they're two different methyl groups.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a trityl compound, like triphenylmethanol. But the 1H NMR doesn't show any OH signals, and the 13C NMR doesn't show a peak around 100 ppm for the OH-bearing carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzophenone derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzaldehyde. But again, I don't see any aldehyde signals in the 1H NMR.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The correct answer is among the options A to D. Let me think about each option's structure and expected NMR.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: an epoxide where one of the oxygen-connected carbons has a styryl group attached. So the structure would be O-CR1-CR2, with R1 being a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-).

In such a case, the aromatic protons would come from the benzene ring attached to the styryl group. The NMR would show signals for the aromatic ring, the vinyl protons, and the methyl groups. But in the product's NMR, there's no signal in the vinyl proton region (around 5-6 ppm). So perhaps the vinyl protons are deshielded and appear downfield, in the aromatic region.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR data is for the epoxide, which would have two adjacent carbons each bearing substituents.

Wait, let's imagine the structure of option D: O-C(Ph-CH=CH2)-CH2-... Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So the structure would be O-CR1-CR2, where R1 is connected to a styryl group.

The styryl group would contribute aromatic protons and possibly some vinyl protons. But in the product NMR, there are no peaks in the vinyl region, so perhaps the vinyl protons are part of the aromatic region.

Alternatively, perhaps the styryl group's double bond is conjugated with the epoxide, causing the vinyl protons to shift downfield into the aromatic region.

Let me consider the 1H NMR for option D. The aromatic region would include the protons from the benzene ring and possibly the vinyl protons.

If the styryl group is para-substituted, the aromatic protons would show as two doublets of two H each and two doublets of one H each, which matches the product's NMR. So perhaps option D is the correct answer.

But then, what about the two methyl singlets? Option D doesn't have any methyl groups in its structure. So that's a problem. The product's NMR shows two singlets for 3H each, which suggests two methyl groups.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the substituent is a 4-methylstyryl group. That would mean the styryl group has a methyl in the para position. So the structure would be O-CR1-CR2, where R1 is connected to a Ph-CH=CH2 group with a methyl in the para position.

In this case, the aromatic protons would include those from the para-methyl styryl group. The methyl group on the benzene would be a singlet in the 1H NMR. But wait, the product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups, which would suggest two different methyl groups. So option A has only one methyl group (the para substituent on the benzene), so it can't explain the two singlets. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure: O-CR1-CR2, with R1 connected to a propenyl group attached to a benzene. So the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane? No, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2=CH-CH2-Ph.

In such a structure, the propenyl group would have protons on the double bond. But the product's NMR doesn't show any peaks in the vinyl region, so this might not fit.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: O-C(CH3)-CH(Ph-CH=CH2). So the epoxide has a methyl group on one carbon and a styryl group on the adjacent carbon.

In this case, the aromatic protons would come from the styryl group's benzene. The structure would have a methyl group (the 2-methyl) as a singlet in the 1H NMR. But the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, so this doesn't fit. So option C has only one methyl group, which doesn't explain the two singlets.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: O-C(Ph-CH=CH2)-CH2-... Wait, that doesn't make sense. The epoxide would have two carbons connected to the oxygen. So the structure would be O-CR1-CR2, with R1 being connected to the styryl group.

In this case, R1 is Ph-CH=CH2 and R2 is perhaps a hydrogen or another substituent. But the product's NMR shows two methyl groups, which option D doesn't have. So option D is also unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the options wrong. Let me check option B again.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is (1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl), which is a propenyl group attached to a benzene at position 1. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane? No, it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, no. The substituent is (1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl), which is CH2=CH-CH2-Ph. So the structure would be:

O
||
C1 - C2

C1 is connected to the substituent CH2=CH-CH2-Ph. So the structure is O-CR1-CR2, where R1 is CH2=CH-CH2-Ph and R2 is H.

In such a case, the substituent would have a double bond, leading to vinyl protons. But the product's NMR doesn't show any peaks in the vinyl proton region, so this option might not fit.

Wait, but maybe the double bond is conjugated with the epoxide, causing the vinyl protons to appear in the aromatic region. That could explain why there are no peaks around 5-6 ppm.

In that case, the aromatic region would include the protons from the benzene ring and the vinyl protons. But the product's NMR has four doublets in the aromatic region, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent doesn't have any protons, but that's not the case here.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the 13C NMR again. The two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. Those are typically for CH3 groups attached to something electronegative, like oxygen or a carbonyl.

If the product has two methyl groups attached to the epoxide, then perhaps the structure is an epoxide with two adjacent methyl groups, like (CH3)2-O in a three-membered ring. But that would make the structure O-C(CH3)-CH2-, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option B has a substituent with a CH2 group leading to the benzene. So the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-Ph. So the structure would be O-CR1-CR2, with R1 being CH2=CH-CH2-Ph and R2 being H.

In such a case, the substituent would have a double bond, leading to vinyl protons. But their chemical shifts would typically be around 5-6 ppm, which isn't present in the product's NMR. So perhaps the product's NMR doesn't show these because they're integrated into the aromatic signals. Alternatively, maybe the substituent doesn't have any protons, which isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about option B's structure again. If the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Ph-CH2-CH=CH-Oxirane? No, that would be a different structure.

Alternatively, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH=CH2, attached to the epoxide. But then the structure would have a vinyl group, leading to vinyl protons.

I'm really stuck here. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the data.

The product's 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups, which suggests two different CH3 groups. The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with some coupling. The 13C NMR shows a carbonyl, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the product is an acetophenone derivative. For example, 4-methylacetophenone. But that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring. But again, not matching the options.

Wait, another thought: the product's formula is C11H12O. The starting material is also C11H12O. So the reaction doesn't change the number of carbons or hydrogens, only the functional groups. So perhaps the reaction is an isomerization, like moving a functional group.

But the options are all epoxides, which suggests that the reaction is an epoxidation. So the starting material must be an alkene that becomes an epoxide.

Wait, but how does that fit with the NMR data, which includes a carbonyl?

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is an allyl group attached to a carbonyl, and the reaction forms an epoxide adjacent to the carbonyl. Then, the product would have both a carbonyl and an epoxide.

But the options don't include such a structure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation of an allyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a conjugated epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an allyl ether, and the reaction forms an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to go with the option that best fits the NMR data.

The product's 1H NMR has two methyl singlets, which suggests two different CH3 groups. The aromatic region suggests a substituted benzene. Also, the presence of a carbonyl in the 13C NMR suggests a ketone or ester.

Looking at the options again, option B has a propenyl group attached to a benzene, which would have a double bond leading to vinyl protons. But the product's NMR doesn't show those, so perhaps that's not the case.

Option A has a 4-methylstyryl group, which would have a benzene ring with a methyl and a vinyl group. The substituent would be Ph-CH=CH2 with a methyl in the para position.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be from the benzene ring. The methyl group would be a singlet. But the product's NMR has two methyl singlets, so this doesn't fit.

Option C has a methyl and a styryl group on adjacent carbons in the epoxide. So the structure would be O-C(CH3)-CH(Ph-CH=CH2). The aromatic protons would come from the styryl group. But the product's NMR shows two methyl groups, so this might not fit.

Option D has a styryl group attached to the epoxide. But again, no methyl groups in the structure, so the two methyl singlets in the NMR can't be explained.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the starting material is an epoxide with substituents that, upon reaction, form a carbonyl and an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with two methyl groups attached to the epoxide carbons. So the structure would be (CH3)2-O in a three-membered ring. But that would require the substituents to be on adjacent carbons, which would give two singlets for the methyl groups.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match that description. Option B has a substituent with a propenyl group, which doesn't explain the methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which forms a ketone by inserting an oxygen adjacent to a carbonyl group. But that would change the number of carbons, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the data, the product has two methyl groups, a benzene ring, and a carbonyl group. The only option that includes a benzene ring and a carbonyl is none of them, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but a ketone. But the options are all epoxides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an epoxidation but a different type of reaction. Without more information, I'm not sure.

Given all this, I think the best fit is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct answer because it's the only one with a styryl group, which would explain the aromatic region. But the methyl groups are a problem.

Wait, maybe the two methyl groups are part of the substituent. For example, in option B, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-Ph, which doesn't have any methyl groups. So that doesn't explain the NMR.

In option C, the substituents are methyl and styryl, which would give one methyl group, but the product has two. So that doesn't fit.

Option A has a single methyl on the benzene, so that doesn't fit.

Option D has no methyl groups, so that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe I've miscounted the substituents. Let me think again.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for 3H each, so two different methyl groups. The 13C NMR has two separate methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4.

So perhaps the epoxide has two methyl groups attached to the two carbons in the ring. For example, O-C(CH3)-CH2-... But that would require the substituent to be a methyl and something else.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone group. Therefore, the reaction must have formed a ketone. The only way that fits is if the starting material was an epoxide that opened to form a ketone. But under what conditions would an epoxide open to form a ketone? Acidic conditions, perhaps, but the reagent is a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen rearrangement, which forms a ketone. Let me think about that.

The Claisen rearrangement converts an allyl vinyl ether to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So if compound X is an allyl vinyl ether, the product would be a carbonyl compound.

Assuming that's the case, the product would have a carbonyl group, which matches the 13C NMR.

So, the starting material X would be an allyl vinyl ether, and after the Claisen rearrangement, it becomes a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone.

But looking at the options, none of them are allyl vinyl ethers. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination forming a double bond and a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the 1H NMR showing two methyl groups, a benzene ring, and the 13C showing a carbonyl, I think the product is a ketone with a benzene ring and two methyl groups. But none of the options fit this directly.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves identifying compound X (C11H12O) based on the NMR data of the product after reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The reaction conditions suggest a base-mediated transformation, possibly involving elimination or rearrangement. The product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups (3H each), aromatic protons, and no signals in the typical vinyl proton region (5-6 ppm). The 13C NMR includes a carbonyl signal at 197.7 ppm, which is unusual for an epoxide but suggests a carbonyl-containing product.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
   This structure features an epoxide with a 4-methylstyryl group. The styryl group would contribute aromatic protons, but the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, which this structure cannot explain since it only has one methyl group on the benzene ring. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
   This structure includes an epoxide with a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring. The propenyl group would typically produce vinyl protons around 5-6 ppm, which are absent in the product's NMR. However, the aromatic region matches a substituted benzene, and the absence of vinyl protons could be due to conjugation shifting them downfield into the aromatic region. This option is plausible but not definitive.

3. **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
   This structure has an epoxide with a methyl group on one carbon and a styryl group on the adjacent carbon. The styryl group would contribute aromatic protons, but the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, which this structure cannot explain since it only has one methyl group. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
   This structure features an epoxide with a styryl group directly attached to one of the epoxide carbons. The styryl group would contribute aromatic protons, but this structure lacks any methyl groups, which contradicts the two methyl singlets in the product's NMR. Thus, this option is also unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The product's NMR data, including the two methyl singlets, aromatic protons, and the absence of vinyl protons, suggests a structure with a benzene ring and two methyl groups. None of the options perfectly match all the data, but **Option B** (2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane) aligns most closely with the aromatic region and the possibility of conjugation shifting vinyl protons into the aromatic region. While the absence of vinyl protons remains unexplained, this option is the best fit among those provided.

**Answer: B**
