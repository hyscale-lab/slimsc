Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I think red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a type of elimination or addition? Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is often used to deoxygenate things, like maybe removing an epoxide or something. Or wait, another thought: I remember that when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it can lead to the formation of an alcohol. Or wait, maybe it's related to the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, but wait, red phosphorus with HI is similar. Oh right! The Wurtz reaction is when you have two alkyl halides reacting with sodium metal to form a longer chain. But wait, that's not quite what's happening here. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's a substitution where a leaving group is replaced. Alternatively, if the compound has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might lead to its reduction.

So first, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's start with the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely O-H stretch. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid). Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is around the range for aromatic C=C stretches. The 1450 cm-1 could be from C-O stretching, maybe in an ester, or maybe from the aromatic ring's bending vibrations. So possible functional groups: a carbonyl, aromatic ring, and maybe an ester group.

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 1H. That's quite high, which makes me think of an -OH proton, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe a phenolic -OH? But phenols have protons around 5 ppm usually. Hmm, confusion here. Wait, another possibility: an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. So a singlet at 10.5 could be that. Or maybe an aldehyde, but in that case, I'm not sure why it's broad. Aldehydes are usually sharp singlets. Alternatively, maybe an enol proton?

Then, the other signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, like a para-disubstituted benzene. For example, if there are two substituents in para positions, each substituent has a hydrogen that's coupled to the other. So, maybe something like p-xylene? Or perhaps a substituted benzene with two identical groups in para positions.

Next, the NMR shows a triplet at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Wait, it's a multiplet for 1H. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let me think about these. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H is likely a methyl group attached to something that's split into a triplet. Wait, a triplet for a CH3 would come from being adjacent to a CH2 group. But wait, 0.9 ppm is low, so maybe it's a CH3 at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group. So, perhaps a CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, let me think again.

Let me try to piece this together. The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene. The substituents in the para positions: maybe one is an electron-withdrawing group, since there's a carbonyl in the molecule. Wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and another group, maybe a methyl or ethyl group. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely from a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2 or something. So maybe a butyl group? Let's think: for example, a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but the splitting would matter.

Looking at the
