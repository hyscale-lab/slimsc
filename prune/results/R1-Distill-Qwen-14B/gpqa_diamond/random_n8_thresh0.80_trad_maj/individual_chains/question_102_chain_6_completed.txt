Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up in the microscopy. Let me start by reading through the problem again to understand all the details.

So, the setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair was identified in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. The question is about a construct they made to study their interaction's developmental fate.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the ligand comes first, then the receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's constitutive. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to translation of the second gene without the need for another promoter. So the ligand is driven by CBA, and the receptor is downstream of the IRES, which probably uses the same mRNA as the ligand.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272. These stop cassettes are probably to prevent read-through from the first gene into the second. So when they're in place, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP. But if Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the two ORFs to be expressed together.

They made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, which are where the ligand and receptor are originally expressed.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They don't see a green signal, which is from eGFP. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, or the receptor-eGFP isn't being made correctly.

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells or not. If the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, autocrine, then the construct would express both. If they're paracrine (different cells), the expression might not be in the same cells. But since the construct is a bicistronic vector, it should express both proteins in the same cell if the stop cassettes are removed.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP is not properly trafficked, it might not be on the cell surface. But the question is about expression. They did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. So the proteins are being expressed and processed (maybe). But the eGFP fusion isn't showing up in the cells. Maybe the construct's expression isn't happening.

C) The enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is constitutive. The receptor is under IRES. So maybe the issue is that the CBA promoter isn't driving the receptor expression. But IRES usually allows for some level of translation without a strong promoter. Alternatively, if the enhancer is missing, both might not be expressed. But the Western blot would show whether the receptors are expressed. Since the question doesn't mention the blot results, but says that expression was tested. Wait, the question says after plasmid transfection to astrocyte culture, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they presumably checked that the construct works in vitro.

But in the mouse, they're using SOX10-Cre. Which means that Cre is expressed under the control of SOX10 in neural crest-derived cells. So the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor. If the eGFP isn't showing up, perhaps the eGFP isn't being properly expressed.

Wait, in the construct, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the construct would be receptor-eGFP. If the stop cassette is still in place, the receptor might not be expressed. But since they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should excise the lox2272 sites, the stop cassette should be removed. So the receptor should be expressed.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh! If the ORF of the receptor is not in frame with eGFP, then the fusion protein wouldn't be made. So the eGFP would either not be expressed, or if the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be properly translated.

Wait, but how is the construct designed? The receptor ORF is at the 3' end, and eGFP is fused at the C-terminus. So the structure would be receptor-eGFP as a single ORF, right? So if the stop cassette is in between, when it's removed, the receptor and eGFP are in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be correctly expressed. So in the mouse, the construct is in the genome as a single transcription unit. So if the IRES is functioning, the receptor would be expressed. But if the eGFP is not in frame, the fusion won't form.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they tested the expression. The question says that when they use the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, they see a signal proportional to actin. So the proteins are being expressed. But in the mouse model, after using Cre, the eGFP isn't showing up. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working properly. But IRES should allow for the receptor to be expressed from the same mRNA as the ligand.

Wait, but the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, so the same mRNA would have the ligand followed by the receptor. So the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But wait, the stop cassettes. The ligand ORF is upstream of the stop with loxP. So normally, the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP if the stops are removed by Cre.

If the Cre isn't working, the stops are still in place, so the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is not expressed because the stop is present. But in the mouse model, they are using SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to target neural crest cells. So in the mouse, the construct should have Cre excise the stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't showing up. So why is that?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the construct was made in a way that the receptor's C-terminus is fused to eGFP, but the reading frame is incorrect, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a functional tag. So the eGFP would either not be expressed, or the fusion protein would be truncated, so no proper eGFP.

But wait, why wouldn't it express at all? Because if the frame is wrong, the eGFP is part of a larger ORF, but the stop codon would be present elsewhere, so the eGFP might not even be made. Alternatively, the eGFP might be expressed as a separate ORF if the frame is correct.

Wait, but in the construct, the receptor ORF is followed by eGFP. So if the fusion is in frame, the receptor-eGFP is one protein. If not, then when the stop is removed, the receptor might be expressed, but the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to no eGFP.

But why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be made properly. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is still present. But the Cre is supposed to remove the stop cassette.

Wait, the stop cassette is lox2272. SOX10-Cre is a Cre recombinase that specifically recognizes loxP sites, or lox2272 as well? Cre typically recognizes loxP sites, but there are variants like lox2272 which are modified so that Cre can still cut them, but other recombinases can't. So if the vector uses lox2272 for one stop cassette and loxP for the other, that might be an issue.

Wait, the ligand has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in lox2272. So when SOX10-Cre is expressed, which recognizes loxP, it would only cut the loxP stops, right? So the ligand's stop would be removed, but the receptor's stop is in a lox2272 site, which Cre can't cut? Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a variant that Cre can still recognize. Because the lox2272 site is a mutated loxP site that is still cut by Cre but not FLP. So maybe in the construct, both stops are lox sites but different types. The ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. So when SOX10-Cre is active, it would remove the loxP stop (ligand side), but not the lox2272 stop (receptor side). So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, but the receptor would still have the stop, so it isn't expressed. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP isn't made, so no eGFP.

That would explain why the eGFP isn't observed. So the problem is that the lox2272 site isn't being cut by Cre, so the stop remains, and the receptor isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, none directly state that. Let me check the options again.

Option C says the enhancer for the expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which should be strong, and the receptor is under IRES. If SOX10-Cre is active, the stops would be removed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working. IRES elements can be tissue-specific, maybe the IRES used here doesn't function in the cells being looked at, so the receptor isn't expressed. But in that case, the Western blot should have shown that.

Wait, the problem states that after plasmid transfection into primary astrocytes, they used the antibodies on Western blot. So the plasmid construct works in vitro, meaning that the IRES does function in those cells. Therefore, the problem is not with the IRES.

So perhaps the issue is that the Cre isn't removing both stops. Let me think about the vector again. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette; the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. SOX10-Cre is likely using Cre, which can cut loxP but not lox2272? Or can it? Wait, I think that lox2272 is a modified site that still allows Cre to cut. So in that case, the Cre would remove both stops.

Wait, I'm not quite sure about that. I remember that lox2272 is a variant that is cut by Cre but not FLP. So if the construct has lox2272, Cre should still cut it. So the problem might be something else.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up such that both stops are present, but the lox sites are in the opposite orientation. But no, the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, but the Cre is only hemizygous. SOX10-Cre is on one chromosome. But it's active, so that shouldn't matter.

Wait, another angle: the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes, but the mouse model is being used. Maybe in the mouse, the expression is not happening because the enhancer is missing. But the CBA promoter is strong, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is wrong for the eGFP. So even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in frame, so it isn't expressed.

Wait, the vector is designed as ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP). If the stop is in the correct place, and the frame is right, then when Cre is active, both fusions should be expressed. But if the frame is wrong for the receptor-eGFP, the eGFP won't be expressed. That would explain why the eGFP isn't fluorescing.

So looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't be made correctly, so no fluorescence.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly translated because of a frameshift. So the fusion protein would be made, but the eGFP part is not functional.

So why would the eGFP not be in frame? Maybe during cloning, the insertion of eGFP wasn't done correctly. So the C-terminus of the receptor is fused to eGFP, but the reading frame is off.

Wait, but the question states that the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells, and the construct should allow their expression. So the problem is in the vector design.

So the answer is probably D. Because if the eGFP is out of frame, it's not expressed.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to co-express a ligand and receptor in neural crest cells. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The construct includes stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) that are removed by Cre recombinase to allow expression of the fusion proteins. The mouse model is crossed with SOX10-Cre mice to activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells, but no green signal from eGFP is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express both proteins in the same cell, and the absence of eGFP fluorescence is unlikely due to their relationship being paracrine. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, but the question states that the proteins were tested via Western blot, which showed signals proportional to actin loading. This indicates that the proteins are being expressed and processed, making this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive and strong, and the receptor is downstream of an IRES element, which allows translation without a promoter. The Western blot results confirm that the construct works in vitro, and the issue is more likely related to the design or expression of the eGFP fusion, not the absence of an enhancer. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly as a fusion protein. This would result in no fluorescence, even if the stop cassette is removed by Cre. The construct design suggests that the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, but if the frame is incorrect, the eGFP would not be properly translated. This explanation aligns with the observed lack of fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of eGFP fluorescence is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of the eGFP fusion protein.
