Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their interaction's developmental fate. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that someone created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, and it's fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. 

Wait, I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, often used for high expression. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so that the second gene can be translated without the need for a second promoter. So, the construct probably allows for the ligand and receptor to be expressed together.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP have a stop cassette with lox2272. Oh, right, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants. Cre recombinase can recognize loxP sites and excise the DNA between them. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP. But when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stops, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

So, in the initial experiment, the person transfected primary astrocyte culture with the plasmid and tested expression using Western blot. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The total protein loading was checked with actin. But when they bred the mouse homozygous for the construct on a wild-type background and crossed them to SOX10-Cre heterozygous mice... Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So, Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

The offspring should have the Cre recombinase active in neural crest cells. So, in those cells, the lox sites should be excised, the stop cassettes removed, allowing expression of mCherry (from ligand) and eGFP (from receptor). When they looked under the confocal, they didn't see a green signal. So, the eGFP isn't being expressed.

What could be the reason for no green signal? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but in this case, the construct is for co-expression. I'm not sure how that relates to the expression in the same cell. Maybe it's about whether the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell. But the vector is bicistronic, so both should be expressed in the same cell upon Cre activity. So perhaps if they're paracrine, the ligand is secreted and acts on nearby cells' receptors. But the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't expressed, maybe the receptor isn't correctly trafficked. But the Western blot would have shown the receptor's presence if it's just stuck in Golgi, unless the antibody couldn't detect it. Alternatively, perhaps the fusion is causing issues. But the question states that in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, if the construct was expressed, the Western would pick up the proteins. So maybe the proteins are expressed but not fluorescent. Wait, in the mouse model, the Cre would have activated the construct, so the ligand and receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP would be a fusion with the receptor. If the eGFP is not expressed, perhaps the construct isn't being recombined correctly.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor has an IRES, so it's expressed from the same transcript but translated via IRES. So, perhaps without an enhancer, the expression isn't happening. But the CBA promoter is supposed to be strong enough. Unless the mouse construct is missing an enhancer. But in the question, the vector was tested in primary astrocytes with Western blotâ€”so it did express. So in the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening in the right tissues, but the question is about why there's no eGFP signal.

Wait, but the mouse is crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest cells. So the construct should be activated only in those cells. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the CBA promoter isn't active in those cells. But
