Okay, so I have this question about stars and their compositions, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Let me first read the question carefully.

So, the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun. But wait, the question says to consider the elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE. The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. We also have the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

The task is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, so I think this means (n_Si,Star1 / n_Si,Star2) ?

Wait, no, wait. The ratio is Star_1's silicon to Star_2's silicon. So [Si/Star1] / [Si/Star2]?

Wait, no, the ratio is (n_Si,1)/(n_Si,2). So I need to find each star's silicon abundance relative to the Sun, and then take the ratio.

Wait, but wait, the way the question is phrased: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photos
