Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get a bit tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR showing a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm. Let me think about what that means.

Wait, in NMR, the number of hydrogens corresponds to the area under the peak. So 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. The triplet is probably from a CH2 group next to another CH2, maybe like (CH2CH2) something. Wait, 6H in a triplet suggests maybe two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. Because each CH3 would split into a triplet if next to a CH2. Let's think: if the triplet is from two CH3 groups next to a CH2, then the 6H comes from two CH3 (each has 3H, so 2×3=6H). And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H is probably a CH2CH2 group, like a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So maybe something like (CH2CH2CH2) but wait, the quartet for 4H—wait, a quartet would come from a CH2 next to a CH3. Because a quartet means n+1, where n is the neighboring protons. So a quartet would come from a CH2 where each H is next to another group with 3 H. So maybe like a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, let me think again. For a quartet (n=3, so neighboring group has 3H), which would be a CH2 next to a CH3. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me do this properly.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the quartet is a CH2 group next to a CH2 that's next to a CH3. Wait, let me think about the integration: 6H as triplet, 4H as quartet. So perhaps the structure is a di-substituted ethyl group. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something else. For example, maybe ethyl groups attached to a central atom, like O or something else. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane with substituents.

Wait, another approach: the triplet (6H) is probably two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 would split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group. So the triplet would be from two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. So that would be (CH2CH3)2. Wait, but that would be a triplet for each CH3, but since they're equivalent, it's a single triplet integrating to 6H. Then the quartet is 4H—so that's a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, perhaps with more substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't fit the NMR. Let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests
