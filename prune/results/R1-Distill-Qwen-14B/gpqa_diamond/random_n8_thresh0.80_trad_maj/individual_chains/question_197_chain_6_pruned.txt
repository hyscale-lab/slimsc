Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about identifying the final product after a reaction. So, the compound X undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Wait, right! They're used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or wait, no, maybe that's different. Oh wait, another possibility is that they're used in the hydrolysis of esters, but perhaps more commonly, they're part of the conditions for the Hunsdiecker reaction or maybe for the formation of alkenes from alkyl halides? Hmm, maybe I should think about the reagents again.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. When a nitrile reacts with H-I and red phosphorus, it typically converts the nitrile into an amine. Oh right, the process is called the Stephen reduction but wait, no, that's with H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, the reaction of nitriles with HX (like HI) and red phosphorus leads to the formation of a primary amine. So, if compound X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus might lead to a different reaction. For example, esters can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids or alcohols, but I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Alternatively, maybe it’s a different reaction. Oh, wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides. Acid chlorides can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using water, but if you have red phosphorus, maybe it's a different pathway.

But let me try to figure out what compound X is first, based on the spectral data given.

Looking at the IR data: strong peaks between 3400-2500 cm-1, which suggests the presence of either O-H or N-H groups. Also, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might correspond to aromatic C=C stretching, so there's likely an aromatic ring in the molecule.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid, but that’s usually a broad peak but maybe not as downfield as 10.5. Or maybe an enol proton? Hmm. Wait, another possibility is that it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe an enol with exchange broadening.

Wait, another thought: 10.5 ppm could also be an aromatic proton if it's a para-substituted ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups. But usually, aromatic protons are around 7-8.5 ppm. So 10.5 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let me think. So, if there's an aldehyde, the IR would show a peak around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretches), but looking at the IR data, the region given is 3400–2500, which includes the O-H or N-H stretches. Maybe the aldehyde is present but the IR doesn't show the aldehyde C-H. Alternatively, perhaps the IR peaks don't include the aldehyde because they're at lower wavenumbers. Wait, the IR peaks given are 3400–2500 (broad, possibly O-H), 1720 (carbonyl), and 1610 and 1450 (aromatic C=C).

Wait, but if the aldehyde is present, the IR should have a peak around 2800 for the C-H stretch. But the IR data in the question doesn't specify anything in that region except the 3400-2500, which is a broad area. Could it be that the aldehyde protons are in that region, or maybe they're not showing up in the given data? Hmm.

Looking further at the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This could be two aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene, as two doublets. If it's para-substituted, then the two protons would be equivalent and give a doublet each, with the same coupling. 

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another two protons, perhaps on the benzene ring as well, but maybe in the ortho positions or something else. Wait, if the aromatic ring has two substituents, maybe para to each other, then each proton on the ring would be in a certain environment. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent on the benzene that's causing this splitting. Alternatively, the two doublets could be from a di-substituted benzene, perhaps two substituents in the para position, and the protons are in the para and ortho positions.

Wait, let's think. If the benzene ring is para-substituted, each of the two protons ortho to the substituent would be equivalent, and the two meta would be equivalent. Wait, no, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. Then the protons adjacent would each have a certain coupling. Let me imagine a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. No, perhaps it's a monosubstituted benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted in the para position.

Wait, perhaps the NMR data indicates that there are four aromatic protons, which would suggest a disubstituted benzene. Because if it's a monosubstituted benzene, there would be five protons, perhaps as two doublets and a triplet or something. Alternatively, if it's a disubstituted benzene in the para position, then the ring would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. So, for example, two protons in the ortho position and two in the meta, but no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent at the para position, leading to two doublets. Hmm, perhaps it's a substituent that causes the ring to have two sets of two protons each.

Alternatively, considering the splitting, perhaps the substituents are such that the aromatic ring has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in a position that causes the ring protons to split into two doublets.

So, perhaps the molecule is an aromatic aldehyde with some substituents. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a side chain attached to the benzene ring.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to one proton. This could be a CH group attached to something else. Maybe a CH next to an oxygen or nitrogen, or perhaps a CH in a branched chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, integrating to two protons. Perhaps this is a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or another functional group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to three protons. This suggests a methyl group attached to a chiral center or a group that causes splitting. Maybe a CH(CH3) group or something like that.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to three protons. This is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, such as an ethyl group. So, a t (triplet) at 0.9 ppm is characteristic of a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents. Let's try to sketch a possible structure.

The benzene ring has two substituents. From the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. Let's say that the substituents are at para positions. For example, one substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), and the other substituent is a chain leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If the molecule has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an aldehyde and a ketone or another carbonyl group. But wait, an aldehyde has a carbonyl at around 1700 cm-1, but maybe the 1720 is a ketone or an ester. Wait, 1720 is more typical for an ester or a ketone. Wait, no, an aldehyde's C=O is around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H, which isn't in the IR data given. Hmm, maybe the IR data doesn't show the aldehyde's C-H stretches, or perhaps I'm wrong about the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet. Let's think about possible groups that have a proton around there. Aldehydes are around 9-10, but maybe an enolic proton could be higher. Alternatively, a phenolic OH would be around 5-10 ppm, but the IR peak at 3400-2500 suggests O-H or N-H. So if there's an O-H, that would show up in that region. But the 10.5 ppm proton is a singlet, so perhaps it's a proton not part of a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

But wait, if the compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's an nitrile. Because in the reaction conditions, nitriles are often hydrolyzed. So if X is a nitrile, then after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would become an amine.

But let's get back to the NMR. Let's suppose that X has a benzene ring with substituents and a side chain that leads to a nitrile group.

Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So if X is a nitrile, that would have a C≡N group, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Unless the carbonyl is from another group.

Wait, maybe X is an ester. Because esters have carbonyls. So, if X is an ester, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it undergoes some reaction. But I'm not exactly sure what the reaction would be. Alternatively, maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a nitrile group somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoyl chloride, but that might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, another thought: The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps there's an ethyl group attached to something else. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, like maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH adjacent to that.

Wait, putting it together: perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a chain like CH2-C(O)-something. Let me think.

Alternatively, considering the 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), that could be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. So, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CO-R, where R is another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic protons are two doublets: 8.0 ppm (2H, d) and 7.2 ppm (2H, d). That could suggest a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1, but that's the same as para. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, substituents at para positions would cause the neighboring protons to have specific coupling. Hmm, perhaps it's a 4-substituted benzaldehyde.

Wait, maybe the structure is p-methylbenzaldehyde with some substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a side chain that has a carbonyl group, like an acetophenone derivative.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent at the para position which is an ethyl group, and another substituent which is a carbonyl-containing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a chain leading to an ethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-(propanoyl)benzaldehyde or something similar.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The 10.5 ppm proton is probably an aldehyde, so the structure must have a -CHO group. Then, looking at the rest of the NMR:

The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) could be the aromatic protons. If the benzene ring has a substituent at the para position, then the protons adjacent to substituents would show as doublets.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CO-something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group leading to a carbonyl. Let me think.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carb
