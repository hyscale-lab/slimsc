Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions.

Wait, wait. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, maybe I misread that. Let me think. Oh, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d could be a typo. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 2-bromobenzene-1-d? No, wait, the way it's written, I think it's 1-bromo substituted on benzene with another substituent in the 2 position. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, where d is another substituent, like a methyl group or something. Maybe the 'd' stands for another substituent like a methyl? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's actually 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, a.k.a. bromotoluene.

Wait, but regardless, the key here is the structure
