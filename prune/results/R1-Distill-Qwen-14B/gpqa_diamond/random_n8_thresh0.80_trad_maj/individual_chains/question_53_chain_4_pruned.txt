Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. The 1H NMR has six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one as a doublet and one as a doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. No signals for CH2 groups.

Hmm, so the compound has an aromatic ring. Di-substituted means two substituents attached. The ring is six-membered, so likely benzene or a substituted benzene. The ester group suggests an -O-CO-O-R or maybe an -O-CO-OR structure? Wait, no, esters are usually R-O-CO-R. So maybe it's an aryl ester or an alkyl ester attached to the ring.

Looking at the NMR data: six signals, which probably corresponds to different types of protons. Let's list what they are.

Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern matters. If it's para, there are two equivalent H's in each ortho position, but wait, if it's para, the substituents are opposite, so the ring would have two sets of aromatic Hs, each as doublets maybe. Or if it's meta, perhaps more complex splitting. Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic H, which suggests two distinct sets. So maybe each substituent is in a position that causes the ring Hs to split into two groups. Like, maybe each substituent is in a position such that the ring has two types of Hs.

Vinyl H: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups typically have adjacent Hs, so maybe a double bond adjacent to something else. The doublet could be from a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester. Wait, the ester group would have an O-CO-O-R structure. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached. Alternatively, maybe it's a methacrylate or something similar.

The methyl groups: two signals. So two different -CH3 groups. Could these be from two different substituents? For example, if the ring has two ester groups, maybe each has a different R group. Or maybe one substituent is a methyl ester and another is something else with a methyl.

Wait, but the IR shows ester groups, so there's an ester. So the molecule might have an ester group attached as a substituent to the benzene ring. For example, an O-CO-O-R group or an R-O-CO- group. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent like an acetyloxy group (OAc) attached to the ring.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the aromatic ring has two ester substituents, each would probably contribute to the NMR. But wait, if it's a di-substituted benzene with two ester groups, perhaps each ester is a different group, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and another is something else.

Wait, but the NMR has two methyl groups. So maybe each methyl is attached to an oxygen, but more likely, perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester and another is a vinyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that one substituent is a methoxy ester and another is a methyl group. But that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, let me think about the vinyl Hs. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, while a doublet of quartets implies coupling with two sets. Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is adjacent to another group, like an ester. For example, an allyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like an acrylate group. So, something like CH2
