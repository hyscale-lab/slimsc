Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about the uncertainty in the P_z operator. I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the standard deviation of an observable in a given state. So the question is asking for ΔP_z, the uncertainty in P_z when the system is in a specific state.

Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. They also give the explicit form of the state as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So this is the state vector.

Wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the state is expressed in the P_z basis. To find the uncertainty in P_z, I think I need to compute the expectation value of P_z squared and then take the square root of (⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ψ† O ψ, where O is the operator's matrix, and ψ is the state vector. But since the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, and the state is given in that basis, the expectation value might be straightforward.

So let me write down the state ψ as a column vector: ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Now, the operator P_z has a matrix given. Let me copy that. The P_z matrix is:

Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, but wait. In quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator in a state ψ is given by ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Let me compute ⟨P_z⟩ first. The state is a column vector [a, b, c]^T, so ψ† is [a*, b*, c*]. But looking at the given state, all the components are real, so a*, etc., are just the same as a, b, c.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Let's compute each term:

a is -1/2, so a * (P_z's a) is (-1/2) * ħ. Similarly, the second component is 1/√2, multiplied by 0 (since P_z's middle element is 0), and the third component is (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (1/2) ħ.

Adding them up: (-1/2)ħ + 0 + (1/2)ħ = 0. Hmm, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element, so the matrix becomes [ ħ², 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, ħ² ].

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, compute each term:

a^2 * ħ² + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * ħ².

So a is -1/2, a² is (1/4) ħ². c is -1/2, c² is (1/4) ħ². b is 1/√2, so b² is (1/2) * 0 (because middle element of P_z squared is 0), so that term is zero.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, so ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ². And ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so (ΔP_z)^2 = ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = 1/2 ħ². So ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). That seems to fit. But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the state is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So when you compute ψ† P_z ψ, each component a, b, c is multiplied by P_z's diagonal entries.

So a is -1/2, times ħ: (-1/2) * ħ = -ħ/2.

c is -1/2, times (-ħ) is (1/2) ħ.

Adding the two: - ħ/2 + ħ/2 = 0. Hmm, that checks out.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, let's compute it again:

Each term is a² * (ħ)^2, b² * 0, c² * (ħ)^2.

Wait, a is (-1/2): a² is 1/4. So (1/4) * ħ².

c is (-1/2): c² is 1/4, so (1/4) * ħ².

b is 1/sqrt(2): b² is 1/2, multiplied by zero, so that term is zero.

So (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2. So (1/2) ħ². So yes, correct.

So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The state is given as the eigenvector of P_x, but we're expressing it in the P_z basis. So the state is already in the correct basis for P_z, so we don't need to change basis. So the calculations I did are correct as is.

Yes, I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix representation of $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi.
\]

Since the basis is the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the computation simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix representation of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 (0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
