Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics; we need to use special relativity formulas.

Alright, let's break this down. The question gives the masses as 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy. 

Wait, wait. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, actually, I think the formula is for the relative velocity when one observer is moving at speed u and another at speed v relative to the same frame. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v (both in the same direction), the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Or wait, is it (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²))? Wait, no, the formula for the velocity of object A as seen from B's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Since both are in the same direction, u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So substituting, (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) 

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So (0.1c)/0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. That's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. But wait, I need to compute the total energy for both, so add their energies. 

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me calculate for
