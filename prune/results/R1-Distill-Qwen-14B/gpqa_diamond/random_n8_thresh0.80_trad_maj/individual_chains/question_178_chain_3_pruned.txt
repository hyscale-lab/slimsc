Okay, so I have this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem gives the Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term's dimension must be 4 in four spacetime dimensions.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields involved. Fermion fields ψ typically have a mass dimension of 3/2. The electromagnetic field tensor F^{μν} is a field strength tensor, which has a mass dimension of 2. 

Wait, let me think again. The field strength tensor F is derived from the vector potential A, which has dimension 1. The field tensor F is the derivative of A, so each derivative adds dimension 1. So F has dimension 2, yes. 

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ doesn't contribute to the mass dimension. So the structure of the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F.

So the term is κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F. Let's compute the dimensions.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. F has dimension 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) F is 3 + 2 =5. 

So the whole term is κ multiplied by something with dimension 5. The term must have dimension 4 because that's the requirement for the Lagrangian. So the dimension of κ times 5 must equal 4. So [κ]_M = 4 -5 = -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Next, determining if the theory is renormalizable. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension ≤4. But wait, wait. Another way to think is about the coupling constant's dimension. If the coupling has positive mass dimension, like dimension d>0, then the interaction term would have dimension 4 -d. So for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must be ≤4, but wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the term is part of the Lagrangian, so each term must have mass dimension 4. The coupling constant's dimension is determined by balancing the term. If the coupling's dimension is negative, that's okay, but for renormalizability, the coupling must have a dimension that allows the theory to be predictive at all energy scales. 

Wait no, I think the key is that each term's dimension must be exactly 4, but for renormalizability, the coupling constants must have a mass dimension ≤4. Wait, I'm getting a bit muddled. Let me get this straight.

In general, for a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥0. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, then as the energy scale increases (i.e., when you go to higher energies), the coupling becomes stronger, leading to a Landau pole and making the theory not predictive
