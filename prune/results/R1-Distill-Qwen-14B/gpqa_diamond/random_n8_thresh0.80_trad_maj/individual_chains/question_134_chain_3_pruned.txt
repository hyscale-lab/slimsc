Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of enthalpy calculations. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, okay, I remember that neutralization reactions generally involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually exothermic, which is why the options are negative values.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the specifics. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base. But here, there are three solutions involved, so I need to figure out how they all react together.

First, I'll list out the given data. The volumes and concentrations of each solution:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

I need to find out how much acid and base are present and then determine the limiting reagent because the neutralization will depend on which one runs out first.

Let me calculate the moles for each acid and base.

Starting with HCl. The formula is HCl, so each mole provides one H+ ion. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L) = 0.1 moles HCl. That gives 0.1 moles H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and dissociates completely. The formula is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole gives 2 moles of H+. The moles here are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. So that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+ from H2SO4.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now for the base, Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base as well. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 OH- ions. The moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1. So I need to see if the H+ and OH- moles balance or which is in excess.

H+ total is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and some H+ will remain unreacted.

But wait, when mixing these solutions, will the H+ come from both HCl and H2SO4? Yes. So the total H+ is 0.28. But OH- is 0.2. So the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait another thing. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole gives 2 H+. So when calculating moles of H+, it's correct to multiply by 2.

So, the neutralization reaction will use up 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

But wait, the question is about enthalpy of neutralization. I think the standard value is for one mole of H+ and one mole of OH- reacting. So the enthalpy change for the reaction is ΔH = -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized, if I recall correctly. Wait, wait, no. Actually, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of acid reacting, but wait, no, wait. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base. So for a strong
