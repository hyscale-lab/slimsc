Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the problem says: when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases. The general reaction is acid + base → salt + water, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic, hence the negative sign.

But wait, there are three solutions here. So first, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base each solution contributes and whether they neutralize each other.

Let me list out what each solution is:

1. HCl is a strong acid. It dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.
2. H2SO4 is a strong acid too. It's diprotic, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions.
3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions.

So the total H+ from the acids and the total OH- from the base will determine how much neutralization occurs.

Let me calculate the moles of each.

First, HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So the OH- is 0.2 moles. The H+ is 0.28 moles. So OH- is less than H+. That means the OH- will be neutralized, and there will be excess H+.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Because when OH- neutralizes H+, the H+ will be reduced by the amount of OH-.

So the neutralization equation is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases energy (exothermic, so negative enthalpy).

The moles of H+ available are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+. So the total moles of H+ that will react is 0.2. The remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

Wait, but when considering the reaction, the amount of H+ that actually reacts is determined by the limiting reagent. In this case, OH- is the limiting reactant because there's more H+ than OH-.

So the neutralization reaction's stoichiometry is 1:1 between H+ and OH-.

So the moles of H+ reacting is equal to moles of OH- = 0.2.

Each mole of H+ reacting with OH- produces one mole of water, releasing enthalpy. I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact value.

Wait, wait. I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), since each H+ is neutralized by an OH- to form water.

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in this case, since we're considering neutralization, the two H+ ions would each react with OH-.

Wait, but in the neutralization reaction for H2SO4, the first H+ is more acidic and would react first, but in this case, since we have a limited amount of OH- (0.2 moles), perhaps only part of the H2SO4's H+ is neutralized.

Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ ions dissociate. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+. But when considering neutralization, each H+ needs an OH-.

So let me think: the total H+ available is 0.28 moles. The OH-
