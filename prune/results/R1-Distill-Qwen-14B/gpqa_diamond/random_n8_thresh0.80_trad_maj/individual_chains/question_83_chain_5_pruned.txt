Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, right. I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH changes in certain ways. At the equivalence point, for a weak acid like acetic acid and a strong base like NaOH, the solution will be the sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the pH should be basic because the conjugate base will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

Wait, but before that, let's handle the initial dilution. The acetic acid solution is being diluted with equal volume of water. So the concentration will be halved. Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant, right? Oh, wait, no. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and 20 cm³ of water is added, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is reached when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me think about the moles.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid, so 0.001 mol.

But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added. But the question says 25% titration. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. So at 25% titration, 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added.

Wait, no. Wait, the 25% is based on the equivalence point volume, which is 10 mL. So yes, 2.5 mL added. So, the moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, 2.5 mL is 0.0025 L. So 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since acetic acid is the weak acid, each mole of NaOH will react with a mole of acetic acid to form a mole of acetate ion and water.

So, let's model the situation at 25% titration.

Initially, the solution has 0.001 mol of CH3COOH (acetic acid) and 0.00025 mol of NaOH is added. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react completely with acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So, moles after reaction: CH3COOH will have 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol remaining. And the moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed will be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume is original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ added, so 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since CH3COOH is a weak acid and CH3COO^- is its conjugate base, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. The Ka given is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, let me calculate pKa. Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ) ).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) which is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Wait, that's about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and at equivalence point 8.52. But wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

The moles of sodium acetate at equivalence are 0.001 mol (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL (from the diluted solution) plus 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Since Kb is very small, the hydrolysis is minimal, and we can approximate using the formula:

[OH^-] ≈ sqrt( Kb * C ), where C is the concentration of acetate.

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486. Wait, 3.29e-6 is 3.29 x10^-6. pOH is around 5.48.

So pH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is 8.52.

Looking back, the options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57;6.92

So option A matches 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations, especially the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Wait, when calculating the concentrations, I considered the total volume as 42.5 mL (40+2.5). Is that correct? Yes, because when you add 2.5 mL of NaOH to 40 mL of solution, the total volume is 42.5 mL.

So, [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425, which is approximately 0.005882 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

The ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson equation: 4.733 + log(0.333) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26.

At equivalence point, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M. The Kb is Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The OH^- concentration is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02 ) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.289e-6.

pOH is -log(3.289e-6) ≈ 5.485.

pH is 14 - 5.485 = 8.515, which rounds to 8.52.

That matches option A.

Wait, but let me think about the equivalence point again. When we have a solution of sodium acetate, the pH depends on the hydrolysis of acetate ions. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution should be basic. So the pH should be above 7, which 8.52 is.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when you
