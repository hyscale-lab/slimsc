Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. The problem gives some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star / (n_X / n_Y)_sun ). So a positive value means more X relative to Y than the Sun.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

Hmm, the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Let me parse that. So for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5), nMg/nH_sun = 10^-5.

But wait, in the question, the given values are [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So for Star_1, the ratio [Fe/H] is log10( (Fe/H)_1 / (Fe/H)_sun ) = 0. So (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So Fe abundance in Star_1 is same as Sun relative to H.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun. So Mg in Star_2 is same as Sun relative to H.

Wait, but the other abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So that's log10( (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun )=0.3. Since (Fe/H)_1 is same as Sun, perhaps the ratio is same? Or maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Let me think about Star_1 first. Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 =0, which is the same as the Sun, so (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So [Fe/H] is 0.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^(0.3) times (Si/Fe)_sun.

Because [X/Y] = log( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ) = 0.3. So (X/Y)_star = 10^0.3 * (X/Y)_sun.

So for Star_1, (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

What's (Si/Fe)_sun? The Sun's value is given, but not directly. Wait, the Sun's composition is given for Fe and Mg, but not Si. Hmm. Maybe I can express Si in terms of Fe and Mg.

Wait, perhaps I should take it step by step.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

But what is (Si/Fe)_sun? Well, for the Sun, it's (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. But we
