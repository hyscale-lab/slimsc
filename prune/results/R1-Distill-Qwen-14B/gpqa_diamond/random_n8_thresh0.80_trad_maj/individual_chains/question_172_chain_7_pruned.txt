Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me think through this.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations between two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k times temperature). Oh right, the equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this case, the energy difference is E = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, and the problem says the atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as those in star 2. Let me parse that. So, the population of the higher energy level in star 1 is twice that in star 2. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, maybe the number of atoms in that excited state is double in star_1. Or perhaps the excitation is higher, implying a higher energy level?

Wait, I think the setup is that for each star, the populations of different energy levels are determined by their respective temperatures. So, for star_1 and star_2, the ratio of populations of two energy levels (say, level
