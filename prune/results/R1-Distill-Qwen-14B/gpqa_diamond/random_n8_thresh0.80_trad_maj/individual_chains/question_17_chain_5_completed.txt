Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex here is the one we're looking at. The concentration given is 0.02 M for this complex. I think I need to relate the concentration of the complex to the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, so the formation constant K is given. I think the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, right? So Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I suppose the pH is such that EDTA is in its active form, which is usually the deprotonated form that can bind metals. So maybe I don't have to worry about the different EDTA species and can treat the solution as having a certain concentration of EDTA and Ca²+ ions.

Wait, but wait. The solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. So let me think about the equilibrium.

The formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So I can rearrange this to find [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2-]/( Kf * [EDTA^4-] )

But wait, we don't know [EDTA^4-], do we? Because the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, but we don't know how much free EDTA is around. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the solution is such that the majority of the EDTA is in the form of the complex, so the free EDTA concentration is negligible. Or is there another approach?

Wait, no, perhaps in this case, the concentration of the complex is given, and assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, so the concentration of EDTA is the same as the free EDTA concentration. Wait, no, because the EDTA is either bound to calcium or free.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is considering the formation of the complex, and the 0.02 M is the concentration of the complex, so the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are zero. But no, that can't be right because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we assume that x amount dissociates. So, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x. But wait, in reality, the complex might be in solution, so maybe when it dissociates, the concentrations are x each.

Wait, but Kf is given as 5e10, which is a large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be minimal, meaning x would be small compared to 0.02 M. So perhaps we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as approximately 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x.

So, substituting into Kf: Kf ≈ (0.02) / (x * x) ) → 5e10 ≈ 0.02/(x²)

So, solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 /5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) → x² = 2/(5e12) → x = sqrt(2/(5e12)) ) → sqrt(4e-13) → Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 2/(5e10) * 0.02? Wait, no, the Kf is 5e10. So, Kf = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

So, [complex] is 0.02 M. So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2) → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = (2e-2)/(5e10) → 2e-2 is 2 *1e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Then, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate 4e-13's square root.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 (since 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7). So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

So, x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this value.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. So, Kf = 5e10 = 0.02/(x²). So x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So yes, that's correct.

So, the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, so that's the answer.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M and assuming the dissociation of the complex is minimal (due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \)), we approximate \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
