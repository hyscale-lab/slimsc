Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It underwent a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what the original compound was from the options provided.

Wait, what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Oh right, it's DBU (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), which is often used as a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So, when DBU is involved, especially in epoxide reactions, I think it's probably used for opening epoxides. Wait, but wait—no, wait. Oh, wait, DBU is a base, so maybe it's used in elimination reactions or for deprotonation steps. Alternatively, in some cases, it can be a catalyst for certain reactions.

But wait, the reaction here is that Compound X is treated with DBU. So, perhaps the reaction is ring-opening of an epoxide. Because when epoxides are treated with strong bases, they can open up in a nucleophilic ring-opening. Alternatively, since DBU is a base, maybe it's deprotonating something, leading to a rearrangement or elimination.

Wait, looking at the options, all of them are epoxides (oxirane derivatives). So Compound X is an epoxide. Then, when treated with DBU, perhaps the epoxide ring is opening. But wait, the product's NMR is given. So the product is the result after the reaction. So the options are all possible epoxide structures, and the product is the opened form or perhaps something else.

Wait, the product's NMR. Let me look at the 1H and 13C NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s). So two singlets, each integrating for 3H. Singlets probably mean no neighboring hydrogens. So these are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have adjacent protons. Maybe attached to an aromatic ring or an electronegative atom.

Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So aromatic protons. Looking at the integrals, that's 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Because in para substitution, you can have two doublets for the adjacent positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a styryl group, which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated aromatic group.

Wait, looking at the integration: 6.75 (1H, d), which could be a proton on a double bond, perhaps, as part of a styryl group. Then 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents that create another doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic region shows a substitution pattern with two doublets, each integrating two protons. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent with a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the integration. The total aromatic protons would be 1+2+1+2 = 6H, which makes sense for a benzene ring (assuming one substituent leads to splitting of the ring into different proton environments).

Wait, but benzene has six H. So if we have a substituent in the para position, perhaps we get two doublets each with 2H, but the integration here isn't adding up to that. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent with another substituent attached, such as a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a styryl group (a vinyl group attached to benzene), which would have the doublet for the protons on the double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has an aromatic ring and a conjugated double bond.

Let me look at the 13C NMR data. The 13C NMR has the following:

21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s). Those are likely to be methyl groups attached to something. 21.3 is around where methyl groups attached to oxygen (like OCH3) would appear. Wait, but 21.3 is a bit low for that. Alternatively, it's a
