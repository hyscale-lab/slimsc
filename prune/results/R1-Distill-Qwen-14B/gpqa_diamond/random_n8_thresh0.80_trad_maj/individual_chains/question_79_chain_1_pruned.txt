Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's take it step by step. 

The question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction and the resulting NMR spectra. The reaction involves treating Compound X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to match it to one of the four options.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bulky base, often used in reactions that require epoxide openings, especially under kinetic conditions. It's known to induce ring-opening of epoxides, typically leading to the more substituted (more stable) carbocation intermediate because the base abstracts a proton that's more acidic, which is usually adjacent to the more substituted carbon.

So, Compound X is likely an epoxide because it's reacting with a base to form a product. Let's look at the options. All the options except option D are named with "oxirane," which is another name for epoxide. Wait, actually, option D is "2-styrylepoxide," which is also an epoxide. Hmm, maybe I should think about that.

Wait, the product is formed after the reaction, so the product would be the result of the base-induced epoxide ring opening. So, the product's structure can be inferred from the NMR data.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, there are two singlets, both 3H. One at 2.28 and 2.31. These are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signal—maybe adjacent to an electronegative group or in a symmetric environment.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Looking at this, maybe there are two doublets, each integrating to 1 and 2 H, respectively, but wait, the numbers don't add up. Let me count: 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). That's 6 H in the aromatic region. So a benzene ring? Maybe a para-substituted ring?

Wait, maybe it's a substituted benzene with some substituents causing the splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's two different aromatic rings or substituents.

13C NMR:
δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1
