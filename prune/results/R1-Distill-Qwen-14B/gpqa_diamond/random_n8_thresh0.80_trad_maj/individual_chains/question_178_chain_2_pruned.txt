Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory. Hmm, the Lagrangian is given as L_int = κψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I'm a bit rusty, but I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, mass dimensions. Right, in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 since the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 because the integral over d^4x makes the action dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

The term here is κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me break it down.

First, what's the dimension of each field? ψ is a Dirac spinor, which has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, the kinetic term is ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which is dimension 4. ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ also 3/2.

Now σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices). So [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless, so σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ would be (3/2 + 3/2) = 3, but wait, that's without considering the sigma. Oh, right, σ is dimensionless, so the product ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{mu nu} comes from the gauge field A, which has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term for A is like ∂mu A_nu - ∂nu A_mu, each derivative has dimension 1, and each A has dimension 1. So F^{mu nu} is dimension 2, because it's derivative of A, which is 1 +1=2.

So putting it together: the term κψ̄ σ F. The dimensions would be:

κ (unknown) * (ψ̄ σ ψ) (dimension 3) * F (dimension 2) = 4 (since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4).

So equation: [κ] + 3 + 2 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So options A and C are possibilities.

Now, renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling constants determines the superficial degree of divergence of Feynman diagrams. For renormalizability, the coupling constants must have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (in 4 dimensions) because higher dimensions would lead to non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, more accurately, in 4 dimensions, a renormalizable interaction must have coupling constants with mass dimension ≥ 0. Because each coupling's dimension is (4 - sum of fields in the term). Let me think: the term is L = g φ^n, then the dimension of g is 4 - n*(dim φ). For φ^n, each φ is dimension (d-2)/2, but in 4d, it's (4-2)/2 = 1. So for g φ^3, the dimension of g would be 4 - 3*1=1, which is positive.

Wait, no, in this case, the term isn't a simple φ^n. It's a term involving ψ, σ, and F. But σ is a product of gamma matrices, so it's a composite operator (like a bilinear in ψ), but dimensionless. So let's think about the term: ψ̄ σ ψ F. Hmm.

Wait, the term is a four-component term? Let me count the fields. ψ is a spinor, ψ̄ is another. σ is a product of gammas, so dimensionless. F is a field strength, which is like two derivatives of the gauge field, so dimension 2.

So the term is L = κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3. F is 2. So 3+2=5. Wait, but the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So how is that possible?

Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Wait
