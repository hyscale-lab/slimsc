Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and zero otherwise. Then I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this operator isn't the usual Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli matrices have elements like [[0,1],[1,0]] for sigma_x, but this A matrix is 2x2 since it's acting on spin-1/2 states. So, let's think: if i ≠ j, A_ij = ħ/2, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, A would look like:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Wait, is that correct? Because for 2x2, i and j can be 1 and 2. So A_12 = hbar/2, A_21 = hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So yes, that's the matrix.

Wait, but what is this operator? I think it's the sigma_x operator scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply each element by ħ/2, we get the matrix A. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x. Because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2. But wait, perhaps the operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x. Because if an operator is a scaled version, their eigenstates are the same. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the A operator. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis.
