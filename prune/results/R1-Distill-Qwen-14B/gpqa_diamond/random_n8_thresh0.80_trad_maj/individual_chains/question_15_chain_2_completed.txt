Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The question gives some specific details, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh wait, wait, the formula I think is something like R_planet / R_star, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more about the orbital plane's orientation. Oh right, the probability is based on the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. So the probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, that's the area of the disk as seen from Earth. Or wait, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / a) * (something about the inclination). Oh right, the transit probability is given by (R_p / a) * (1 + (R_p / a)), but wait, that sounds more like the depth of the transit. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. The probability that a planet's orbit is aligned so that it transits from our point of view depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. I think the formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a. Wait, but actually, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Or is it the planet's radius? No, wait, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis squared? Or perhaps it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transit probability equation. I recall that the transit probability is approximately (R*/a) * (1 + (R_p/a)) , but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it's (R_p)/(a * (1 - e)) ), where e is the eccentricity. But here, both orbits are circular, so e=0. So it's (R_p)/(a).

Wait, no, wait. I think the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Let me think. The probability that a planet transits is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (some factor). Oh wait, maybe it's (R_planet + R_star) / a, but that can't be right because as a increases, the probability should decrease, which it does in this case.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for the probability of a transit is P = (R_star / a) * (something else). Or perhaps it's (R_p / a) + (R_* / a), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. 

Wait, no, actually, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / a

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because if R_p + R_* is larger than a, the probability would be greater than 1, which isn't possible. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up now, but I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_*)/a, assuming that the planet's orbit is randomly oriented. Because the orbital plane's orientation is random, the probability that it's aligned enough for a transit is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the area where the planet's position would cause a transit is a circle with diameter R_* + R_p. So the probability is (R_* + R_p) / (a), but again, this might be a simplification.

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula is (R_* + R_p) / (a + R_* + R_p). No, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + R_planet / R_star), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another source I've read before says that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a) times (something involving the star's radius), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 + R_p/R_*), but that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the geometry. The probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, intersects the line of sight to the star. The planet will transit if its orbital plane is within an angle θ from our line of sight, where θ is determined by the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. The area of the sky where the planet's orbit is aligned for a transit is a circle with radius R = (R_* + R_p) / a. So the probability is the area of this circle divided by the total possible area, which would be ( (R_* + R_p)/a )^2. But wait, that's the area, but probability is area divided by something, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the circle (R_* + R_p)/a to the area of the sphere (since the planet's orbital plane can be at any inclination). Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio (R_* + R_p) / a, since for a randomly oriented orbit, the chance that the inclination is just right is proportional to that ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the basics. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability of this is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by something else. So, P = (R_* + R_p) / a. But wait, for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_*/a) * (something). Oh wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*) ) ), but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * ( (R_p + R_*) / R_* ), but that's not making much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_* + R_p) / (a * (1 - e)) ), but since e=0, it's (R_* + R_p)/a. But wait, for a planet to transit, the orbital inclination must be within a certain range. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance. So P = (diameter of star) / (distance of planet's orbit) * (something else). So P = (2R_*) / (2a) ) = R_* / a.

Wait, maybe that's it. So the probability is proportional to (R_*) / a. Because the star's radius determines the size of the area from which the planet's position can cause a transit, and the semi-major axis determines the size of the orbit. So if a is larger, the probability is lower.

Wait, but in reality, the probability is (R_*)/a multiplied by (something involving the planet's size). Hmm, perhaps the exact formula is P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but since for Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a.

So, let's proceed with that assumption. So, P is proportional to R_* / a.

Now, the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_*1 = R_*2. So the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis, a.

Wait, but wait, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) )/(4π²) ) * P^2. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So a^3 is proportional to (M_*) * P^2. So a is proportional to (M_* * P^2 )^(1/3).

So, a = k * (M_* * P )^(1/3), where k is a constant.

Wait, so the semi-major axis a is proportional to (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Hmm, so for the two planets:

Planet_1 has an orbital period P1 = P_2 /3, since its period is three times shorter. Because the question says that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

The stars' masses are M1 = 2 * M2. So M1 = 2 M2.

So, a1 = k * (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) = k * (2 M2)^(1/3) * ( (P2/3) )^(2/3 )

Similarly, a2 = k * (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3 )

So, let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 = k * (2)^{1/3} * (M2)^{1/3} * (P2/(3) )^{2/3 }

= k * (2)^{1/3} * (M2 P2^2 )^{1/3} * (1/3)^{2/3 }

= k * (2)^{1/3} * (1/3)^{2/3} * (M2 P2^2 )^{1/3 }

a2 =k * (M2)^{1/3} * (P2)^{2/3} = k ( M2 P2^2 )^{1/3 }

So, the ratio a1/a2 = [ (2)^{1/3} * (1/3)^{2/3} ) ] 

Because a1 = a2 * [ (2/3^2 )^{1/3} ]

Wait, let me compute the numerical factor.

The ratio a1/a2 = [ 2^{1/3} * (1/3)^{2/3} ] 

Which can be written as (2/(3^2))^{1/3} = (2/9)^{1/3} ≈ (0.222)^{1/3} ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2. Or a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Wait, so a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, so it's closer to its star (if the star is more massive, but wait in this case M1 is 2 M2, so let's see: for a given period, a higher mass star would have a planet further away? Hmm, but here P1 is shorter than P2, so let's see how these factors combine.

But regardless, the transit probability P is proportional to R_* / a.

Since R_* is the same for both stars, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So, P1 = k * (R_*) / a1

P2 = k * (R_*) / a2

So the ratio P2/P1 = (1/a2) / (1/a1) ) = a1 / a2.

Wait, from earlier, a1 is smaller than a2, so a1/a2 is less than 1. So P2 is higher than P1? Wait no, the ratio P2/P1 = (R_* / a2) / (R_* / a1) ) = a1 / a2.

Wait, wait no, let me think again.

If P is proportional to (R_*)/a, then P1 = (R_*) / a1, P2 = (R_*) / a2.

So P2 / P1 = (R_* / a2) / (R_* / a1) ) = a1 / a2.

We found that a1/a2 is approximately 0.606. So P2 is about 0.606 times P1. Wait, that can't be, because a1 is smaller than a2, so 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2, so P1 is larger than P2. Because a1 is smaller, so R_*/a1 is larger.

So higher transit probability for Planet_1.

Wait, but the question says the researchers chose the planet that has the highest probability. If P1 is higher, they would choose Planet_1. But let's get the actual numbers.

Wait, let's compute a1/a2 again. Let me re-calculate.

a1 = (M1 * P1^2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G(M_*) P^2 )/(4π² )

So a = [ G(M_*) P^2/(4π²) ]^(1/3 )

Thus, a is proportional to (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 )

So, a1/a2 = [ (M1 / M2 ) * (P1 / P2 )^2 ]^(1/3 )

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = (1/3) P2.

So:

a1/a2 = [ (2/1) * ( (1/3) / 1 )^2 ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2 * (1/9) ]^(1/3 )

= (2/9 )^(1/3 )

Which is approximately 0.606, as before.

So a1 = 0.606 * a2.

So for the transit probability, P1 = R_* / a1.

Since R_* is same for both, P1 = (R_*) / (0.606 a2 ) ≈ 1.65 * (R_*/a2 )

But P2 is (R_*)/a2.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but according to the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, let me think again. Because when I compute a1/a2 as 0.606, which means a1 is smaller than a2. So R_*/a1 would be bigger than R_*/a2.

So P1 = R_*/a1 ≈ 1.65 * ( R_*/a2 ) = 1.65 * P2.

So P1 is higher than P2 by a factor of about 1.65.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which seems too high. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but I should double-check my math.

Wait, a1 is (M1 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

M1 is 2 M2, P1 is (1/3) P2.

So (M1 P1^2 ) = 2 M2 * ( (P2/3)^2 ) = 2 M2 * P2^2 /9 = (2/9) M2 P2^2.

Similarly, a2 is (M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2/9) )^(1/3 ) ] = (2/9)^(1/3 ) ≈ (0.222)^(0.333) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So R_*/a1 is (R_*/a2) / 0.606 ≈ (R_*/a2 ) * 1.648.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2.

Which means Planet_1 has a higher probability, so they should choose Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So that's the correct answer.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \).

The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:  
\[
a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2
\]
Thus,  
\[
a \propto \left(M_* \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive)
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter)

The ratio of their semi-major axes is:  
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3}
\]
Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):  
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9}}{P_2^2}\right)^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:  
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
Substituting \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.606 \):  
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher probability.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 2.7 times higher probability.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller semi-major axis, making it the better choice for observation. The researchers should prefer Planet_1.
