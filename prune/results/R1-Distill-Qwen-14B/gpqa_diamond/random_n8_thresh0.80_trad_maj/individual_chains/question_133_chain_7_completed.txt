Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given—136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So in solution, phosphate can take different forms depending on the pH. We have various species like H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

The salts given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociations. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So when these two salts are dissolved in water, we'll have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution will form a buffer because of the presence of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). This buffer system will resist changes in pH, but I'm not directly asked about pH. Instead, I'm asked about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm, but orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-. So to find [PO4^3-], I need to consider the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.

Wait, let me think. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ⇌ H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+. The third is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+. So each Ka corresponds to each step. So the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the third dissociation constant, Ka3.

But wait, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So in solution, the HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-. But considering the presence of both, perhaps the PO4^3- concentration is very low because the solution is buffered around the second dissociation.

Wait, but wait, the problem is that the solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be calculated from the masses given. Let me compute those first.

So, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 moles. Since each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-, the concentration is 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005605 mol. Each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2- (since Na2HPO4 → 2Na+ + HPO4^2-), so concentration is 0.005605 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028025 M.

So now, in solution, [H2PO4^-] = about 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] = about 0.0280 M. The pH of this solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since that's the buffer system here). Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]).

Wait, but in this case, the buffer is between H2PO4^- (weak acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base). So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) = 7.208 + log(0.028025 / 0.0367). Let me calculate that ratio: 0.028025 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765. Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115. So pH ≈ 7.208 -0.115 ≈7.093.

Wait, but wait, this might not be directly needed for the orthophosphate concentration. Because orthophosphate is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would come from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka for this is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So the concentration of PO4^3- will be determined by this third dissociation.

But HPO4^2- is present at 0.0280 M, and in solution, some of it will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. But since the solution is buffered around pH ~7, which is higher than the pKa3 (which is around 11.7, since pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So at pH 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- would be extremely low. Because in a solution with pH lower than pKa, the species remains protonated (the acid form). So at pH 7, HPO4^2- is more than 10^4 times more than PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should actually calculate it. Let's think. The concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the third dissociation. The expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.0280 M. [H+] is... well, from the buffer calculation, the pH is about 7.09, so [H+] is 10^-7.09 ≈ approx 8.2e-8 M.

So plugging in the numbers: [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0280) / (8.2e-8) ≈ (5.04e-14) / (8.2e-8) ≈ approximately 6.146e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.

[H+] = 10^-7.093. Let me compute 7.093: 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 0.093 on the exponent would be 10^0.093 ≈ about 1.24 (since 10^0.1 is ~1.258). So 10^-7.093 = 1/(10^7.093) ≈ 1/(1.24e7) ≈ 8.06e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.06e-8).

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 ≈5.0445e-14.

Divide by 8.06e-8: 5.0445e-14 /8.06e-8 = approx (5.0445 /8.06) * 1e-6.

5.0445 /8.06 ≈ 0.626. So 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. That's very close to what I got. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but what about the contribution from the autoionization of water or other sources? I don't think that's significant here because the concentration is so low.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact value of [H+]. Let me recalculate [H+] more precisely.

pH = 7.093 → [H+] = 10^-7.093.

Calculating 10^-7.093: Let's break it down.

7.093 = 7 + 0.093.

10^7 = 1e7.

10^0.093: compute ln(10^0.093) = 0.093 * ln(10) ≈ 0.093 *2.302585 ≈0.2140.

So e^0.214 ≈ 1.2387. So 10^0.093 ≈ 1.2387.

So 10^7.093 = 1e7 * 1.2387 = 1.2387e7.

Thus, [H+] = 1 / 1.2387e7 ≈8.06e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.06e-8) → let me compute it step by step.

1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = 5.0445e-14.

Divide by 8.06e-8: 5.0445e-14 /8.06e-8 = (5.0445 /8.06) *1e-6.

5.0445 /8.06 ≈0.626.

So 0.626e-6 =6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So that's the answer.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of H₃PO₄ and the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, with molecular weights 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L).

### Step 1: Calculate the moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **For KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{Mw}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{\text{moles}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.00734}{0.2} \approx 0.0367 \, \text{M} \).  
  This contributes 0.0367 M H₂PO₄⁻.

- **For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{Mw}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005605 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{\text{moles}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.005605}{0.2} \approx 0.0280 \, \text{M} \).  
  This contributes 0.0280 M HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer system
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (its conjugate base), with the second dissociation constant \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). The pH is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
\]
- \( \text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \).  
- Ratio = \( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.0280}{0.0367} \approx 0.765 \).  
- \( \log(0.765) \approx -0.115 \).  
- \( \text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.115 \approx 7.093 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
Orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) are formed by the third dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}.
\]
The third dissociation constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the expression for \( K_a3 \):  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]
- \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.06 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).  
- \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.0280)}{8.06 \times 10^{-8}} \).  
  Numerator: \( (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.0280) \approx 5.0445 \times 10^{-14} \).  
  Denominator: \( 8.06 \times 10^{-8} \).  
  \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.0445 \times 10^{-14}}{8.06 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
