Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So I'm dealing with a complex ion here. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability of these complexes is given by a formation constant, K. K is usually a very large number, which indicates that the complex is very stable.

The question gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. I think that means the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Because EDTA forms a 1:1 complex with Ca^2+ ions, the formula would be CaY^2-, right? So each mole of CaY^2- represents one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So if the complex is 0.02 M, does that mean that the calcium concentration is 0.02 M? No, wait. Because EDTA is a ligand that binds to Ca^2+, the presence of EDTA would actually affect the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution.

I think this is a problem involving the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA (Y^4-). The reaction would be:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The equilibrium expression for this reaction is K = [Ca^2+][Y^4-] / [CaY^2-]. The K given is 5x10^10, which is a huge number, so the complex is very stable. That means the dissociation doesn't happen much, so the concentrations of Ca^2+ and Y^4- would be very low compared to the concentration of the complex.

Wait, but how does that relate to finding the concentration of Ca^2+?

In a solution where the only source of Ca^2+ is the dissociation of CaY^2-, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaY^2-] as 0.02 M. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that dissociate. Then, the concentration of Y^4- would also be x, because each mole of CaY^2- that dissociates produces one mole of each. So, [Ca^2+] = x, [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY^2-] is approximately 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 M to simplify the calculations.

So putting this into the K expression:

K = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = x² / 0.02

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02

Calculate 5e10 * 0.02. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 5e10 * 2e-2 is 1e9. So x² = 1e9.

Taking the square root of both sides, x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4. Wait, no, wait. Wait 1e9 is 10^9. The square root of 10^9 is 10^(4.5), which is 3.16e4 (since 10^4 is 10000, 10^4.5 is about 31622.7766). Wait, but that can't be right because 3e4 is 30,000, which is way higher than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Hmm, that suggests that my initial assumption that x is negligible is wrong. Because if x is about 3e4 M, but the complex concentration is 0.02 M, that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the K expression. Let me think again. The correct formation constant is Kf, which is the formation of the complex from its ions. So the reaction is:

Ca^2+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-

The Kf for this reaction is [CaY^2-] / ( [Ca^2+][Y^4-] ) ) = 5e10.

Wait, so the expression I used earlier was correct for K, but perhaps I should have considered that when the complex dissociates, the product of the ions' concentrations is K^-1. Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Wait, the K given is the formation constant, Kf. So Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

So the dissociation equilibrium is K = 1/(Kf) = [Ca^2+][Y^4-] / [CaY^2-] = 1/(5e10) ≈ 2e-11.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Because when the problem gives K, is it the dissociation constant or the formation constant? The problem says KCa-EDTA = 5e10, which I think refers to the formation constant Kf, because formation constants are typically large. So Kf = 5e10.

But when setting up the dissociation equilibrium, the K for dissociation is Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So in the dissociation reaction:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The Kd = 2e-11.

So the expression is Kd = ([Ca^2+][Y^4-])/[CaY^2-].

Let me denote the concentration of CaY^2- as 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. So [Ca^2+] = x, [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x. But since Kd is very small (2e-11), x is going to be much smaller than 0.02, so [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into Kd:

( x * x ) / 0.02 = 2e-11

=> x² = 0.02 * 2e-11
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

Hmm, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the calcium ion concentration.

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is correct, and this is the right approach.

Wait, let me check my steps again.

1. The problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The given K is the formation constant Kf = 5e10. So for the dissociation, Kd = 1/Kf = 2e-11.

2. The dissociation reaction: CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-.

3. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ formed. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and dissociation is small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02.

4. The Kd expression: x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

5. Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

6. x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.32e-7.

So that gives [Ca^2+] as approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, so that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So that's the concentration of the complex. So the solution initially has 0.02 M of CaY^2-.

As the complex dissociates, each mole of CaY^2- gives one mole each of Ca^2+ and Y^4-. So when x is the amount dissociated, [Ca^2+] = x, [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression is correct, and the calculation leads to x being 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_f \) for the complex is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate from the complex. Since the dissociation is small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M), we approximate \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The dissociation constant expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).**
