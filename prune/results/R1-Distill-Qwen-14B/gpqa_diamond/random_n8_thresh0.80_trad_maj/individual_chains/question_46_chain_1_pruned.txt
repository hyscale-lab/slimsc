Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs catalyst, especially the first-generation one, is good for ring-closing metathesis and some ring-opening, but I think it's mainly for ring-closing and cross metathesis. So what's the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene?

Let me draw that. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂ something? Wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-? No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-? Hmm, wait, pent is five carbons. Let me count.

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see: 3-methylpent-1-ene. The parent chain is pent, so five carbons. The double bond is from C1 to C2 (since it's pent-1-ene). And a methyl group is attached to C3.

So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, but wait, that's six carbons. Oh no, wait, pent means five carbons. So perhaps:

Actually, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Wait, but wait, the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2-CH3)-? No, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure should be:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, that's six carbons. So that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe
