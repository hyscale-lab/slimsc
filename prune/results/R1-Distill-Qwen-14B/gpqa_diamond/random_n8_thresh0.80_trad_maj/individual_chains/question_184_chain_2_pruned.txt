Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me the desired product with a high yield.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. Let me draw it out mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. So, numbering the ring, the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in 1, and nitro in 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. 

Now, I need to think about the order of adding these groups because the order of substitution will affect the directing effects and the positions where new groups attach.

Benzene is the starting material. The substituents can be added via electrophilic substitution reactions, and the order in which we add them will determine where each group ends up.

The substituents in the target are:

1. tert-butyl (strongly activating, since it's an alkyl group; but wait, no, wait. Wait, the tert-butyl is actually a bulky group, but it's an activating group because it's an alkyl substituent. But wait, actually, wait. Wait, no, the tert-butyl group is an activating group because it donates electrons through inductive effect? Wait, no, alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds, making the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, they are ortho/para directors.

Wait, but nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para-directing. So, knowing that, the order in which these substituents are added will influence where the next group goes.

Wait, but the target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So I need to plan how to add them.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the possible sequences. Let's list the substituents:

- tert-butyl (from tert-butyl chloride via Friedel-Crafts alkylation)
- ethoxy (from ethoxy bromide via nucleophilic substitution, but wait, no. Wait, ethoxy is an ether. To make an ethoxy group on benzene, we can perform an etherification, perhaps via the nucleophilic aromatic substitution or via the use of a good leaving group? Alternatively, maybe via a Williamson-type synthesis, but benzene isn't so good for that. Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups. But for ether groups, perhaps it's better to do a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, no, benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts to add an ether group directly. Wait, wait. To introduce an ethoxy group, maybe we can use an ethoxy group via the O-substitution. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a directing group approach.

Wait, but perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires activating groups. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced via a different method.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the directing effects and the order of addition. Let's consider the substituents in the target:

At positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So the nitro group is in position 3, which is adjacent to the ethoxy in position 1.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, so if the nitro is added after the ethoxy and the tert-butyl, where would it go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let me think.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents. Let me plan the order of addition.

Option 1: Add nitro first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating and meta-directing. So if I add nitro first, then the next substituents would go into the meta positions relative to the nitro.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps adding the nitro group last because it's a strong deactivating group would be better. Because adding a deactivating group after activating groups would make the ring less reactive, but maybe that's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the order should be:

1. Add the tert-butyl group first via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Since it's an activating group, it would direct the next substituents to ortho and para positions.

2. Then add the nitro group. Since nitro is a meta director, but the ring is already substituted with tert-butyl. Wait, but the tert-butyl is an activating group, so when adding nitro, it would go to the meta position relative to the tert-butyl? Or do I have to consider which substituent is more directive?

Wait, in a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can direct the next substituent based on their activating/deactivating nature and their positions. But which substituent is more influential? The activating groups are more directive than deactivating ones, but in this case, if we have a nitro group and an alkyl group, the alkyl group is activating and the nitro is deactivating. So when adding after both are present, which substituent directs?

Wait,
