Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A, B, C, D with pairs of numbers.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decays, the total energy must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

The pion's rest energy is its mass energy, so that's 139.6 MeV. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is nearly massless, so its rest energy is negligible. Let's treat the neutrino as having zero rest mass for simplicity.

So the total energy after decay must equal the initial energy of the pion. The muon's total energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's total energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

Wait, but how do the energies split between the two particles?

I think I can use conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote:
- E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV, so E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu
- Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu c, because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², and m is zero.

From conservation of momentum, the magnitudes of the muon and neutrino momenta must be equal because they're moving in opposite directions. So p_mu = p_nu.

Let me write down the equations:

1. Energy conservation:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
=> 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu

But E_nu = p_nu c. And since p_mu = p_nu (same magnitude), and for the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) 

Also, from momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu. So E_nu = p_mu c.

Let me denote p = p_mu = p_nu. Then:

139.6 = (sqrt( p^2 c^2 + 105.7^2 )) + p c

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root, but that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach.

I recall that in such decay processes, the maximum possible kinetic energy of the muon occurs when the neutrino has the least possible energy, but since the neutrino is massless, it can take any amount of energy down to zero.
