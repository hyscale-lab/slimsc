Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The masses given are 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, the muon and the neutrino. 

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? I think the mass of a neutrino is considered to be negligible compared to the other particles in these kinds of problems. So maybe I can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero. That should simplify things.

Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum of the system must still be zero because of conservation of momentum. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That is, p_mu = -p_nu. Or, in magnitude, their momenta are the same.

Now, I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved. So I'll need to set up equations based on those principles.

Let me denote the rest mass of the pion as m_pi, the muon as m_mu, and the neutrino as m_nu (which is almost zero).

The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi * c². Since it's at rest, kinetic energy is zero. So E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. But for the neutrino, since m_nu is zero, E_nu = p_nu * c. Because for a massless particle, energy is pc.

So let's write the energy conservation equation:

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu

E_initial = (gamma * m_mu c²) + (p_nu c) 

But since the neutrino's momentum is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the muon's, p_mu = p_nu. So p_mu = p_nu = p.

So for the muon, its energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), by the relativistic energy equation.

So putting it all together:

m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c

Let me divide both sides by c² for simplicity:

m_pi = sqrt( (p^2 c²) / c^4 + (m_mu^2 c^4) / c^4 ) + (p c ) / c² * c

Wait, maybe I should keep it in terms of MeV, so units are easier. Let me think in terms of MeV.

So m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p 

Wait, because when we have E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ), so in units where c=1, E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ), but here, since we're working in MeV, and c is 1 in these units (since MeV and other units are scaled accordingly), perhaps I can treat everything in terms of MeV and set c=1. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ), and E_nu = p.

So the equation is 139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange it to solve for p.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

139.6 - p = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Now I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * p + p² = p² + (105.7)^2

Simplify by subtracting p^2 from both sides:

139.6² - 2*139.6 p = (105.7)^2

Calculate 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6^2 = let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV²

105.7^2 = 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that:

100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2 = 32.49, and 2 * 100 *5.7 = 1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So plugging in the numbers:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 p = 11172.49

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2*139.6 p

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 * p

Calculate 2 *139.6 = 279.2

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me approximate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So maybe 29.7?

Wait wait, 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376.

So 8376 is 60.33 more than 8315.67.

So 29.7 * 279.2 = approximately 8315.67.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 279.2 * p = 8315.67

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.764 MeV/c?

Wait, but wait, the units here. Since everything is in MeV, and p is in units of MeV/c, but since we set c=1, perhaps p is in MeV/c, but that's getting a bit confusing. For the purposes of this problem, maybe I can just proceed with the numbers.

So p ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me calculate that exactly.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (because 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2*1=279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8). 

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So 29 + (218.87 / 279.2) → 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 → approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when I plug p back into the energy equation, let me check.

Wait, let me recalculate 139.6 - p. 139.6 -29.783 ≈ 109.817 MeV.

The sqrt(p² + 105.7²) is sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

29.783^2 is about 887, 105.7^2 is 11172.49. So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49 → sqrt(12059.49) ≈ 109.817. So that checks out.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is p*c, but since c=1 in these units, E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino's energy is all kinetic since it's massless. Because E = pc, and rest mass energy is zero. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.78 MeV.

For the muon, its total energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(887 + 11172.49) → sqrt(12059.49) ≈ 109.817 MeV.

The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So its kinetic energy is total energy minus rest energy: 109.817 - 105.7 ≈4.117 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check that. 109.817 minus 105.7 is 4.117 MeV.

So the muon's KE is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV → no, too low.

B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV → no, muon's KE is higher than calculated.

C) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV → no, neutrino's KE is higher.

D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV → yes, matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Neutrino's KE is 29.78, which is approximately 29.8, and the muon's KE is 4.12, so option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, \( \pi^+ \), into a muon, \( \mu^+ \), and a neutrino, \( \nu \). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino's mass is negligible (\( m_\nu \approx 0 \)).

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]  
   The muon's energy is \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \), where \( p \) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. The neutrino's energy is \( E_\nu = p \), as it is massless. Thus:  
   \[
   139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. The muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu = p.
   \]

### Solving for \( p \)
Rearranging the energy equation:  
\[
139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.
\]  
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 105.7^2.
\]  
Substituting \( 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):  
\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 11172.49.
\]  
\[
8315.67 = 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Neutrino's Energy**:  
   The neutrino's energy is \( E_\nu = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \). Since the neutrino is massless, this is its kinetic energy.

2. **Muon's Energy and Kinetic Energy**:  
   The muon's total energy is \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx \sqrt{887 + 11172.49} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.82 - 105.7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The muon's kinetic energy is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
