Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that the parallax angle (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance of a star. So, a star with a small parallax is very far away, and a larger parallax means it's closer. Got it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, there are the same number of stars in a cubic parsec, regardless of where you are in the universe. Or wait, maybe it's uniform in some other way. Wait, no, if the distribution is uniform in space, then the number per volume is constant.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Oh, right. Parallax is related to distance (d), since parallax (in arcseconds) is 1/d (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d. So, the parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Let me think about how the number of stars in a given parallax range depends on the parallax. Suppose I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. I need to find how the number of stars in that range, N, depends on plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars depends on the volume of space between two spheres (since parallax relates to how far away the stars are). The volume between two spheres of radius d and d+dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between r and r + dr is roughly 4πr² dr.

But wait, since plx is inversely proportional to d, d = 1/plx. So, let's express everything in terms of plx. Let me see, if plx is p, then d = 1/p. So, plx varies from p to p + delta_p. The corresponding distance is d and d + delta_d, but delta_d
