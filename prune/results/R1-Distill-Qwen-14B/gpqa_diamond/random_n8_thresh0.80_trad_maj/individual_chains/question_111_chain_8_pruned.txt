Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down.

First, the reactions:

1. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The product is labeled A.
2. 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and H2O. The product is labeled B.

The options for A and B are given, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Let me tackle the first reaction first. 

Reaction A: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So, this sounds like an enolate formation reaction. Since ethyl acrylate is an electrophile, it's probably undergoing a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, wait. Wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, with substituents at positions 2 and 6. The structure would have a cyclohexane ring, with a ketone group at C1. So, the chair conformation would have the ketone axial or equatorial? Oh, wait, in cyclohexanones, the ketone is usually axial because that's more stable (since the carbonyl group is bulky and prefers being axial to minimize strain).

But when forming enolates, the base deprotonates the alpha carbon. The t-BuOK is bulky, so it's more likely to abstract the less hindered alpha proton. So, the possible alpha positions in the cyclohexanone are at C2 and C3 (adjacent to the ketone at C1). Wait, let's visualize this.

The molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ring is six-membered. At position 1, there's a ketone. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Wait, wait. The substituents are 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. So, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or is it that the 2 position has an ethyl, and the 6 position has a methyl, in addition to another methyl on the 2 position? Let me parse that.

The name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there are two substituents: ethyl and methyl groups. Position 6 has a methyl group. So, the structure is: 

Positions: 1 (ketone), 2 (ethyl and methyl), 6 (methyl). So, the ring looks like it's substituted at 2,6, and 1 (the ketone). 

When forming the enolate, the alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the alpha carbons are at C2 and possibly C3. Wait, in cyclohexanones, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are C2 and C6. Because the ring is cyclohexane, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So the alpha positions are C2 and C6.

But in this molecule, both C2 and C6 have substituents. At C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group. At C6, a methyl. So, when the base comes in, which proton is more acidic and which is more accessible?

t-BuOK is bulky, so it will prefer the less hindered site. Let's look at the alpha carbons. C2 has multiple substituents (ethyl and methyl), which would make the protons here more hindered. C6 has a methyl group. So, perhaps the base would abstract a proton from C6, which is less substituted, making the enolate at C6.

Wait, but wait. The substituents at C2 are more bulky. So maybe the enolate forms at C6, since that's less hindered. Once the enolate is formed, it will attack the electrophilic alpha position of ethyl acrylate.

Wait, no. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So, when the enolate forms, it's going to perform a conjugate addition (Michael addition) to the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

So, the enolate (the conjugate base) will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

So, the cyclohexanone enolate adds to the acrylate. Let me think about the structure.

The original ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. After deprotonation, the enolate would have a negative charge at C6 (assuming it's the less hindered site), but actually, wait, the enolate forms at the alpha carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, if the ketone is at C1, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. So, the enolate would form at either C2 or C6.

But since the substituents at C2 are more bulky (ethyl and methyl), the base (t-BuOK) would prefer the less hindered site, which is C6. So, the enolate forms at C6.

Wait, but enolate formation is about the deprotonation of an alpha proton. So, the enolate would have the negative charge on the carbon where the proton was abstracted, which is adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, if the enolate forms at C6, that would be the site of attack. Then, the enolate would attack the acrylate.

The acrylate is ethyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOEt. The alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The enolate (nucleophile) would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 end of the CH2=CHCOOEt), adding to that position.

So, the cyclohexanone enolate would attack the acrylate, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexane and the beta carbon of the ac
