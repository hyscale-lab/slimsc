Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

We have 10,000 identical systems. Each system has a particle that's under the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, the wave function ψ(x) is a complex number: the real part is a divided by the square root of (1 + x), and the imaginary part is -0.5 (since i is the imaginary unit).

The question is about finding the value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Wait, I remember that for wave functions in quantum mechanics, the probability density must be normalized so that the total probability is 1. Because when you square the absolute value of the wave function, you get the probability density, and the integral of that over all space should be 1.

So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1. Because the problem states that when measuring, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, this part is the normalization condition.

Let me write down the wave function:

ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i.

So, the absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + [0.25], because the imaginary part is (-0.5i), so when you square it, (i^2 is -1), but wait, actually, the absolute square is (real part)^2 plus (imaginary part)^2. Since the imaginary part is -0.5i, the coefficient is -0.5, so its square is (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, no. Wait, the wave function is ψ = A + iB, so |ψ|² = (A)^2 + (B)^2. Here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5. So, B squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So yeah, |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait a minute, that can't be right because the integral of this from 1 to 3 would be a² integral 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus 0.25*(3-1). Because the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So, the integral would be a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] + 0.25*(2) = a² ln(2) + 0.5. 

But wait, the integral of |ψ|^2 from 1 to3 is 1. So,

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln
