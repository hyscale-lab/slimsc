Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I’m thinking elimination reaction. Since there are two bromides opposite each other on the adamantane structure, maybe an E2 mechanism? Wait, no, E2 is typically for adjacent leaving groups, but in adamantane, the positions are across each other. Hmm. Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Let me visualize the adamantane structure. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three others. So 1 and 3 are not adjacent but on opposite ends. So maybe the base would deprotonate and eliminate both bromides?

Wait, when you have two leaving groups, especially in a structure that's symmetric, elimination might form an alkene. But in this case, elimination of two molecules of HBr would form an allene or perhaps a diene. Wait, but adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So if both Br are eliminated, perhaps the result is a cyclopropane ring? No, wait. Alternatively, eliminating two Br from adjacent carbons would form a double bond, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's an elimination to form a bridge structure.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated separately, but that would form two double bonds. Hmm, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Also, the NMR spectrum of product 1 shows specific peaks. Let me look at that.

The NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), which is probably an OCH2 group. Wait, if KOH is used, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but KOH is a strong base. So perhaps elimination, but the product could be an epoxide? No, wait, an epoxide would form from an elimination reaction. Wait, but how?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. Let me think about possible reactions. Eliminating HBr twice would form a double bond. But the product is a solid. Alternatively, substitution: perhaps it's a di-elimination forming a conjugated diene or an allene. But the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a ketone or ester group.

Wait, but how does that happen? If KOH is involved, perhaps a substitution where each Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group. Oh, wait! It must be a elimination followed by a substitution. Alternatively, maybe the base causes the formation of an oxide.

Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used in an elimination, perhaps it removes HBr twice, forming a double bond. But how does that lead to a carbonyl group? Oh! Wait, maybe it's a neighboring group participation or something else.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -O- group. But then, if two Brs are replaced by O- groups, but where would the oxygen come from? KOH provides OH-.

Wait, if each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would make a diol. However, the IR doesn't show O-H stretches (they usually are broad and around 3300 cm-1), but the given IR is at 1720, which is C=O. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility—could it be that each Br is eliminated, and the structure forms a ketone? No, elimination would form alkenes. Wait, but maybe the reaction is a double substitution.

Wait, maybe it's a substitution, where each Br is replaced by an -O-K+ group, and then upon heating, something happens. Wait, but K is a metal, so maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis scenario. But with two bromides, perhaps forming an epoxide? No, epoxides are from alkenes reacting with peracids.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group. So two -O- groups from KOH would substitute the two Brs, making 1,3-dioxyadamantane? But then, how would that lead to a ketone?

Wait, maybe the KOH isn't just substituting, but causing some kind of rearrangement. Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone, ester, or aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming a bridged structure with a carbonyl group. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. If each Br is on a bridgehead, then eliminating two HBr would form a bridge between them, perhaps leading to a structure with a carbonyl group. Wait, how?

Maybe the elimination results in a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl. Or perhaps, after elimination, the structure forms an allene, and then something else happens. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide. But no, epoxide formation usually involves an alkene and a peracid, not KOH.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 1. It has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. That could be an OCH2 group. Then, 2.41-2.23 (10H) - maybe some CH2 groups around a bridge. 1.94 (2H) could be another OCH2 or a CH2 connected to something.

Wait, the 4.79 (2H) might be an ethereal oxygen, like OCH2CH2O, but that would be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an allyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, in a ketone, the CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would be around 2.1 ppm or so. But the 4.79 is higher, which might be more like an OCH2 group.

But the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is a diketone? But then, where would the OCH2 come in? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a compound where each Br has been replaced by an OR group, but that doesn't directly give a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via some mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination forming a conjugated diene, which then, under basic conditions, forms a diradical or something that rearranges. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH in high heat. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Maybe each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent, so maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are usually not allowed because of Bredt's rule. So maybe that's not happening.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group. So, 1,3-dioxyadamantane would be a diol? But then, the IR would show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product is 1,3-dioxo-adamantane or similar. Wait, but how? Because substituting Br with O would require something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would make a diol. But again, the IR doesn't show O-H.

Wait, another thought. Maybe each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but then the structure rearranges. For example, if each Br is on a bridgehead, substitution would put an oxygen there. But I don't see how that leads to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a diradical, which then forms a carbonyl group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is diepoxy-adamantane? No, that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, considering the IR, perhaps the product is a diketone. So, two ketone groups are formed.

But how does that happen with KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of KOH, the 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr and forming a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, perhaps the elimination is followed by a keto-enol tautomerism? Maybe not.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then under basic conditions, the diol undergoes some kind of cyclization or oxidation. But oxidation would need an oxidizing agent, and KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is heated with KOH, leading to some kind of elimination. If the diol is vicinal (like 1,2-diol), then elimination would form an alkene. But if it's 1,3-diol, perhaps something else happens.

Wait, but the product is a solid, and its NMR shows a 4.79 singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's usually a singlet for two H, but geminal diols are less common.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, maybe the two Brs are eliminated, and a bridge is formed with a carbonyl group. But how?

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen atom, leading to a ketone. But that would require each substitution to be an oxygen insertion, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. Heating with KOH. Maybe it's a double elimination, removing two HBr, forming a bridged structure with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone, but I'm not certain. Adamantanone would have a ketone group on the adamantane structure.

But 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr, would form a bridge with a carbonyl group? Let me think: if 1 and 3 positions lose HBr, perhaps the carbons would bond, but how? If they are on bridgeheads, perhaps a bridge is formed with a double bond, but that's not allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are adjacent on the adamantane structure, so elimination forms a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I don't see the connection.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, abstracting protons and causing the bromides to leave, forming a carbocation, which then undergoes some rearrangement. But in adamantane, the carbocations would be very stable.

Wait, but if each Br is eliminated, maybe the structure becomes more strained, leading to a rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone formed by the loss of two HBr and a ring contraction or expansion. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck on this first step. Maybe I should move forward and see if the next steps can shed light on the first product.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with Lewis acid might cause ring-opening.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol. If it's a diol, heating with a Lewis acid like Al(isoprop)3 might promote some kind of elimination or cyclization.

Wait, product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H), which is a triplet. That suggests two protons adjacent to another group. If it's OCH2CH2O, but that would be a quartet if split by two neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen.

Wait, another thought: The triplet at 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps as part of an ether or ester. Maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong peak, possibly a ketone or ester. So, product 1 is likely a ketone.

So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, undergoes elimination of two equivalents of HBr to form a ketone.

Wait, elimination of two HBr would lead to formation of a carbonyl group in the structure. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require each Br to be replaced by O, but that's not possible directly.

Alternatively, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons that, upon elimination of HBr, form a double bond, but if the structure allows, perhaps it's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, and the structure forms a bridge with a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR again. Product 1 has:

4.79 (2H) – likely a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like O.

2.41-2.23 (10H) – probably CH2 groups in a rigid structure.

1.94 (2H) – perhaps another CH2 adjacent to something.

So, maybe product 1 is a ketone with an OCH2 group attached. For example, a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide with a carbonyl nearby.

Wait, but the IR is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So, it's likely a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, heating with aluminum isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) would do what? Maybe it would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. But in Friedel-Crafts, you need an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and the Lewis acid is used for dehydration. But earlier we thought the IR doesn't show O-H.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. If product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with a Lewis acid would cause ring-opening. But the product after that is product 2, which is used in the next step.

Wait, but product 2 is then treated with ozone. Ozonolysis is typically for alkenes, breaking double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it. But if product 2 is from a Lewis acid treatment of product 1, which was a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or an enol ether.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, ozonolysis would act on any double bonds in product 2.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. For example, the ketone could undergo dehydration to form an alkene if possible. But I thought that usually requires an alpha H.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it has alpha hydrogens. For example, let's say product 1 is something like (CH2)2CO in a more complex structure. Then, using a Lewis acid could abstract a proton alpha to the carbonyl, leading to elimination of water and forming an alkene.

So, product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyl groups, with the number of carbonyls depending on the structure of the alkene.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen (so probably the most downfield) would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. But the question is about the coupling pattern.

So, let's think: if product 3 is a result of ozonolysis, which cleaves the alkene into carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 was a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups. But depending on the substitution, the resulting structure could have different coupling.

Wait, but the exact structure matters. Let me try to outline all the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → heated with KOH → product 1 (a ketone, let's say 1,3-diketone or a single ketone).

2. Product 1 → heated with Al(OiPr)3 → product 2 (maybe an alkene).

3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (carbonyl compounds).

So, in the NMR of product 3, we have to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding exchangeable H).

So, let's say product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Depending on the structure, the adjacent Hs would be split into certain patterns.

Wait, but let's think about the structure of product 2. Suppose product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed by dehydration of the ketone.

For example, if product 1 is (CH2)2CO, then product 2 would be CH2=CHCO.

But in a more complex structure, say, adamantane-based, the elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So, perhaps the elimination forms a double bond elsewhere, not at the bridgehead.

Alternatively, in the adamantane structure, elimination could form a double bond in a more flexible part.

So, product 2 is an alkene adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond. For a simple case, say, R1CH2CH2CO → R1CH2 and R1'CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, ozonolysis of RCH2CH2CO would not be correct. Wait, ozonolysis of RCH2CH2CO would actually not apply. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, product 2 could have a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is CH2=CHCO-R, ozonolysis would break the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups. The splitting would depend on the adjacent H.

Wait, another example: say, product 2 is CH2=CH2. Ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules, but that's a simple case.

But in our case, product 2 is from product 1 (a ketone) treated with a Lewis acid, so probably product 2 is an enone (conjugated enone), like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R' or something similar.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Ozonolysis of such a compound would give diketones or carbonyl compounds.

Wait, when ozonolysis is performed on an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, what's the result? Let me think. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into R-CO and R'-CO.

But wait, if the alkene is between the carbonyl and another group, like CH2=CH-CO-R, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, product 2 could be an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, let me consider that product 2 is an alkene adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, for example, if product 2 is cyclohexene with a ketone substituent, then ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

In such a case, the resulting product would have two carbonyl groups adjacent to each other, but that might not fit the IR data.

Wait, but the NMR of product 3 is what's in question. So, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps in a CH2 group.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring Hs. For example, in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the Hs might be split by adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with a CH2 group next to each ketone. So, each CH2 group would have two Hs, and the coupling would be from neighboring Hs.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a single double bond would typically yield two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, considering the ozonolysis step: when ozone is bubbled through a solution at -78°C, it's usually followed by work-up with something like dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is a reductive work-up, leading to the formation of carbonyl groups without over-oxidizing.

So, if product 2 was a simple alkene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Now, let's think about the structure. If product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, for example, R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, after ozonolysis, it would break into two ketones. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a mono-alkene, and ozonolysis gives a single carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, say, CH2=CH2. Ozonolysis would break it into two formaldehyde molecules, but that's a trivial case and probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, product 2 is a more complex alkene, like CH2=CH-R, where R is a substituent. Ozonolysis would give two carbonyl compounds, perhaps RCHO and another.

Wait, but the exact structure is unclear. However, the key is to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3's NMR.

Assuming product 3 has a structure with a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, each H in that CH2 would be next to another CH2 group. Let's say it's a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO=O.

Wait, but that would mean the central CH2 groups are between two carbonyls. So each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So each H would couple with Hs from neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and perhaps another CH2 group. So, each H would have coupling with two neighboring Hs.

Wait, if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would have two neighboring groups. Each H on the central CH2 would be coupled to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, for example, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the central CH2 group would have each H coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So, each H in the central CH2 would be a triplet of triplets, or maybe a triplet.

Wait, let's model it. Suppose we have two carbonyl groups flanking a -CH2-CH2- group. The Hs on each CH2 would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So, the central CH2 would have each H seeing two Hs from each adjacent group. So, for each H in the central CH2, the coupling would be with two Hs from the next CH2 group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, each with a coupling constant J.

Wait, but each H in a CH2 is split by the adjacent CH2's two Hs. So, each H in the first CH2 would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2's two Hs. Similarly, each H in the second CH2 would be split into a triplet by the first CH2's Hs.

So, the central CH2 groups would each have a triplet coupling pattern. But wait, in the case where the structure is symmetric, maybe the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group, but considering the options, the CH2 is more likely.

Wait, another possibility: if the ozonolysis yields a structure where the H in question is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, then each H would be split by two neighboring Hs. So, each H would be a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the coupling is more complex. Let me think about two adjacent CH2 groups. For example, in a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the Hs on the first CH2 are next to the Hs on the second CH2.

Each H on the first CH2 would be split by two Hs on the second CH2. So, each would be a triplet. Similarly, each H on the second CH2 would be split by two Hs on the first, making another triplet.

Wait, but what about if the groups are more complex. Suppose the structure is such that the deshielded H is part of a CH2 that's next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. So, the H in question has two neighboring Hs (from the adjacent CH2), each with a coupling J.

In that case, each H would be a triplet. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, which would fit this scenario.

Wait, but another scenario: perhaps the deshielded H is part of a CH group, not CH2. But in that case, it would have a different coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, for example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, each H in the middle CH2 would be coupled with four Hs (two from each adjacent CH2 group). That would result in a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two neighboring Hs, each from adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think differently. The question is about the most deshielded H in product 3. The most deshielded H would be near an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl. So, imagine it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO

In that case, each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

So, the central Hs would be split by two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplet coupling? Or a triplet.

Wait, wait. Each H in the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the left and two Hs on the right. So each H would have coupling with four Hs. But that's probably not the case because each H can only couple with neighboring Hs through J coupling, typically only through three bonds.

Wait, no, J coupling is through bonds, typically up to three or four bonds. So, in a -CH2-CH2- situation, each H in the first CH2 would be coupled with the Hs in the adjacent CH2.

So, each H in CH2A would couple with two Hs in CH2B, and vice versa. So, each H in CH2A would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2), and each H in CH2B would also be a triplet.

But if the structure is such that the Hs are in a longer chain, like CH2-CH2-CH2, then each H in the middle CH2 would be coupled with two Hs from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in that case, each H in the middle would have coupling with two Hs on each side, leading to (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the coupling is only with one adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the options include triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and pentet.

If the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be a triplet. So, option A.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group that is next to two other CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H would be split into a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But how to decide which is the case.

Wait, after ozonolysis of product 2, which is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. Let's say product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', which, upon ozonolysis, would cleave into R-CO and R'-CO.

Wait, no, ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone typically gives two carbonyl groups. For example, ozonolysis of R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R' would not split into two carbonyls because the double bond is between CH2 and CH2, not between CO and CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of a simple example: product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond, but in this case, it's a conjugated diene. So ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But perhaps in our case, product 2 is a simple mono-alkene.

Wait, maybe product 2 is an alkene adjacent to a carbonyl group, like CH2=CH-CO-R. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds attached to the same R group.

Wait, but in such a case, the structure would be O=C-R and another O=C-R', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an allyl group attached to a carbonyl. For example, R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O.

Wait, no, perhaps product 2 is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2, which upon ozonolysis would form R-CO and another group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. So, each H in that CH2 would be split by Hs on adjacent groups.

If that CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would be split into a triplet from one side and another triplet from the other side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, each H would only couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H in the central CH2 would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2's two Hs. So, each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is CH2(CO)-CH2-CH2-CO, then the central CH2 would have each H coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H in the central CH2 would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO, then the central CH2 would only be adjacent to one CH2 group on each side, each contributing two Hs. So, each H in the central CH2 would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H in the central CH2 would be coupled with four Hs (two from each side), leading to a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks). But that's option D, a pentet.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each H is only coupled with the adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and another CH group.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a specific example. Let's say product 3 is a diketone with a -CH2- group between two ketones.

So, structure: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

In this case, the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring CH2 groups. But wait, that's not right because the middle would be CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. So, the CH2 groups are each next to a carbonyl group. So, each CH2 group is between two carbonyls.

Wait, no, that would make the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which is a four-carbon chain. The central CH2 groups are each next to another CH2 group and a carbonyl group.

So, each H in the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs from the neighboring CH2 group. Thus, each H would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H would be in the CH2 group next to the carbonyl, and each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group is flanked by carbonyl groups. The Hs on each CH2 group would be adjacent to two Hs on the other CH2.

So, each H in the CH2 would be a triplet.

In that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs from each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, but in our case, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. So, the first CH2 is flanked by O=C and CH2. The second CH2 is flanked by CH2 and C=O.

So, the Hs in the first CH2 are only adjacent to the second CH2's two Hs. So, each H in the first CH2 is a triplet. Similarly for the second CH2.

In that case, the coupling pattern is a triplet.

Thus, the answer would be option A: triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the final answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a double elimination of HBr. This forms a ketone (product 1), as indicated by the IR spectrum showing a strong carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) supports the presence of a ketone with adjacent CH₂ groups.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely promotes further reaction. This step likely forms an α,β-unsaturated ketone (product 2), where the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond. This conjugation is common under Lewis acid catalysis.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis of the α,β-unsaturated ketone cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) is a diketone with a structure such as O=C-R-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum corresponds to the hydrogens on the CH₂ group flanked by carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**:  
   The hydrogens on the CH₂ group adjacent to carbonyl groups are split by the two hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂ group. This results in a triplet coupling pattern for these hydrogens, as each hydrogen is coupled to two equivalent hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group.

Given the coupling pattern and the structure of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen exhibits a **triplet** splitting pattern.

**Answer: A**
