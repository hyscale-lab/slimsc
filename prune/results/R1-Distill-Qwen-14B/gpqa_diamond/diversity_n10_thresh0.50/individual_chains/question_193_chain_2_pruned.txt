Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance, but wait, no, more accurately, the distance in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But wait, since d = 1/plx, plx is proportional to 1/d. So plx = k/d where k is some constant. Let me rewrite that. So plx = 1/d, since d is in parsecs.

So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Because 1/plx is d. So substituting plx from above, 1/plx is d. So N ∝ d^5? Wait, wait, let's see.

Wait no, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx) = d. So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the
