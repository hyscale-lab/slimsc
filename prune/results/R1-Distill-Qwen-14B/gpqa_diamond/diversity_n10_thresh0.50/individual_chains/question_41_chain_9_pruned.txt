Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. The speed of light in the glass when the medium is moving—oh, right, this involves relativistic effects maybe? Or maybe just the regular addition of velocities?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is a bit different. Oh wait, the formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but that's when you're transforming between frames. But wait, in this case, the medium itself is moving. So the speed of light in the medium is normally c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c divided by n.

So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So we need to find the speed of light in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass.

Wait, but velocity addition in relativity is tricky. Let me get the correct approach. If the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light (which is moving towards the observer), then the light's speed in the lab frame would be the glass's speed plus the light's speed in the glass, but adjusted for relativity.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me see. The velocity of the light in the glass's frame is u' = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab frame sees the light's velocity u as (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait: in the glass's frame, what's the direction? The light is moving towards the observer, which is the same direction as the glass's motion. So if the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, then in the glass's frame, the light is moving towards the observer (i.e., in the same direction as the glass's velocity in the lab frame).

Wait, perhaps I should set up the frames properly. Let's say the lab frame is S, and the glass's frame is S'. The S' frame is moving at velocity v relative to S. In S', the light has velocity u' = c/n towards the observer, which is the same direction as S' is moving in S.

So to find u, the velocity of the light in S (lab frame), we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v) / c² )

So substituting u' = c/n, we get:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator:

( (c v)/(n c²) ) = v/(n c )

So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c ) = (n c + v)/(n c )

So putting it all together:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Hmm, let me compute that. So the numerator is (c + n v)/n, and the denominator is (n c + v)/(n c). So when you divide them, it's [(c + n v)/n ] * [n c / (n c + v) ]

The n's cancel out in numerator and denominator. So we're left with (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait: c + n v is the same as n c + v? No, that's not right. Because if you factor out, (c + n v) = n v + c, and denominator is (n c + v). So unless n=1, they're different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait
