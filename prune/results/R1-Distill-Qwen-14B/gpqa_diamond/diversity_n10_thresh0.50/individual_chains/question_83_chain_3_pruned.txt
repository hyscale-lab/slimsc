Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because we're mixing two solutions, so the volume increases, which will dilute the acid.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half of the original concentration because the volume doubles. Oh wait, yeah, because concentration is moles over volume. Since volume doubles, concentration halves.

So initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, volume is 0.04 L, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 mol. Divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's find the equivalence point.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³
