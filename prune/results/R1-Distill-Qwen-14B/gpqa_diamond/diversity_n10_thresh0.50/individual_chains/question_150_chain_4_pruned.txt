Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's an interesting formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, X is 0, N is 1.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2=9/2=4.5? Wait, that doesn't make sense because degrees of unsaturation should be a whole number. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 2*8=16, +2=18. Then minus H: 9, so 18-9=9. Plus N: 1, so 10. Divide by 2: 5. So five degrees. That makes more sense.

Five degrees of unsaturation. Could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is three degrees) and then some double bonds or rings. So perhaps a substituted benzene with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me try to interpret this. The 9.72 ppm as a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm, and if it's a triplet, that suggests coupling with two protons. Hmm, wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or doublets if coupled. But a triplet? Maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde... Wait, maybe that's a conjugated aldehyde with adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but the shift is high, so probably an aldehyde.

Then, looking at the aromatic region. 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each
