Okay, so I've got this question about a new anti-diabetes drug and how to test its effect on mitochondria in HEK293 cells. Hmm, let me think through this. The question is asking which experiment won't help discover the mitochondrial role of the drug. 

The question describes the mitochondria as the cell's energy factories, involved in redox reactions and storing energy between phosphate groups. That energy currency is ATP, right? So the drug might affect mitochondrial function, which could influence ATP production or other related processes.

Looking at the options, each is a different experimental technique. Let's break them down one by one.

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria followed by a glucose uptake assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is used to isolate organelles. If they extract mitochondria and then test glucose uptake, does that make sense? Because mitochondria are involved in cellular respiration, but glucose uptake is usually a function of the cell membrane, specifically in the case of insulin-dependent cells. HEK293 cells are human embryonic kidney cells; I think they don't normally take up glucose as much as other cell types. But if the drug affects glucose uptake, maybe it's acting on the cell surface, not mitochondria. So if this assay shows a change, it might not be due to mitochondrial function. Or wait, maybe the glucose uptake is downstream of mitochondrial energy status? Like, if mitochondria aren't working, the cell can't take up glucose as effectively. Not sure yet, but this option could be a red herring.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Wait, luciferase is an enzyme that emits light when it reacts with luciferin. If they've transformed the cells with this, maybe it's to measure something. Oh, wait, in some cases, like measuring ATP levels. Because luciferase uses ATP to emit light. So if the drug affects mitochondrial ATP production, you would see a change in luminescence. Alternatively, maybe it's not about ATP. But if the cells are transformed, perhaps they have a reporter system. Hmm, but this experiment involves adding luciferin to the supernatant, so maybe it's about secreted enzymes? Not sure. Wait, but the point is whether this experiment would indicate mitochondrial function. If the drug affects mitochondria, ATP levels would drop, so the luminescence would be lower. So this would help assess mitochondrial function. So option B
