Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity formulas.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a relative speed and a total energy. I need to find which one is correct.

First, I think about relative speed. Wait, but in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula. The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference of their speeds divided by that factor.

Wait, but let's think. Let me clarify: if astronaut A is moving at v_A = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v_B = 0.5c, both in the same direction. Then, from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait no, wait. The problem is asking for their relative speed. So if A sees B, or B sees A, the relative speed isn't just 0.1c because of the way relativity works. So I need to apply the velocity addition formula. Let me get the formula right.

The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the frame. Wait, but in this case, if I'm in A's frame, and I want to find B's speed, then u is v_B = 0.5c, and v is v_A = 0.6c. So substituting:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that's ( - 0.1c ) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)).

Simplify denominator: 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c.

The negative sign indicates direction, but since the problem is about speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly because sometimes the formula might have the signs reversed. Let me double-check. Oh wait, if you're moving at velocity v in the original frame and you want to find the velocity of another object moving at u, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but actually, the formula for the relative speed when both are moving in the same direction (A sees B's speed) is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/c²).

Wait, v_A is 0.6c, and v_B is 0.5c. So (0.5c - 0.6c) is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 0.7. So that's -0.1c/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. That would match options C and D for the relative speed.

Now, the total energy part. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, calculate gamma for each astronaut.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D says E=5mc², which is less than what I calculated.

Wait, but wait. Did I calculate the energies correctly?

Wait, let me calculate gamma2 again. 0.5c, so v^2/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. That's correct.

So 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464, yes. 2.5 + 3.464=5.964≈5.96. So option C's energy is correct. So relative speed is 0.14c and energy is about 5.96 mc². So option C is correct.

Let me check the options again:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Yes. So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the problem asks for speed, so the magnitude is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
