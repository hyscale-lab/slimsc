Okay, so I have this physics problem about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm. Let me see. The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame. The glass has an index of refraction n and is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is propagating through it. I remember that when dealing with moving media, especially in relativity, things get a bit tricky. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is usually c/n, right? Because index of refraction n = c/v, so v is the speed in the medium.

But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. Here, the medium is moving. So I think I need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities. Oh right, because velocities don't just add linearly in relativity, especially when the speed is a significant fraction of c.

Wait, but the problem says the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1, so we're probably using units where c=1, so all velocities are in units of c. So v here is a fraction of c.

Hmm. The light is moving through the glass, which is moving. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed from the lab frame.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is (c/n). Because in that frame, the medium is stationary, so the light has speed v_light_medium = c/n.

But because the glass is moving towards the observer, we have to apply the relativistic velocity addition
