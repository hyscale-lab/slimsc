Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and finding the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it should form its conjugate base, acetate ion.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and then dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, first, let me get the details right. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution will be halved because volume doubles. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M?

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, I think I'll need to calculate the equivalence point first. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be 0.001 mol. Because moles of acid = moles of base at equivalence.

So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But the problem asks about two points: 25% titration and equivalence. So 25
