Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, I think. So B is probably a solid at room temperature, but just barely, since 277 K is 4°C. Wait, maybe B is something like water? Because water freezes at 273 K, which is 0°C. So if B's melting point is near 277, maybe it's another compound close to that.

Then there's another clue: the product of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. I'm not sure what that means yet, but I'll keep it in mind.

Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents in organic chemistry... Hmm. Maybe something like a strong base or acid. Wait, maybe it's something like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. Or maybe like NaOH? Or something like H2SO4? Or perhaps KMnO4? Not sure yet.

Let me think about the reaction. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. What liquids react violently with something? Maybe Y is water? Or maybe Y is
