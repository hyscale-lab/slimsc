Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms in the photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, what's the Boltzmann distribution again? Oh right, it's the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state in a system at thermal equilibrium. The formula, I think, is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor.

So the formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote this as Î”E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I think this means that the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is 2 for star_1, and 1 for star_2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm. So maybe the excitation level is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j is 2, and for star_2, it's 1? Or wait, maybe I have it the other way around. No, no, because if star_1 is more excited, then more atoms are in the higher energy level. So n_i is the higher level, n_j is the lower. So (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2, and for star_2, (n_i/n_j)_2 = 1? Or wait, maybe I should think that for star_2, the excitation is lower.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should set it up as:

In star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the question says that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as excited. So I think the ratio for star_1 is higher. So for star_1: n_i (excited) is higher.

Wait, but the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio of n_i/n_j for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 is 1. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the population ratios.

Wait, let me define for each star the ratio r = n_i/n_j. For star_1, r1 = 2, and for star_2, r
