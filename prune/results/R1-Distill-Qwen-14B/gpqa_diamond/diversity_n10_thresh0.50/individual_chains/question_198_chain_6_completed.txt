Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. The options are given, so I guess I need to calculate it using the stability constants provided.

First, let me understand what's going on here. Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate ions (SCN^-). The stability constants (beta) are given for different complexes. The beta values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

So, the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato probably means two SCN^- ligands attached to Co^2+. So, the complexes would be something like [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ with n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, let me think about the possible complexes. If β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2-? Or maybe the charges are different. Wait, Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So, for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), right? Because each SCN contributes one negative charge, and Co is +2. So, for n=1, the charge would be +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But maybe the stability constants are given in order of increasing n. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, which is adding the first SCN. So, the complexes would be [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^-, [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact order, but I think that the beta values decrease as the charge becomes more negative. Wait, looking at the beta values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, β3 is the highest, which would suggest that the third complex is the most stable. But wait, that seems off because the stability usually depends on how many ligands are attached. Alternatively, sometimes higher complexes are more stable, but sometimes the trend isn't straightforward. Well, regardless, the problem gives the beta values, so I'll use them as given.

The problem is asking for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands, so that would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So that's the second complex, right? Because for n=2, that's the complex with two SCN^-.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, the solution has both free Co^2+ and various complexes.

To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), I think I need to calculate the distribution of each species and then find the fraction that is the n=2 complex.

The approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The distribution depends on the concentration of free Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, but how do these stability constants relate to the concentrations? The stability constant (beta) for each complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

For example, for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2], the formation would be:

Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2] ; beta_2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

Similarly for the others.

But wait, all these complexes are formed stepwise, right? Like, each beta is for adding another SCN^- to the previous complex.

So, the general formula for each complex is:

β_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n / [SCN^-]^{n-1} ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each step. For the first complex:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ ; β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

Similarly, the second complex forms from the first:

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ] / ( [ [CoSCN]^+ ][SCN^-] )

And so on.

So, each subsequent beta is for adding another SCN^- to the previous complex.

But when considering all species, the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the complexes and the free Co^2+.

So, the total Co concentration is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} }

We need to find the concentration of each species in terms of [Co^2+], and then express each in terms of the others using the beta constants.

Alternatively, it's often easier to model this using the stepwise formation constants and calculate the fractions.

Let me think about how to model this. The approach is to express each complex in terms of the free Co^2+ and the concentration of SCN^-.

But considering all possible complexes, this can get complicated. Let me see if I can find an expression for the fraction of each complex.

Another approach is to use the sequential formation of complexes. Since each beta is the formation constant for adding another SCN^- to the previous complex.

But perhaps it's easier to set up the expressions for each complex in terms of the free Co^2+ and the total concentration.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the concept of the fraction of each species.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentration of [CoSCN]^+ would be β1 * x * [SCN^-].

Wait, let me think again. The first complex is [CoSCN]^+.

Formation equation: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ ; K1 = β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / (x * [SCN^-] )

So, [CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-]

Similarly, for the second complex:

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; K2 = β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ] / ( [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] )

So, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] 

But [CoSCN]^+ is β1 x [SCN^-], so substituting:

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * (β1 x [SCN^-]) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2

Similarly, the third complex:

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- ; K3 = β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3]^- ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2]^0 * [SCN^-] )

So, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^0 * [SCN^-] 

Substituting [Co(SCN)_2]^0 from before:

= β3 * (β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3

Similarly, the fourth complex:

[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} ; K4 = β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} ] / ( [Co(SCN)_3}^- * [SCN^-] )

So, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3}^- * [SCN^-] 

Substituting:

= β4 * (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 ) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4

So, now, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species:

c_total = x + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3}^- + [Co(SCN)_4}^{2-} 

Substituting each term:

c_total = x + β1 x [S] + β1 β2 x [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4

Where [S] is the concentration of SCN^-.

Wait, [S] is given as 0.1 M. So let's compute each term.

But wait, [S] is 0.1 M, so [S]^n is (0.1)^n.

So, the equation becomes:

c_total = x [ 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 ]

We know c_total is 1e-2 M. So:

x = c_total / [ 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 ]

Let me compute the denominator.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[S] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 [S] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [S]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 

Let me compute that step by step. 9 *40 = 360. 360 *63 = 22680. (0.1)^3 is 0.001. So 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. (0.1)^4 is 0.0001. 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288

So adding all terms:

Term1: 1

Term2: 0.9 → Sum so far: 1.9

Term3: 3.6 → Sum: 5.5

Term4: 22.68 → Sum: 28.18

Term5:36.288 → Sum: 64.468

So denominator is 64.468. Therefore, x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1e-2 is 0.01. 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So x ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [S] = 9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 * 1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β1 β2 x [S]^2 = 9*40 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2.

Wait, let me compute β1 β2 x [S]^2.

9*40=360. 360 *1.551e-4 = 5.5836e-2. Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01 → 5.5836e-4 M.

Wait, 5.5836e-4 M is 5.5836 x10^-4.

Wait, that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3}^- = β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3.

9*40*63=9*2520=22680. 22680 * 1.551e-4 → 22680 *1.551e-4 = ?

Compute 22680 *1e-4 is 2.268. 1.551 is about 1.55, so 2.268 *1.55 ≈ 3.517.

Wait, more accurately: 22680 *1.551e-4 = (22680 *1.551) *1e-4.

Compute 22680 *1.551:

22680 * 1.5 = 34020.

22680 *0.051 ≈ 22680 *0.05 = 1134, 22680 *0.001=22.68 → 1134+22.68=1156.68.

So total is 34020 +1156.68 = 35176.68.

Multiply by 1e-4: 35176.68e-4 = 3.517668.

But wait, that's the product of the betas multiplied by x, but then multiplied by [S]^3 = (0.1)^3=0.001.

So, [Co(SCN)_3}^- = 3.517668 * 0.001 = 0.003517668 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. 362880 * x = 362880 *1.551e-4 → 362880 *1e-4 =36.288, 36.288 *1.551≈?

36.288 *1.5=54.432, 36.288 *0.051≈1.846 → total ≈56.278.

Multiply by [S]^4 = (0.1)^4=0.0001 → 56.278 *0.0001=0.0056278 M.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the exponents in the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute each term step by step.

But perhaps I can now compute the concentration of each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fraction of each complex relative to the total.

Let me see. The fraction f_n of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn ) [S]^n / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

Wait, from the denominator earlier, which was 64.468. So, the denominator is the sum of all terms, including 1 and up to the β4 term.

So, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_n] is (β1 β2 ... βn [S]^n ) / denominator.

Wait, let me calculate each fraction.

For n=0 (free Co^2+), f_0 = 1 / denominator.

For n=1, f_1 = β1 [S] / denominator.

n=2: β1 β2 [S]^2 / denominator.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 / denominator.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 / denominator.

So, the denominator is 64.468 as computed earlier.

Compute each numerator:

n=0: 1 → f0=1 /64.468 ≈ 0.01551 or 1.551%.

n=1: β1 [S]=9*0.1=0.9 → f1=0.9 /64.468≈0.01396 or 1.396%.

n=2: β1 β2 [S]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6 → f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05557 or 5.557%.

n=3: 9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = 22680 *0.001=22.68 → f3=22.68/64.468≈0.35177 or 35.177%.

n=4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288 → f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5627 or 56.27%.

Wait, but wait, adding all these fractions:

0.01551 + 0.01396 ≈ 0.02947.

+0.05557 → 0.08504.

+0.35177 → 0.4368.

+0.5627 → 0.9995.

Hmm, that's about 99.95% of the total. So, the remaining 0.05% is negligible, perhaps due to rounding errors.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So, the fraction is approximately 5.557%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. Hmm, 5.5% isn't any of the options. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the denominator. Let me recheck the denominator.

Denominator = 1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + β1β2β3 [S]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [S]^4.

Plugging the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, [S]=0.1.

Compute each term:

Term1:1

Term2:9 *0.1=0.9 → sum so far:1.9

Term3:9*40*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6 → sum:5.5

Term4:9*40*63*(0.1)^3 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum:5.5 +22.68=28.18

Term5:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum:28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is correct.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468=approx 0.05557 or 5.557%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the stability constants. Perhaps the stability constants are defined differently. Let me double-check the concept of stability constants.

Another possibility is that the stability constants provided are for the overall formation of each complex, not stepwise. Wait, that could change everything.

Wait, if β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc., then each β would be the overall formation constant for that complex.

In that case, the formation would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ; βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

But that's a different approach.

In this scenario, the formation of each complex is a single step, and the beta values are for each respective complex.

But that's not the usual way; typically, stability constants are given for the stepwise addition. But it's possible that the problem defines them as overall constants. Hmm, but the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So perhaps each βn is for the complex with n SCN^-.

So, [Co(SCN)_1] has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2] has β2=40, etc.

If that's the case, then the approach would be different.

In that scenario, each complex is considered in a single formation step.

So, for each complex [Co(SCN)_n], the formation constant is βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

In this case, the total cobalt concentration is sum over n=0 to 4 of [Co(SCN)_n], where [Co(SCN)_0] is [Co^2+] = x.

So, c_total = x + β1 x [S] + β2 x [S]^2 + β3 x [S]^3 + β4 x [S]^4

Wait, but wait, [Co(SCN)_0] is x.

[Co(SCN)_1] = β1 x [S]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 x [S]^2

[Co(SCN)_3] = β3 x [S]^3

[Co(SCN)_4] = β4 x [S]^4

So, total c_total = x (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

Which is the same equation as before. Because in the previous approach, the denominator was the same.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the denominator would be 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

Wait, but in the previous approach, the denominator was 1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + β1β2β3 [S]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [S]^4. So, if the stability constants are stepwise, the denominator is product of the betas up to each term, but if they are overall, the denominator is each beta multiplied by [S]^n and summed.

In this case, the denominator would be 1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Let me compute that.

Term1:1

Term2:9 *0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9

Term3:40 *0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3

Term4:63 *0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363

Term5:16 *0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So denominator is ≈2.3646.

Then, x= (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

Wait, but then the fraction of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn x [S]^n

So, the fraction f_n = (βn [S]^n ) / denominator.

So for n=2, [Co(SCN)_2] =40 x (0.1)^2 =40 x 0.01 x x.

Wait, but x is 4.225e-3.

Wait, wait, no, because the fractions would be:

f_0 = 1 / denominator → 1/2.3646 ≈0.4225 (42.25%)

f_1= β1 [S] / denominator →9*0.1=0.9 → 0.9/2.3646≈0.3806 (38.06%)

f_2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4 → 0.4/2.3646≈0.169 (16.9%)

f_3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063 →0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 (2.66%)

f_4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016 → 0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 (0.0676%)

Adding these fractions: 0.4225 +0.3806=0.8031; +0.169=0.9721; +0.0266=0.9987; +0.000676≈0.9994. So, about 99.94% of the total.

So, the fraction for n=2 is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, wait. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So if each β is the overall stability constant for the complex with n=1, n=2, etc., then the approach of the overall constants applies. Which gives f_2=16.9%, which is option D.

But in my first approach, when I considered the stepwise formation with each beta being the stepwise constant, the fraction was 5.55%, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct approach is the second one, where each βn is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n].

So, the answer would be option D, 16.9%.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the answer.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided: β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co²⁺ and its complexes:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)₂}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)₃}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)₄}^{2-}]
   \]
   Using the stability constants, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of free Co²⁺:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)ₙ}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]
   Substituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation gives:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
   \]

2. **Denominator Calculation**:
   The denominator is computed as:
   \[
   1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting the given values (\( \beta_1 = 9, \beta_2 = 40, \beta_3 = 63, \beta_4 = 16, [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \)):
   \[
   \text{Term 1: } 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Term 2: } \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Term 3: } \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Term 4: } \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063
   \]
   \[
   \text{Term 5: } \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator: } 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of Each Complex**:
   The fraction of each complex is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\text{Denominator}}
   \]
   For [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ (\( n = 2 \)):
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

4. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:
   The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.

ANSWER: D
