Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

First, the problem states that the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons and 4 protons. So I guess the nucleus here is a Li-7 ion. Got it.

So I need to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of this Li-7 nucleus is 0.96c. But wait, energy in particle physics usually refers to kinetic energy or total energy? I think in colliders, the energy refers to the kinetic energy because the rest mass is much smaller compared to the kinetic energy at such high speeds.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let's think. The total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, they often mean the kinetic energy per particle. Or sometimes the total energy. Hmm, I might need to clarify this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which includes the rest mass.

So, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let
