Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking what energy is needed so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6 because the atomic number is 3 (protons) plus 3 neutrons equals 6 total nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases. The energy required is related to their kinetic energy, but I think in this case, the question is about the total energy because when particles are accelerated in colliders, the energy is usually given as the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass energy), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the energy in colliders is typically the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the formula for the total energy (gamma * m c²) includes the rest mass energy. But the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So the question is, which one are we being asked about here? Because the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." So I think they're referring to the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.

Wait, no. In particle physics, when you talk about the energy of particles in a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy that's given. But sometimes, it's the total energy. Hmm. Wait, but wait, the speed is given, so maybe we can compute the gamma factor first and then get the energy from that.

So, the speed v is 0.96c. I need to calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute that.

v = 0.96 c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, subtract from 1 gives 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the mass of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is ^6Li, so its mass is important. I think I need to calculate the rest mass energy of the nucleus and then multiply by gamma to get the total energy, or perhaps the kinetic energy.

Wait, but the energy of the RHIC is the energy imparted to each ion. So in a collider, each beam has particles moving in opposite directions with equal energy. The energy per particle is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think again. The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, let's get the mass of the nucleus. The mass of ^6Li. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately, well, let me think. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for the isotope with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. Wait, no, actually, the standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's a mixture of isotopes. Since we're dealing with Li-6 specifically, perhaps I should look up its exact mass. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to calculate using the mass number. The mass of a nucleus is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon, but we have to consider binding energy. But for the sake of this problem, maybe we can model it as the mass being approximately 6 * m_n, where m_n is the mass of a neutron, but wait, that's not accurate because protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is about 6 * (mass of a proton) or another approximation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the exact mass of the ^6Li nucleus. Let me recall that the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total rest mass energy of the nucleus would be (3 * m_p + 3 * m_n) c². But wait, actually, the exact mass is a bit less than that because of the binding energy. But in this problem, perhaps we can ignore the binding energy and just calculate based on the sum of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the mass of the nucleus as approximately the sum of its nucleons.

Wait, but wait, the binding energy is about a few MeV per nucleus. For the ^6Li nucleus, the binding energy can be found using the mass defect. Let me think about how to calculate that. The mass of ^6Li is less than the sum of the individual masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass defect is the difference, which is the binding energy.

So, m_proton is about 1.007276 atomic mass units (u), and m_neutron is about 1.008665 u. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would sum to 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u.

The mass of ^6Li is 6.015116 u. So the mass defect is 6.047823 - 6.015116 = 0.032707 u. Converting that to energy using E=mc², where 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 0.032707 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = approx 30.45 MeV. So the binding energy is about 30.45 MeV.

But wait, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is (sum of protons and neutrons) minus the binding energy. So perhaps in this case, the actual rest energy is (3 m_p + 3 m_n) c² minus the binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of ^6Li is already known, and I should just use that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just use the atomic mass. Let me think. The mass of ^6Li is 6.015116 u. So converting that to kg, 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6.015116 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈ 9.96e-27 kg.

But wait, perhaps I can just use the rest mass energy in MeV or GeV. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is (mass in u) * 931.5 MeV/u. So 6.015116 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 5610.35 MeV, which is about 5.61035 GeV.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that: 6.015116 * 931.5 ≈ 6.015 * 930 ≈ 6 * 930 = 5580, 0.015 *930=13.95. So total about 5580 +13.95=5593.95 MeV. So about 5.594 GeV.

But wait, the exact value would be more precise. Let me compute 6.015116 * 931.5.

But perhaps I can accept that m c² = 5.594 GeV per nucleus.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should use the exact value. Let me compute 6.015116 * 931.5.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.015116 * 931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315.

0.005116 * 931.5 ≈ 0.005 *931.5=4.6575; 0.000116 *931.5≈ 0.1082. So 4.6575 +0.1082=4.7657.

So 0.015116 *931.5 ≈ 9.315 +4.7657 = 14.0807.

So total is 5589 +14.0807 = 5603.0807 MeV, which is 5.60308 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, going back to the gamma factor. Gamma is about 3.5714.

So the total energy, which is gamma times m c², would be 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3 *5.603 =16.809 GeV. 0.5714 *5.603 ≈ 3.199 GeV. So total is around 16.809 +3.199 =19.008 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's do 3.57142857 *5.603.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603 = approx let's compute 3.5714 *0.6 =2.1428, 3.5714*0.003=0.0107. So total 2.1428+0.0107=2.1535.

Adding that to 17.857 gives 17.857 +2.1535 ≈19.0105 GeV.

So the total energy is about 19.01 GeV.

But wait, the options given are A)18.475 GeV, B)23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419.

Hmm, 19.01 GeV isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the energy being asked is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because in that case, the energy would be (gamma -1) * m c².

Let me compute that. Gamma is approx3.5714, so gamma -1 is 2.5714.

So (gamma -1) * m c² =2.5714 *5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that: 2*5.603=11.206, 0.5714*5.603≈3.199. So total 11.206 +3.199=14.405 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 14.4 GeV, which isn't matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the mass of the nucleus. Let me recheck.

Wait, the mass of ^6Li is 6.015116 u. 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015116 *931.5 MeV= ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.015116 *931.5 = as before, approx 14.08 MeV. So total is 5589 +14.08=5603.08 MeV, which is 5.60308 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon, not the entire nucleus. No, wait, the nucleus is moving as a whole, so the mass would be the mass of the entire nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the mass of a single proton or neutron? That doesn't make sense because the nucleus as a whole is moving.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

v=0.96c.

So beta = v/c=0.96.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta^2 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28≈3.5714.

That's correct.

So the total energy would be gamma * m c² =3.5714 *5.60308 GeV.

Wait, let me compute that precisely.

5.60308 *3.5714.

Let me break it down:

5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.60308 *3.5714.

Compute 0.6*3.5714=2.14284.

0.00308 *3.5714≈0.011005.

So 2.14284 +0.011005=2.153845.

Total energy: 17.857 +2.153845≈19.0108 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.01 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, which is (gamma-1)*m c².

So with gamma=3.5714, gamma-1=2.5714.

2.5714 *5.60308 GeV = ?

Let me compute that:

2 *5.60308 =11.20616.

0.5714 *5.60308.

0.5 *5.60308=2.80154.

0.0714 *5.60308≈0.4014.

So total 2.80154 +0.4014≈3.20294.

So 11.20616 +3.20294=14.4091 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 14.41 GeV, which is still not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider the entire energy per nucleon? No, the nucleus is moving as a whole, so the energy is for the entire nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the mass of a single nucleon, but I don't think so because each nucleon's mass isn't the same as the nucleus. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy per nucleon. But that wouldn't make much sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of ^6Li. Let me check the exact mass.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015116 u. But wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u and a neutron is 1.008665 u. So for ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the sum is 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u. The actual mass is 6.015116 u, so the mass defect is 6.047823 -6.015116=0.032707 u.

Which is about 30.45 MeV as I calculated earlier.

But perhaps the actual rest mass energy of the nucleus is indeed 5.603 GeV as I have.

Hmm, but the calculated total energy is about 19 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, not per nucleus. Wait, no, because the nucleus is moving as a whole, so the energy is for the entire nucleus.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the energy is the total energy per nucleon, so each nucleon is moving at 0.96c, but that doesn't make sense because the entire nucleus is moving at that speed, not individual nucleons.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy per nucleon. But that would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy equation correctly, but I'm missing a factor. Let me think about the units.

Wait, perhaps the mass I should use is the mass of a single nucleon, not the entire nucleus. But wait, that's not correct because the nucleus is moving as a whole. So that approach would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the momentum and use the relation E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)².

But wait, since v = 0.96c, we can compute beta gamma m c² is the total energy, which is the same as gamma m c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum and then find the energy from that. But that would bring me back to the same calculation as before.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the proton, not the neutron, but that would be incorrect because ^6Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass, including electrons. But in a nucleus, the electrons are not part of the nucleus. So the mass of the nucleus is just the sum of protons and neutrons minus binding energy, which as I calculated earlier is about 5.603 GeV.

But maybe the problem is using a different approximation for the mass, such as treating the nucleus as having a mass of 6 * m_p, ignoring the binding energy.

Wait, m_p is about 938.272 MeV/c². So 6 * m_p is 6 *0.938272 GeV=5.629632 GeV.

Hmm, using this approximate mass (5.6296 GeV), let's compute the gamma factor.

Gamma is 3.5714.

So total energy is 3.5714 *5.6296 GeV.

Compute that: 3 *5.6296=16.8888 GeV.

0.5714 *5.6296≈ let's compute 0.5*5.6296=2.8148; 0.0714 *5.6296≈0.4023.

So 2.8148 +0.4023=3.2171 GeV.

Total energy:16.8888 +3.2171=20.1059 GeV.

Ah! That's approximately 20.106 GeV, which matches option C, which is 20.132 GeV. Close enough, considering rounding errors.

So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate the mass of the nucleus as 6 m_p, ignoring the binding energy. That would explain the discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of ^6Li as 6.015116 u and proceed with that. But earlier calculation with that gave about 19 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to treat the nucleus mass as 6 * m_p, leading to an energy of about 20.1 GeV, which is option C.

Wait, but let me compute 3.5714 *5.6296 GeV accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6296:

Breaking it down:

3 *5.6296 =16.8888.

0.5714 *5.6296 = ?

0.5 *5.6296=2.8148.

0.0714 *5.6296≈0.4023.

So total 2.8148 + 0.4023=3.2171.

Adding to 16.8888 gives 20.1059 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, which is close but a bit higher. Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in gamma.

Wait, gamma is 3.57142857 approximately. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6296 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6296.

Let me compute step by step.

3 *5.6296=16.8888.

0.57142857 *5.6296:

Firstly, 0.5 *5.6296=2.8148.

0.07142857 *5.6296= approximately.

Compute 5.6296 *0.07=0.394072.

5.6296 *0.00142857≈0.008044.

So total 0.394072 +0.008044=0.402116.

So total for 0.57142857 *5.6296=2.8148 +0.402116=3.216916 GeV.

So total energy is 16.8888 +3.216916=20.105716 GeV, which is approximately 20.1057 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I should consider more precise values for m_p.

Wait, m_p is 938.272 MeV/c², so 6 *938.272 MeV=5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

Let me compute:

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632= ?

Let me compute 0.57142857 *5.629632:

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632=0.402119.

So total 2.814816 +0.402119=3.216935.

So 3.57142857 *5.629632=16.888896 +3.216935=20.105831 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.1058 GeV, which is 20.1058, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, maybe the actual mass of the nucleus is higher. Let me think: if the nucleus's actual mass is slightly higher than 6 m_p, perhaps that's where the discrepancy is.

Wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.015116 u. So 6.015116 u =6.015116 *931.5 MeV/u= approx 5603.08 MeV=5.60308 GeV.

Wait, earlier calculation with this gave total energy of about 19.01 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the mistake is that I'm not supposed to use the rest mass energy of the entire nucleus but the rest mass of a single nucleon. But that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, but even then, with the nucleus's mass, it's about 14 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula E = gamma m c², but only for a single nucleon. But that would be incorrect because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the energy per nucleon. But then the speed would be the same, and the energy per nucleon would be (gamma m_n c²)/A, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's compute the kinetic energy and then see.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

But perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which is gamma m c².

But in any case, let me recalculate with the exact mass.

With m=5.60308 GeV, gamma=3.5714.

So E =3.5714 *5.60308= ?

3.5714 *5=17.857.

3.5714 *0.60308= let's compute: 3.5714 *0.6=2.14284, 3.5714 *0.00308=0.011005.

Total 2.14284 +0.011005=2.153845.

So 17.857 +2.153845=19.010845 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.01 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the approximate mass of 6 m_p (5.6296 GeV), leading to about 20.1058 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV), but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

Beta=0.96.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the total energy per nucleon. Let's see.

If each nucleus has 6 nucleons, then the energy per nucleon would be 20.1058 GeV /6≈3.35 GeV per nucleon, but I don't think that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula with the rest mass of the entire nucleus, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precise gamma.

Wait, with v=0.96c, the exact gamma can be calculated.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So the total energy with the exact mass is about 19.01 GeV, which isn't an option. But the problem's options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the energy using the mass of a single proton, ignoring the neutrons. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is treated as a particle with mass equal to the mass of a single nucleon. So each nucleon has a mass of about 0.938 GeV. So 6 nucleons would have a mass of 6*0.938=5.628 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.5714, so total energy is 3.5714 *5.628.

3.5714 *5=17.857.

3.5714 *0.628= ?

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.028 *3.5714≈0.100.

So 2.14284 +0.100≈2.24284.

Total is 17.857 +2.24284=20.1 GeV.

Hmm, that's 20.1 GeV, which is option C)20.132 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps the problem is treating each nucleus as having a mass of 6 * m_nucleon (assuming m_nucleon≈0.938 GeV), leading to 5.628 GeV rest mass.

So with gamma=3.5714, the total energy is 3.5714 *5.628= approx 20.1 GeV, which matches option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( ^6\text{Li} \) is \( 0.96c \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Nucleus Identification**: The nucleus \( X \) is \( ^6\text{Li} \), which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a mass number \( A = 6 \).
2. **Relativistic Energy Formula**: The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

3. **Rest Mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \)**: The rest mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \) is approximately \( 6.015116 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:
   \[
   m c^2 = 6.015116 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60308 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

4. **Lorentz Factor \( \gamma \)**: For \( v = 0.96c \), the Lorentz factor is:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
   \]

5. **Total Energy Calculation**: Using the total energy formula:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.60308 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   Breaking this down:
   \[
   3 \times 5.60308 = 16.80924, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.60308 \approx 3.199.
   \]
   Adding these:
   \[
   E \approx 16.80924 + 3.199 = 19.00824 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated energy of \( 19.01 \, \text{GeV} \) does not match any of the given options. To resolve this, we consider an alternative approach where the rest mass of the nucleus is approximated as \( 6 \times m_p \), where \( m_p = 0.938272 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). This gives:
\[
m c^2 = 6 \times 0.938272 = 5.629632 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Using this mass, the total energy becomes:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.629632 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Breaking this down:
\[
3 \times 5.629632 = 16.888896, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.629632 \approx 3.216935.
\]
Adding these:
\[
E \approx 16.888896 + 3.216935 = 20.105831 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Final Match:
The calculated energy of \( 20.1058 \, \text{GeV} \) is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**, considering rounding errors. Thus, the intended answer is likely based on this approximation.

**Answer: C**
