Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The problem says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed. Wait, in classical mechanics, relative speed is just the difference, but at relativistic speeds, I can't do that because of the velocity addition formula. Oh right! I remember that you can't just subtract the velocities directly. Instead, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, does it matter which one is which? Let me think. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the astronaut with higher speed (0.6c) is moving away from the one at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut (moving at 0.5c), the first is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed would be around 0.14c. That's one part done.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I need to compute their energies and add them. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, v=0.6c. Let's compute gamma. v²/c² is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

The second astronaut has mass 3m, v=0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 is approximately 5.964 m c². So the total energy is about
