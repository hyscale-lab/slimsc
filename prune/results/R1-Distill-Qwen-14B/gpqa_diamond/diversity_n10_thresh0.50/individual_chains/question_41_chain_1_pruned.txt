Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, right, when dealing with light and moving media, I remember there's some relativity involved, but maybe it's not too complicated. So, the glass is moving, and the light is inside the glass. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? Because c is the vacuum speed and n is the refractive index. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n.

But here, the glass is moving. So, the observer in the lab is seeing the glass moving towards them. How does that affect the speed of the light?

I think this is a case where we have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Wait, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So, the observer would see the light moving relative to the glass, and then the glass's motion would add to that.

Wait, but the speed of light is always c in all inertial frames, right? But wait, that's when the source is in a different frame. But wait, in this case, the light is inside the moving medium, so maybe the speed of
