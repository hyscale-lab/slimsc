Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they're the standard basis states for the spin-1/2 system.

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So the operator here is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is (hbar/2)(σ_x).

Wait, no, wait—let me think. The Pauli matrices are 2x2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So the matrix would look like:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

So the operator is (hbar/2) times [[0 1],[1 0]], which is (hbar/2) σ_x. Because σ_x is [[0 1],[1 0]].

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates for this operator as well. Because any multiple of the identity matrix would commute with σ_x, so the eigenstates remain the same. So the eigenstates of this operator are the same as those of σ_x.

Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), I think.

But wait, let me get the exact forms right. Yeah, because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so the eigenstates are those superpositions.

So, the operator's eigen
