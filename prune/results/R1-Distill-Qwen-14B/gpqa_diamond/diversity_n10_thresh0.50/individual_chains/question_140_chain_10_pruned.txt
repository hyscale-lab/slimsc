Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 K is about 4°C. That makes me think of something that freezes just above 0, like maybe water, but wait, water freezes at 273 K. Hmm, maybe another compound. Or perhaps something like ammonium nitrate, which has a lower melting point? Or maybe something like camphor? Not sure yet.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the protons. That sounds like a noble gas because noble gases have complete valence shells and their atoms have equal numbers of protons and neutrons for some isotopes. Wait, but not all noble gases. Let's think: Helium has 2 protons, and if it's He-4, it has 2 neutrons. So 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, no, 2 protons and 2 neutrons would make 4 total, so He-4. Then He has equal protons and neutrons as 2 each. So W could be helium. But wait, another possibility: carbon-12 as CO2? No, because CO2 isn't a noble gas. So W is likely helium.

So, the reaction between X and Y produces He gas. What reactions release helium? Maybe a reaction involving metals and acids producing hydrogen gas? Wait, but that's hydrogen. Unless it's something else. Alternatively, maybe a reaction that releases another noble gas, but helium is more common in such reactions? Or perhaps the reaction is a decomposition.

Wait, another thought: if X is a heavier isotope of something. The first line says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is a compound where one element has a heavier isotope. For example, maybe it's something like Cl-35 instead of Cl-37, but wait, no—Cl has multiple isotopes. Or perhaps it's a hydrogen isotope, like deuterium. But wait, deuterium is heavier than protium.

So, when X reacts with liquid Y, which is probably an acid or a
