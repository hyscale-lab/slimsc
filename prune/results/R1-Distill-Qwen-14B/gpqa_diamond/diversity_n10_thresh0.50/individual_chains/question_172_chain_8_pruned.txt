Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means the usual laws of thermodynamics apply there.

I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states in a system to temperature. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. 

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, let me clarify. Are they saying that the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1? Like, [n_i/n_j]_1 = 2 * [n_i/n_j]_2.

So for each star, I can write their ratios:

For star_1: n1_i / n1_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2: n2_i / n2_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

But wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j). Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as star_2." So I think that means the population in the excited state is twice as much. So n1_i is twice n2_i, but both are divided by their own n_j? Not exactly sure, but probably the ratio of excited to lower state is twice for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, let me rephrase. The
