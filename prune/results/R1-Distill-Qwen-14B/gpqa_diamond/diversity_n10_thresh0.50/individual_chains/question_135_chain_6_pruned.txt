Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle decays. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh, I think it's L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) [ῡ + X(y)] ψ_f(y). No, wait, maybe it's more like L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation. Alternatively, the term might be -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, so that's like Yukawa coupling, right? So the interaction is between the scalar X and the fermion ψ_f, with a coupling term λ f. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, X is a boson (probably a scalar since it's a bosonic field), and its decay products would depend on the possible fermion pairs it can couple to. 

So, the decay products would be a pair of fermions and anti-fermions, right? Because in the Lagrangian, the interaction is ψ_f X ψ_f, so X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. But wait, no, because the interaction is ψ_f X ψ_f, but that would be a Yukawa coupling term, which would mediate the interaction between X and the fermion. So, the decay X → ψ ψ-bar would be allowed if the fermion's mass is less than X's mass. 

Wait, but the fermion's mass is given in the problem? No, the problem gives X's mass as 6 GeV. So the fermions that X can decay into must have a mass less than 3 GeV each, because each fermion and anti-fermion would have energy up to the mass of X divided by 2. 

Wait, no, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, each must have a mass less than
