Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about a star with some dark spots and how it affects the observed brightness. The question is asking about the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Wait, the star's radius is equal to the Sun's, right. So Rstar is R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Oh right, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. And the spots are coolerâ€” temperature difference of 1000K. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, so the spots must be 5000K, I think.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes. Photometric observations would show this as periodic dips. But this can look like an exoplanet transit, so the question is, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness.

So the problem is comparing the light curve variations. Without spots, the star's brightness would dip only due to a planet transiting. But with spots, the dip is due to the spots rotating into view, but since spots are darker, the brightness changes.

Wait, no. Wait, when a spot is facing towards us, the star's brightness decreases because that area is cooler. As the star rotates, the spot moves away, so the brightness increases. So over rotational periods, the star's brightness would have a dip and then go back up. But for exoplanets, the dip is when the planet blocks the starlight. So the dip's depth in both cases is what needs to match.

So the key is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the depth of the dip) for both scenarios and set them equal.

Let's break it down.

First, the case with the exoplanet. The depth of the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius. So the fractional brightness change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Now, the case with the star's spots. The total brightness change is due to the spots rotating in and out. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, and the star's rotation would bring spots into view. Wait, but the star is rotating, so when the spot side is facing us, the brightness is lower. The change in brightness would be
