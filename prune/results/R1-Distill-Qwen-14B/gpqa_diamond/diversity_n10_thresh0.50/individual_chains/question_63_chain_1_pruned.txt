Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Let's see what the question says. 

The molecule is made of elements X and Y. Their masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about a photon being absorbed by the molecule in its fundamental state, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. We need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question mentions the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. So if the molecule is in the ground state, what's the next state it can transition to?

Wait, the next state with the lowest energy. Oh, right, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But since the question is about the next possible state, the transition must involve the smallest possible energy change. 

In the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational energy levels are quantized. The energy levels are given by Ev = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is v=0. The next vibrational state would be v=1, which requires a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between v=0 and v=1. Alternatively, for rotation, the energy levels are given by Er = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. The ground state for rotation is J=0. The next possible state would be J=1, which requires a photon with energy E = B(2) since (1)(2) - 0 = 2B.

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon could cause a transition either to the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). Which one requires less energy?

Let me calculate both energy differences and compare.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. Ev = (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = h w. So the energy needed is h w.

Next, the rotational energy. The
