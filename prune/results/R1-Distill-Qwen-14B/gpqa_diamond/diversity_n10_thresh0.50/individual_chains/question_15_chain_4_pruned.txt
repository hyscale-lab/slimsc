Okay, so I have this question about planets and transits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe which one is more likely to transit, and they have limited time. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Specifically, the transit probability is proportional to (Rp / a)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). But wait, wait—no, wait. Actually, I think the probability isn't just that. Let me get this right. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk when viewed edge-on. Or wait, maybe it's more about the relative sizes of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

Oh right, the probability P of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_*/ a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*)), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, that term is negligible. So approximately, P ≈ (R_* / a). Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. For a circular orbit, the probability is roughly (R_
