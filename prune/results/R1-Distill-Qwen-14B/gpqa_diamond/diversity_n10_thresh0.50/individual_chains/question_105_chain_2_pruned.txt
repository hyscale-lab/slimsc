Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and exoplanets causing similar brightness variations. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that an astronomer is observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of the star's surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. Because the star is rotating, these spots will modulate the brightness as they come into and out of view, making the star's light curve vary periodically.

The interesting part is that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet such that it produces the same amplitude in the star's light curve, assuming there were no spots. So, we need to calculate Rpl/Rstar.

First, I need to figure out the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude caused by a planet transiting in front of the star.

I remember that the change in brightness (delta F) when a spot is present is given by the difference in flux from the spotted area and the normal area. The formula for the brightness variation due to spots is:

delta F = (F_spot - F_normal) * (Area_spot / Total Area)

But wait, wait. Let me think about it. Since the spots are cooler, they emit less flux. So when they are on the visible hemisphere, the total flux from the star would decrease, causing a dip in brightness.

Alternatively, the change in flux (delta F) would be negative because the spots are cooler. But when we talk about the amplitude of the variation, it's the absolute value. So perhaps I should compute the relative change.

Wait, another approach. The star's total flux without spots is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F0 minus the flux from the spots plus the flux from the unspotted areas. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Perhaps a better way is to compute the fractional change in flux.

The formula for the fractional change in flux (ΔF/F) is:

ΔF/F = (F_spot - F_normal) * (A_spot / A_star)

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The star's flux without spots is F_normal * A_star. When a spot is present, the flux is F_normal * (A_star - A_spot) + F_spot * A_spot. So the change in flux is (F_normal * (A_star - A_spot) + F_spot * A_spot) - F_normal * A_star = F_normal*(-A_spot) + F_spot*A_spot.

So, ΔF = (F_spot - F_normal) * A_spot.

But the fractional change is ΔF / F_normal = [ (F_spot - F_normal) * (A_spot / A_star) ].

So, the fractional change is (F_spot/F_normal - 1) * (A_spot / A_star).

Since the spots are cooler, F_spot < F_normal, so ΔF is negative, meaning the flux decreases.

So the magnitude of the change is (1 - F_spot/F_normal) multiplied by the area fraction.

Now, the area fraction here is 20% of the hemisphere
