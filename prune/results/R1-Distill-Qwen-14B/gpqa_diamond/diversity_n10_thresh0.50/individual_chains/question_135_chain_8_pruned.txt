Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is about the allowed decay products of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a typo; perhaps it's more like L = -λ (ψ̄_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f), which would make sense for a Yukawa interaction. Oh wait, maybe it's written as L = -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f.

The mass of the X boson is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decay products at the lowest order. So, the possible decay channels are the fermions that X can couple to, based on the Lagrangian.

In such interactions, the boson X would couple to a pair of fermions, right? So, X → f f̄. The possible fermion pairs would depend on the allowed masses. Because for a decay to be allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (since energy and momentum must be conserved).

So first, I need to figure out which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV because X is 6 GeV. Because each fermion would have to be at most 3 GeV (since 2 * 3 =6).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the fermion masses are usually much lower. Let me think about the masses of various fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2-5 MeV (so way less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar, about 4-8 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e⁻): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ⁻): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ⁻): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible, but they are light, but in this case, the problem doesn't mention them, so maybe X doesn't couple to them.

Wait, but the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which probably refers to fermion fields. So the mass terms would involve Yukawa couplings. So, X can only decay into fermions that it couples to. So maybe the fermions in the Lagrangian are the ones that X can interact with.

But wait, the given Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the notation wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as L = -λ (ψ̄_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f), which would be a Yukawa coupling term. That would mean X couples to the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, but in the standard model, the Yukawa interaction is something like L = -λ (ψ̄ (φ + v) ψ ), where φ is the Higgs. So in this case, X is playing the role of the Higgs-like boson. So, the fermions that X couples to would be the ones that have a Yukawa interaction term in the Lagrangian.

So the possible decay products would be any fermion pair (ff̄) that X can couple to, and their mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV each.

Wait, but the X is 6 GeV, so each fermion should be at most 3 GeV. So let's list the fermions and their masses:

Electron (e⁻): ~0.511 MeV → yes, definitely allowed.
Muon (μ⁻): ~105.7 MeV → allowed.
Tau (τ⁻): ~1.78 GeV → allowed, since 1.78 < 3 GeV.

Quarks:

u: 2-5 MeV → yes.
d: 4-8 MeV → yes.
s: ~100 MeV → yes.
c: ~1.3 GeV → yes, because 1.3 <3 GeV.
b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 is more than 3 GeV. Wait, 4.5 GeV is more than half of X's mass (6 GeV). So, 4.5 * 2 =9 GeV, which is more than X's mass. So, X can't decay into b b̄ because each b is 4.5 GeV, and 2*4.5=9>6.

Wait, no, wait
