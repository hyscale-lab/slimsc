Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit back and forth as the planet orbits it.

The problem states that there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars' masses are the same, and the planet masses are the same.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like V*sin(i) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so that formula simplifies a bit. Also, the inclination angle i is the same for both since the orbits are circular (assumed face-on?), so sin(i) is 1 for both. So maybe V is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(something) multiplied by something with the period.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_* is the same for both stars and M_p is similar to Neptune, which is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. So K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/
