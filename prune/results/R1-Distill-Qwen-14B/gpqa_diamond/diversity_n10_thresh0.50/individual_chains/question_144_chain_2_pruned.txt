Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. We’re given its production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances. 

Wait, I remember that particles like mesons decay, and the mean decay length depends on their lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula for mean decay distance is usually something like c multiplied by the lifetime (gamma factor times proper lifetime) multiplied by the velocity. But let me think more clearly.

First, I should probably find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, no, no, wait. The natural linewidth is given by the uncertainty principle: Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Because the width Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in natural units, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm, but I might need to convert units properly. Let me get this straight.

So, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to make sure the units work out. ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me think: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is around 197 MeV·fm, which is 0.197 GeV·fm, and 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. But maybe I should convert Γ into GeV first.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, so that's 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) /
