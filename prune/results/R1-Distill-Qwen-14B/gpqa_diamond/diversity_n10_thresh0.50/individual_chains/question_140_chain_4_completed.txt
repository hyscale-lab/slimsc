Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit puzzled. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is around 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. 

Wait, I remember that 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so B must be a solid at that temperature. What's a solid with a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice? Because water freezes at 273 K, which is 0 degrees, but this is 277, so maybe a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps something like paraffin wax has a higher melting point, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the reaction. X reacts violently with Y to release gas W. Gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Oh wait, that's a key point. So for a molecule, each atom contributes protons and neutrons. But the molecule as a whole has equal numbers of both. Hmm, which gases have that?

Wait, maybe the gas is something like CO2? Let's see: Carbon is atomic number 6, so each C atom has 6 protons and, if it's the isotope, maybe 8 neutrons (like C-14), but wait, the molecule as a whole must have equal protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe it's a molecule made of atoms where the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons for the entire molecule.

Wait, another thought: Nitrogen gas is N2. Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in the most common isotope. So each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that fits—protons equal to neutrons. So gas W could be N2. But wait, when substances react violently, sometimes it's a reaction that produces nitrogen gas. Alternatively, could it be CO2? Let's check: CO2 has one C and two O. Carbon has 6 protons, each O has 8. So for CO2, protons would be 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons would be (6 + (12-6)=6 for C) Wait, no: the number of neutrons per atom is (mass number - protons). So for C-12, 6 neutrons; O-16 has 8 neutrons each. So CO2 has one C-12 and two O-16. So protons: 6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So yes, that would make the molecule have equal protons and neutrons. So CO2 is a candidate for gas W.

So if W is CO2, that would mean that the reaction between X and Y produces carbon dioxide. What reactions produce CO2? Well, perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid. Or maybe a reaction between a metal and a carbonate. Wait, but another possibility: if X is a metal and Y is an acid, they might produce CO2 if the acid is carbonic or something. Hmm, but let's think about the precipitate.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So G is something that upon heating gives B. Let me think about what that could be. If G is a carbonate, heating it might decompose. For example, calcium carbonate on heating can decompose into calcium oxide and CO2, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, heating might not release much. Hmm.

Wait, the melting point of B is about 277 K. Let me think: 277 K is roughly 4°C. So B is a solid at that temperature. What's a solid with a melting point around that? Maybe something like water (ice), but that's 273 K, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps B is some kind of solid compound that's just starting to melt around that area. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that's a byproduct of the reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about X and Y. The problem says that X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X's elements have isotopes, and at least one is heavier than the common isotope.

Also, the product of a certain keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Wait, what's a keto acid? Keto acids are organic, like acetoacetic acid or something. Wait, no, wait: a keto acid is an acid where the carboxylic acid group is attached to a carbon that is part of a ketone group. Like, for example, pyruvic acid is a keto acid. When a keto acid reacts with something, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition?

Wait, another thought: The product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is something simple, like water? Because H2O has two O atoms. Or maybe an oxide ion, but that's more in ionic compounds. Alternatively, if a keto acid reacts with X and releases H2O, that might make sense.

Wait, but wait: the product of the reaction has two oxygen atoms. So the molecule must have two O atoms. So perhaps the product is something like CO2? No, that's three O atoms in the molecule if it's CO2. Wait, CO2 has two O atoms. Oh wait, no: CO2 is one C and two O's, so total of three atoms, but two O atoms. So if the product (from X and a keto acid) is CO2, that would have two O atoms. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but maybe the product is a molecule with two O atoms, like H2O has one O, so that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule, but that's not relevant here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a compound like Na2CO3, but that's not. Alternatively, maybe the product is something like ethylene oxide? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a keto acid and a base. So if X is a base, and the keto acid reacts with it to form a salt and water. So the product would be water. But in that case, water has one O atom, not two. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is something like a carbonate. Or maybe a bicarbonate. Wait, but that may complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a molecule where the keto acid donates an oxygen. Wait, maybe it's something like acetone? No, that's a ketone, not an acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W (CO2), G (precipitate), and maybe some other products. So perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. For example, if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and Y is HCl, they react to produce CO2, NaCl, and water. Wait, but that would produce NaCl and H2O as byproducts. But the precipitate would form only if the product is insoluble. Hmm, perhaps Y is a metal hydroxide, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: The product of X with a keto acid gives a molecule with two O atoms. Let's think about the reaction. Suppose X is a base, and the keto acid is, say, acetoacetic acid. When a base reacts with an acid, it typically forms a salt and water. So the product would be a salt. So for example, if X is NaOH (sodium hydroxide), and the keto acid is CH3COCH2COOH (acetoacetic acid), then the reaction would produce Na salt and water. But the salt would have the formula Na+ and the conjugate base of the keto acid. The conjugate base would have a structure like CH3COCH2COO^-.

But the product of this reaction has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is something like CH3COO^- Na+? No, that's the acetate ion, which has O's, but the molecule (if considering the entire product) would have more than two O's.

Alternatively, maybe the product is something simple, like a carbonate or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about X's properties. The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Oh wait! I remember that sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base used as a reagent in organic reactions. But NaH is Na+ and H^(-), but that's not a metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like sodium metal, but that's not a reagent in the same way. Wait, another thought: maybe X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is a reducing agent. Sodium borohydride is commonly used in organic chemistry to reduce carbonyl groups. So if X is NaBH4, then what?

But let me think about the reaction with Y. If X is NaBH4, and Y is, say, an acid, perhaps H2SO4. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe Y is water, but that's probably not a liquid Y in this context.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. If G is a metal hydroxide, heating it might not release anything. But if G is a carbonate, heating might decompose it into a metal oxide and CO2. But wait, if G is a carbonate, then heating it would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. So B would be the metal oxide. What metal oxides have a melting point around 277 K? Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach: What is the melting point of B? 277 K is about 4°C. So B is a solid at that temperature. Maybe B is a solid oxide. Let me think: what solid has a melting point around there? Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of ice. Wait, water (H2O) freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is just 4°C. So maybe B is a different form of ice or another compound that's solid around that temperature.

Wait, maybe B is sodium oxide (Na2O), but sodium oxide has a melting point of around 1460°C, which is way higher. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like MgO, which also has a high melting point. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe B is actually paraffin wax or some organic solid? No, that's probably not it. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Another thought: if B is solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), but that sublimates at -78°C, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid like ammonium chloride. No, I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the precipitate G could be. If X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce CO2. So when X (like Na2CO3) reacts with HCl (Y), it produces CO2, NaCl, and H2O. But if Y is a solution of something else, maybe Y is a metal hydroxide. Wait, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another angle: The problem says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X contains an element with a heavier isotope. For example, sodium has isotopes like Na-23 (most common) and maybe Na-25. Or maybe chlorine has heavier isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Wait, but let me think about possible substances X. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a common reagent. It contains Na, B, and H. But would that fit the other clues?

Wait, when X reacts with Y, it produces CO2 as gas W. So if X is NaBH4 and Y is something that produces CO2, perhaps Y is a carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like magnesium, and Y is an acid. For example, Mg reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat. But in that case, the gas would be H2, which has 2 H atoms. But the gas W is supposed to have same protons and neutrons, so H2 wouldn't fit because each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't equal, so that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: If X is a carbonate, perhaps sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and Y is an acid like H2SO4. Then the reaction would produce CO2, Na2SO4, and water. But in that case, the precipitate would form only if the product is insoluble. Sodium sulfate is soluble, though, so perhaps Y is a different acid. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite. Let's say X is Na2SO3. Reacting with H2SO4 would produce SO2 gas, but that's not matching the condition for W.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the information again.

- Gas W: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So possible candidates are N2 (each N has 7p and 7n; molecule has 14p and 14n), CO2 (each C has 6p, 8n; each O has 8p, 8n. So CO2 has 6+16=22p and 8+16=24n? Wait, wait no: wait, for each atom, the number of protons is the atomic number, and the number of neutrons is (mass number - atomic number). So, for C-12, 6p, 6n. O-16 has 8p, 8n. So CO2 has (6 + 16) = 22p, and (6 + 16) = 22n. So that fits. So W is CO2.

- So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. So X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. So reaction: Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

In that case, the precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because NaCl is a soluble salt. So perhaps Y is not an acid but a solution that produces an insoluble product.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacts with HCl to produce H2S gas (but that doesn't fit W's condition). Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. But if G is a hydroxide, perhaps heating would dehydrate it to form a metal oxide and water. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a sulfate. For example, if X is BaCO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and CO2 gas. But BaCO3 is not a common compound, perhaps. Alternatively, if X is CaCO3 and Y is H2SO4, producing CaSO4, but CaSO4 is sparingly soluble, so it would form a precipitate. Then, when G (CaSO4) is heated, what happens? I don't think it decomposes easily; perhaps it doesn't release anything, so B might be CaSO4. But the melting point of CaSO4 is about 1450°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the product formed when X reacts with a keto acid. It contains 2 O atoms. Let's say X is NaH (sodium hydride). Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used in organic chemistry to deprotonate compounds. When it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it deprotonates it. So, for example, reacting NaH with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) would produce the conjugate base and water. So the product would be the sodium salt of the keto acid's conjugate base and water. But the product has 2 O atoms. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit because the salt would have more O's.

Alternatively, if X is NaBH4 (sodium borohydride), and it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it reduces the carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps X is acting as a reducing agent, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the isotopes in X. X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps one of its elements has a higher mass isotope. For example, if X is NaCl, and perhaps Cl has a heavier isotope, like Cl-37 instead of Cl-35. But I'm not sure how that would tie in with the rest.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NH4Cl. But again, not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is H2O, which has one O. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's O2, but that's a diatomic gas and would have two atoms but same element.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the options given for the atomic masses. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for example, if X contains elements with atomic numbers 11 (Na) and 1 (H), their masses would be 23 (Na) and 1 (H), summing to 24. But that's not an option. Wait, but perhaps X contains elements with higher masses. Let's think about possible elements in X.

If X is NaBH4, the elements are Na (11), B (5), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option. So perhaps another possibility.

Wait, another possibility: X is LiAlH4. It's a strong reducing agent. Its elements are Li (3), Al (13), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: What if X is something like potassium borohydride, KH2B(OH)2? No, perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH. But NaOH's elements are Na, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Hmm, maybe X is something else. Let's consider the options again. The possible sums of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, so looking at the options:

A) 35: Maybe Cl (35.5) and something else? 35 would be close to Cl-35 (35). So if X has Cl and another element, like Na (23), sum would be 23+35=58, which is not an option. So perhaps that's not it.

B) 25: Maybe Mg (24.3) and something else. Wait, Mg is about 24, so maybe another element with mass 1, like H. 24+1=25. So if X contains Mg and H, their sum would be 25. So option B is 25.

But wait, let's think: If X is MgH2 (magnesium hydride), but I'm not sure if that's a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing Mg and another element.

Alternatively, another combination: 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25. So if X has C and Al, sum 12+13=25. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: If X is NH4Cl. Then the elements are N (14), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which isn't an option. So not this.

Wait, another possibility: If X is something like CsF. Cs has a high atomic mass (around 133), F is about 19. So sum is 152, which is way beyond the options.

Wait, perhaps the sum is for two elements, both present in X. Let me think of elements where their atomic numbers add up to one of the options. For example:

Lightest element: H (1), heaviest: Si (14). Sum is 15. Not in options.

H (1) and Cl (35): sum 36. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: The sum of the atomic masses is in the options. Let's look at the possible pairs.

Option D is 29. So possible pairs could be O (16) and Na (23): 16+23=39. No. Or F (19) and K (39): 58. No.

Wait, perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements are H (1) and something else. Let's see:

Option B is 25: 1 + 24=25. So if X contains H and Mg.

Option D is 29: 1 + 28=29. So if X has H and Si (28). Hmm.

But I'm not making progress on this front.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible substances X and their elements.

If X is NaBH4:

Elements are Na (23), B (11), H (1).

Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

If X is LiAlH4:

Li (7), Al (27), H (1).

Sum is 7 +27=34. Not an option.

If X is something like NaNH2 (sodium amide):

Na (23), N (14), H (1).

Sum is 23 +14=37. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is calcium carbide, CaC2. Ca is about 40, C is 12. Sum 40+12=52. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NaNO2 (sodium nitrite). Elements are Na (23), N (14), O (16). Heaviest is Na (23), lightest N (14). Sum 23+14=37. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule, but that's unlikely since it's reacting as a substance.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but I'm not sure how that fits the other conditions.

Wait, perhaps X is an isotope-rich substance, like deuterated something. For example, if X is H2O with a heavier isotope, like D2O. Then the elements are H (1) and O (16). Sum 17, which is not an option.

Wait, another thought: The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. Suppose the product is something like H2O2. But that's a possibility. H2O2 has two O atoms. So if X is a base that reacts with a keto acid to produce H2O2, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem from another angle. Let's sum up the clues again:

1. X reacts with Y to produce CO2 (if W is CO2), precipitate G, and perhaps other products.

2. G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K.

3. X's product with a keto acid has two O atoms.

4. X has elements with isotopes, particularly a heavier one.

5. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So X is probably a strong base or a reducing agent.

Wait, sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base used in organic reactions. Let's see if that fits.

NaH reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2 gas. But in this problem, the gas is CO2, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, if X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is a reducing agent. It can react with certain acids or other compounds.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The problem says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product molecule has exactly two O atoms. So possibilities: H2O has one O. O2 is diatomic but same element. CO2 has two O's. So perhaps the product is CO2.

Wait, but how would X and a keto acid produce CO2? Maybe through decarboxylation. For example, if X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, leading to the loss of CO2. Hmm, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, another thought: If X is a strong base like NaH, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), then the reaction would deprotonate it to form the conjugate base. But the product would be the sodium salt, which would have more O's than two.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about all the clues again.

So, X is a substance used in organic chemistry, which reacts with Y to produce CO2 (gas W), a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B with melting point ~277 K.

If W is CO2, then the reaction is likely a carbonate reacting with an acid. So X could be a carbonate like Na2CO3.

When Na2CO3 reacts with an acid (Y), it produces CO2, sodium salt, and water. The precipitate G would form if the sodium salt is insoluble. Wait, but NaCl is soluble, so perhaps Y is a different acid.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is Ba(OH)2, and X is CO2, then CO2 + Ba(OH)2 → BaCO3↓ + 2H2O. So in this case, X is CO2, Y is Ba(OH)2. But the reaction in the problem is X reacting with Y. So perhaps X is CO2, Y is Ba(OH)2.

But then, the precipitate G would be BaCO3, which is sparingly soluble. When BaCO3 is heated, it decomposes into BaO and CO2. So B would be BaO. What's the melting point of BaO? I'm not exactly sure, but it's around 2200°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. The reaction is Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that's not fitting the precipitate G condition.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3. Then Na2CO3 + 2AgNO3 → 2NaNO3 + Ag2CO3↓. Ag2CO3 is a white precipitate. Then, when heated, Ag2CO3 decomposes into 2AgO + CO2. So B would be AgO. What's the melting point of AgO? Silver(I) oxide has a melting point of around 1530°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think about the options again. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, if the sum is 25, that would be H (1) and Mg (24). So if X contains Mg and H, their sum is 25. What compound contains Mg and H? MgH2 is magnesium hydride, which is a strong base. It's used as a reducing agent, perhaps in some organic reactions. So X could be MgH2.

MgH2 reacts with acids (like Y) to produce H2 gas. But wait, earlier we thought that W is CO2, so this might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, if X is MgH2, and Y is a solution of something that reacts to form CO2. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the product with a keto acid. If X is MgH2, and it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it deprotonates it, similar to how NaH would. The product would be the conjugate base and water. But the product would have many oxygen atoms, not two.

Wait, maybe the product is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is H2O, which has one O. No, the product must have two O's.

Wait, another possibility: The product is a diethyl ether or something, but that's a stretch.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CaC2 (calcium carbide). It reacts with water to produce acetylene gas (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide. But that doesn't fit the CO2 gas condition.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is something like Na2S. Reacting it with an acid would produce H2S gas, but that doesn't fit the CO2 condition.

I'm getting stuck on the W=CO2 part. Maybe I should consider other gases that fit the condition of equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, another possible gas is CH4. But CH4 has 6p and 8n. 6≠8, so that doesn't fit. How about O2? O2 has 16p and 16n. So O2 is O=O, each O has 8p and 8n. So O2 has 16p and 16n. That fits the condition. So W could be O2.

But wait, when would a reaction produce O2 as a gas? Maybe in the decomposition of a peroxide. For example, 2KClO3 → 2KCl + 3O2↑. But does that fit the other conditions?

Alternatively, if X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, reacting with Y. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y would produce O2. Let me think: for example, if Y is H2O2, and X is a catalyst like MnO2, then decomposition of H2O2 produces O2. But that doesn't fit the condition where the product is a precipitate G.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if the reaction is between a carbonate and a strong acid, but that produces CO2, not O2.

Hmm.

Wait, another possible gas with equal protons and neutrons is N2, as I thought earlier. So W is N2.

So when X reacts with Y, N2 is released. What reactions produce N2? For example, the reduction of nitrates or the decomposition of some compounds. Alternatively, the reaction of metals with strong acids can produce N2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the Haber process produces NH3, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps X is NH4Cl, and Y is a strong base like NaOH. The reaction would produce NH3 gas. But NH3 has 14p and 16n (each N has 7p, 7n; H has 1p, 0n. So molecule: 14p, 14n? Wait, NH3: 1 N (7p,7n) and 3 H (each 1p,0n). So total p=10, n=7. Doesn't fit. So W can't be NH3.

Hmm.

Wait, I'm not making progress on this. Let me think about the options again. The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options. Let's see:

Option C is 31. Possible pairs: O (16) + S (32) =48. No. Or maybe Cl (35) and something else. 35 + something=31? No, that can't be. Alternatively, S (32) and H (1) sum to 33. Not 31.

Option D is 29: maybe O (16) and Na (23), sum 39. No. Or Mg (24) and O (16) sum 40. No. Alternatively, Al (27) and O (16) sum 43. No.

Wait, another possibility: N (14) and Cl (35) sum to 49. Not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is for the same element, like O and O. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: The product of X with a keto acid contains two O atoms. So perhaps the product is a molecule like O2. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is ethylene oxide (O in a three-membered ring), but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate, but that would have more than two O atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. But a ketone has more than two O atoms (like acetone has three O's: two from the carbonyl and one from the structure).

Hmm.

Another angle: Let's think about the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4°C. What substance is solid at that temperature and melts around there? Water is 273 K (0°C). So B could be a form of ice, but that's around 273 K. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound that solidifies near that temperature.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, if X is LiAlH4, the elements are Li (7), Al (27), H (1). So the lightest is H (1), heaviest Al (27). Sum is 28, which isn't an option.

Another option: If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, not an option.

If X is CaO, the elements are Ca (40) and O (16). Sum is 40+16=56, not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing Mg and O. For example, MgO. The elements are Mg (24) and O (16). Sum is 40. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: If X is a diatomic molecule like H2O, but that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Wait, another angle: What about if X is a substance that, when reacted with a keto acid, produces a molecule with two O atoms. For example, maybe the product is acetone (CH3COCH3). But that has three O atoms. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, but that doesn't have two O's either.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diethyl ether (which has one O). No, that's not two.

Hmm.

Another angle: Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. If G is a carbonate, heating might produce CO2 and the metal oxide. So if B is the metal oxide, what's its melting point around 277 K? For example, if G is CaCO3, heating would produce CaO and CO2. CaO's melting point is around 2600°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that dehydrates upon heating. For example, Cu(OH)2 when heated produces CuO and water. CuO has a melting point of around 2300°C.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is not a metal oxide but something else. Maybe it's a solid like paraffin wax, which has a lower melting point. But then, how would that tie into the other parts of the problem?

Another thought: Maybe B is a solid oxide of a metal with a low melting point. For example, perhaps B is lead oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the product of X with a keto acid. Suppose the product is something like H2O2. Then, the product has two O atoms. So X plus a keto acid → H2O2. But how would that reaction work? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent that reduces a keto acid to produce H2O2. But that seems unlikely.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but perhaps I should look at the options again. The correct answer is likely option B) 25, because that would correspond to H (1) and Mg (24) summing to 25. So if X contains Mg and H, perhaps X is MgH2.

So, X is MgH2. When MgH2 reacts with Y, which could be a carbonate or another compound, producing CO2. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but MgH2 is a strong base and would react with water to produce Mg(OH)2 and H2 gas. But earlier, W was thought to be CO2, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing O and Mg. For example, MgO. But I don't see how that would fit.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If X is a substance like NH4Cl, which when heated with a strong base like NaOH produces NH3 and H2O. But that doesn't fit the CO2 condition.

I'm really not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The sum of 25 (option B) would require elements like H and Mg. So if X contains Mg and H, perhaps MgH2, which is used as a reducing agent. So the answer would be B) 25.


The problem involves identifying a substance X that reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and a compound B. The key points are:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons) or N₂ (14 protons, 14 neutrons). CO₂ is more likely based on the reaction conditions.

2. **Precipitate G**: When G is heated, it releases B, a solid with a melting point close to 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be a simple solid like ice (H₂O), though this needs further clarification.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies the product might be a simple molecule like CO₂ or H₂O, though the exact identity is unclear.

4. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, suggesting it contains elements with isotopic variation.

5. **Use in Organic Chemistry**: X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, pointing to compounds like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or magnesium hydride (MgH₂), which are strong reducing agents.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (35)**: Suggests the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is 35. Possible pairs include Cl (35.5) and H (1), but this does not align with the reactivity or product conditions.
  
- **Option B (25)**: Suggests the sum is 25, likely corresponding to H (1) and Mg (24). Magnesium hydride (MgH₂) fits as a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry and contains Mg and H. MgH₂ reacts with acids to produce H₂ gas, but this does not align perfectly with the CO₂ gas condition.

- **Option C (31)**: Suggests the sum is 31, possibly from S (32) and H (1), but this does not fit the reactivity or product conditions.

- **Option D (29)**: Suggests the sum is 29, possibly from O (16) and Na (13), but this does not align with the isotopic or reactivity conditions.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible option is **B (25)**, as it aligns with the presence of Mg and H in a compound like MgH₂, which is a known reagent in organic chemistry. While some details (e.g., the exact nature of W and B) remain unclear, this option best fits the given conditions.
