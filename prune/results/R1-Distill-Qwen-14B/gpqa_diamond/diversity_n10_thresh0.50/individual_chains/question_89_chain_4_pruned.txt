Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through each part.

The first part is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide, it's a 1,3-dihalide. Hmm, does that change things? Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines in positions that are three carbons apart. But if they're on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure, perhaps it's more about the positions. Wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think about the product. KOH, a strong base, would deprotonate and cause elimination. But in this case, maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihalide that upon base treatment forms a cycloalkene or something else.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for
