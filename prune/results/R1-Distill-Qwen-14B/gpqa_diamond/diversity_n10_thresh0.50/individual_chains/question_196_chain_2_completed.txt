Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my studies that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx, right? But this is relativistic, so I need to consider how relativity affects the equations of motion.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. Then the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal, mv_max² = kA², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so that probably changes things.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; you have to include rest mass energy. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, how does this work with the oscillator? I think in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy might be different, or maybe the equations are modified.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is a combination of rest mass energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy. At maximum speed, the oscillator is passing through the equilibrium point, so all the energy should be kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but wait, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator in relativity might be different. Or maybe the approach is similar but with relativistic expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic form of the equation of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator could be something like d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x. Hmm, but how do I relate x and v? Because in SHM, x is related to v through the equation of motion.

Wait, another approach: in SHM, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero (i.e., at the equilibrium point), so all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the total energy would include both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x². So at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the energy might not just be split into kinetic and potential so simply.

Wait, maybe I should think about energy conservation. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy plus potential energy. But wait, in the maximum displacement position (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. Then, as the oscillator moves to x=0, the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic.

So, in the relativistic case, the total energy E must equal the sum of rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. But wait, in the relativistic oscillator, is the potential energy (1/2)kA² as in the classical case? Or is it modified? I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed assuming it's similar to the classical case for the potential energy.

So, at maximum displacement x = A, velocity is zero. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium position x=0, the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma mc², where gamma is at maximum velocity.

Wait, but wait: the total energy at maximum displacement is E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and the rest energy is mc². At the equilibrium position, the energy is all kinetic, but I think kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1) mc². So E = (gamma -1 ) mc² + mc² = gamma mc². So equating the two expressions for E:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let x = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

gamma = 1 + x.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + x)^2.

Take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 ].

Simplify that,

v² = c² [ ( (1 + x)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + x)^2 ) ]

Which is,

v² = c² [ (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) / (1 +x)^2 )

= c² [ (2x + x²) / (1 +x)^2 )

Factor numerator:

x(2 + x) / (1+x)^2.

Hmm, but x is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me plug that back in.

x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ ( (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator inside the brackets:

Numerator: [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ].

Multiply numerator terms:

= [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * ( (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it can be simplified better. Let me compute 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)):

= (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

So,

Numerator becomes (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) )

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / ( (2 m c²)^2 )

Denominator: [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2

= (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2.

Putting together numerator and denominator:

Numerator over denominator:

[ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²)^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2 ) ]

The (2 m c²)^2 terms cancel.

So,

[ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that simplifies further. Let me see if I can factor anything.

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A². Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think again.

From the earlier equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

gamma = 1 + x, where x is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

gamma = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, no: x is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so 1 + x = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

Now, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (2 m c²)/(2 m c² + k A²).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4)/( (2 m c² + k A²)^2 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4/(2 m c² +k A²)^2 ]

= [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 - 4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2

Expand numerator:

(2m c²)^2 + 2*(2m c²)(k A²) + (k A²)^2 -4 m² c^4.

=4 m² c^4 +4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 -4 m² c^4.

The 4m²c^4 terms cancel.

So numerator is 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4.

Factor out k A²:

k A² (4 m c² + k A²).

So,

v²/c² = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² +k A²)^2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) )).

Wait, let me compute that.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Wait, let me compute inside the sqrt.

1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) 

= [ (1 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) + 1 ] / (1 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) )

= [ 2 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) ] / (1 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Option D is sqrt[ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) )^2 ]

Wait, I'm trying to see if any of these options match what I've derived.

Wait, earlier I have:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 ] where x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2.

Which is,

v²/c² = ( (1+x)^2 -1 ) / (1+x)^2 )

= (1 + 2x + x² - 1 ) / (1 + x)^2

= (2x + x²)/(1 + x)^2.

But that's v²/c².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x +x²)/(1 +x)^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 +x )

Hmm, but let's plug in x = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] ) / [ 1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]

= c * sqrt( [ (k A² (2 m c² + k A²/(2 m c² )) ) / (2 m c²) ) ] ) / [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options. Option B is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) )

Let me compute this:

Inside the sqrt:

1 + 1/(1 - a), where a = k A²/(2 m c²).

= [ (1 -a ) + 1 ] / (1 -a )

= (2 - a ) / (1 -a )

Which would make v_max^2/c^2 = (2 - a)/(1 -a ).

But in my earlier derivation, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2.

Hmm, perhaps let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2.

It equals [ (1+a)^2 -1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Which is [1 +2a + a² -1 ]/(1+a)^2 = (2a +a²)/(1 + a )^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2a +a²)/(1 + a )^2.

Which is [a (2 +a)]/(1+a)^2.

Hmm, none of the options seem to directly match this. Let me look again.

Option A:

v_max = c sqrt[ 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) ) ]

Wait, but that denominator inside the fraction is 1 - (k A²)/(2m ), which would be problematic if k A² is much larger than 2m, because then denominator becomes negative, making the fraction negative, so the sqrt could have issues.

Option B:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, same issue if (k A²)/(2 m c² ) >=1, denominator becomes zero or negative.

But perhaps that's unavoidable.

Option D:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Let me compute what's inside the sqrt:

1 - [1/(1 +a)^2 ] where a = k A²/(2 m c²).

Which is [ (1+a)^2 -1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Which is (1 +2a +a² -1 )/(1+a)^2 = (2a + a²)/(1+a)^2.

Wait, that's exactly what I have for v²/c².

Wait, so v²/c² = (2a +a²)/(1+a)^2 = [ a (2 +a) ]/(1 +a )^2.

Which equals [ (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) ( 2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2.

But looking back, option D has v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 ), which is sqrt( (2a +a²)/(1 +a )^2 ), which is exactly what I have for v²/c². So,

v = c * sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1 +a )^2 )

= c * [ sqrt( a(2 +a) ) ] / (1 +a )

But wait, option D's expression is sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ), which is the same as sqrt( (2a +a^2)/(1+a)^2 ), so yes. So, option D gives v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a^2)/(1 +a)^2 ), which is the same as what I have.

Wait, but wait, let me compute:

Option D's expression inside the sqrt is 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Which is [ (1 +a)^2 -1 ] / (1 +a )^2 = (1 + 2a +a² -1 ) / (1+a)^2 = (2a +a²)/(1 +a )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a +a²)/(1 +a )^2 ) = c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a ).

Which is the same as what I found earlier.

So, the correct expression would be option D. So, the answer is D.

Wait, but wait, in my derivation, I assumed that the total energy at maximum displacement is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Is that correct? Because maybe in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't (1/2)k x². I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic case is different. Hmm, that's a point I'm not certain about. But given the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law (F = -kx), I think the potential energy V(x) is still (1/2)k x², just like in the classical case.

So, with that assumption, the earlier steps should hold, leading to the conclusion that option D is the correct answer.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential. The potential energy is given by \( V(A) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) (similar to the classical case). Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

   At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. The total energy is also expressed as:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   Setting the two expressions for \( E \) equal gives:  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + x)^2.
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is consistent with the relativistic energy conservation principles and the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).
