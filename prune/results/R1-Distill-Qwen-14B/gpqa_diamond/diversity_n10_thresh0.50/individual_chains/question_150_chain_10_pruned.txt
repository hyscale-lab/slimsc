Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I'll start by trying to figure out the structure of the starting compound using the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2=(10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean, for example, a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond (another one), and an amine or something else (like an amide maybe? Or another ring?).

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, an aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's adjacent to only one carbon. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton next to an electronegative group, like in an aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing substituent. Another possibility is a vinyl proton adjacent to an aldehyde. Wait, the triplet with 1H—maybe it's a proton alpha to an aldehyde, like in a conjugated system. Or maybe an aromatic proton with two neighboring protons. Wait, 9.72 is a bit high for aromatic, more like an aldehyde. But aldehyde is typically a singlet. So maybe it's an aldehyde with something else. Hmm.

Next, 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted, but each as a doublet. Common when there are two substituents on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, this could be a pair of protons adjacent to substituents on a benzene ring.

6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. If I have two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51, maybe it's a para-substituted ring, but the splitting suggests perhaps coupling across the ring. Or maybe it's a substituent that's causing each set of protons to split into doublets.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. That's interesting. Broad suggests perhaps exchange with something—maybe an -OH proton, but wait, that would be a singlet for a single proton, not 2H. Alternatively, perhaps a conjugated diene system, but the broadness is confusing. Wait, another possibility is that these are protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a vinyl ether or something. Or maybe they're part of an enol structure. Or maybe they're hydroxyl groups, but 2
