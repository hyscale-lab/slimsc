Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct group.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible higher-dimensional operators that respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. Right, because the Standard Model has specific symmetries, and any effective theory should respect those.

So, the Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which is about how fields transform under Lorentz transformations. SMEFT operators must respect that because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh right, because the Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory. So SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant, which implies they are Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. So option 2, Poincare, must also be respected. Wait, but is Poincare symmetry automatically respected because the theory is built from local fields? Or does each operator have to explicitly satisfy Poincare? I think the operators are built from terms that are Poincare-invariant, so yes, they must respect Poincare symmetry.

Then there's CP symmetry. Wait, does SMEFT require all operators to respect CP symmetry? I'm not so sure. I remember that the Standard Model has CP symmetry, but in reality, there are CP violations. SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, right? Like, for example, the CKM matrix in the Standard Model has CP violation, and SMEFT allows higher-dimension operators that might have similar effects. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric, and I think SMEFT must preserve that as well. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially those that are Lorentz-invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, making option 4 a yes.

So going through the options:

- 1. Lorentz: must be
