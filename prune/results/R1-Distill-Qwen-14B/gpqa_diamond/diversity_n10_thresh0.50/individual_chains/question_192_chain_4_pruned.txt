Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges and electric fields. But wait, this is a bit tricky because there's a cavity involved.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, the conductor itself is bigger than the cavity. Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Oh, and l and L are both greater than R because P is outside.

I think the key here is to remember how charges distribute in conductors, especially when there's a cavity. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charges inside the cavity should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Wait, right! The cavity has a charge +q, so the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. But because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

So the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. Now, from a point outside the conductor, like point P, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's because, outside a spherical conductor, the field behaves as if the charge is a point charge at the center. So the field at P would depend on the total charge on the conductor, which is +q, and the distance from the center to P, which is L.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1/(4pi epsilon_0) * q/(L^2), which matches this. But what about the other options? Let's see. Option A has (l - s cos theta) squared in the denominator. That seems like it's based on vector addition, maybe if the charge distribution wasn't spherically symmetric. But since the conductor is spherical, any induced charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves symmetrically
