Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Or wait, what's the exact stoichiometry here? Oh right, the problem says it's a 1:1 stoichiometric complex because it's Ca-EDTA, so each Ca²+ binds one EDTA. 

So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. The equilibrium expression for this would be K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

I'm trying to find [Ca²+]. But I also need to think about the EDTA concentration. Wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. But in solution, EDTA exists in various protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, which probably means that all the EDTA is in the right form (like the Y^4- form) to form the complex. So maybe I don't have to worry about the different species of EDTA. That simplifies things.

So, let's set up the equation. The formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. So:

K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

We know K is 5e10, [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But wait, when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA²- gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So if initially, the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA²-, and assuming some x concentration dissociates, but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Wait, the solution is of the complex, so perhaps the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA²-, and it dissociates into [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-].

Wait, but if it's the only species in solution, then the initial concentrations are: [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both zero. But that can't be right. Hmm, no, wait: when the complex is formed, it's in equilibrium with the ions. So, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, and at equilibrium, some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but let me consider that the complex is the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA. So, let me denote the amount that dissociates as s. Then, [Ca²+] = s, [EDTA^4-] = s, and [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - s. Wait, but because K is so large (5e10), which is a very strong complex, the dissociation s will be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02. That's a common approximation when K is large; the dissociation is minimal.

So, substituting into the K expression:

K ≈ [CaEDTA²-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Which becomes:

5e10 = 0.02 / (s * s )

So,

s² = 0.02 / (5e10 )

Calculating that:

0.02 is 2e-2. So:

s² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2 / 5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 2e-2 divided by 5e10. 2e-2 is 2 * 1e-2, 5e10 is 5 * 1e10. So (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, s squared is 4e-13. Taking square root, s is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is approx 3.16e-7. Wait, because 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2 * 1e-6. No, wait, 1e-13 = (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 4e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * (3.16e-7) ) = approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex is \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Since the dissociation of the complex is very small (due to the large \( K \)), we approximate \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) at equilibrium. Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \( s \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K \approx \frac{0.02}{s^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( s^2 \):

\[
s^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
s^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
s = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
