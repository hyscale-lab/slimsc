Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with compound A in the presence of a catalyst B, and heat with a solvent. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, I remember that pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, and the substituents might be adding to it.

Wait, the product name sounds like it's a bicyclic compound or maybe a ring expansion. Let me think about the structures. 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a four-membered ring, no wait, pyrrolidine is five-membered. So the parent ring is five-membered, and the substituent is at position 3.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the cyclohexylidene group is attached to the pyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (CH₂) maybe? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexene attached via a single carbon, making a bridge?

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be CH₂-Cyclohexene. So the structure is a pyrrolidine with a substituent at position 1 being a cyclohexylidene group attached via a methylene. So the pyrrolidine is having a new substituent that's a cyclohexene ring connected via a CH₂ group
