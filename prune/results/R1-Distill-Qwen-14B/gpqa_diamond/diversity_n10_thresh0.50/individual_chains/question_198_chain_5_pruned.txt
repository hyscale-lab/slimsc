Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt-thiocyanate complexes are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, and beta4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I think the blue complexes are the ones with two SCN- ligands. Because I remember that Co(II) with different numbers of SCN- forms different colored complexes. The dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n- or something like that. So the Co(SCN)_2 complex is blue, I think.

Stability constants (beta) are the formation constants, right? So beta for each complex tells how stable it is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So the higher the beta, the more the complex will form.

So the problem is about finding the distribution of each Co complex in solution. We're supposed to find the percentage that is the dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^- maybe? Or another charge? I'm not entirely sure about the charge, but maybe that's not crucial for the calculation.

Let me think about the possible complexes. The species present would be Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- perhaps? Because the beta values go up to beta4=16, which would be for the tetrathiocyanato complex.

Wait, wait. Each beta is for the nth complex. So beta1 is for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]^+ because Co^2+ + SCN^- â†’ [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2+ + -1 = +1). Beta2 is for the next, [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because each SCN is -1, so two would be -2, plus Co^2+ gives 0 charge. Beta3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^- (because 3*(-1) + 2 = -1). And beta4 would be for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (4*(-1) +2 = -2).

So the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which I think is the dithiocyanato complex. It's the blue one. So I need to find the mole fraction of this species in the solution.

Hmm, to find the distribution of each species, I think we can model this using the formation constants. The approach is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations, then compute the fraction for each.

But wait, the problem is that the solution hasn't reached equilibrium yet, but with these stability constants, we can calculate the distribution.

The general approach is to assume that the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all
