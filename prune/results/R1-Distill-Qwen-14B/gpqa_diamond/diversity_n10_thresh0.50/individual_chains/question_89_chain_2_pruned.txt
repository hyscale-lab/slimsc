Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, elimination reactions can happen, especially if there's heat involved. So probably an E2 mechanism here. The product should be an alkene because elimination of HBr forms a double bond.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Dibromides eliminating to form alkenes... So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules when treated with KOH. Oh right, that's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But where? Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would form 1,3-adamantadiene? Hmm, not sure about the structure, but the product after KOH is product 1.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 was formed from elimination of HBr. Oh wait, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, but that would form an alkene. If the IR shows a
