Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic mechanics. Let's read the question again and try to break it down.

So, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a possible relative speed and energy.

Wait, hold on. Relative speed in relativity is tricky, right? Because you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. I remember that when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²), where u and v are the speeds of the two objects relative to the same frame. But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted using the relativistic formula.

So, the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c, and the second at v = 0.5c. Since they're in the same direction, I guess the relative speed of the second as seen from the first would be (v - u) but wait, no. Wait, the relative velocity formula is (u' - v')/(1 - (u'v')/c
