Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the larger the shift, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main variables here are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula I remember is probably something like the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for K is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exponents. Let me think again. Alternatively, the formula I think is K ≈ ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3))) )? Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps I can find a simpler relationship.

Wait, I remember that when the masses of the planet and star are much smaller, M_p << M_star, so the term can be approximated. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ), but I'm not exactly confident about the exponents.

Alternatively, another approach: The RV signal is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the square root of the period. Wait, no, that's for another method. Maybe it's more accurate to think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the sum of the masses. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the sum is approximately the star's mass.

Wait, but how does that tie into the RV method? The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

I think the formula is K = ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π c))^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P) )^(1/3) ))... Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, let me think of the formula for K. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * π) )^(1/3) * (G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can neglect that term. So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * ( (27 π)^(1/3) ) ?

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P)^{-1/3}. Wait, I'm not quite sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^{2/3} (P)^{1/3} ) ) ) / c, where c is the speed of light. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the proportionality.

Since both stars have the same mass (M) and the planets have the same mass (m), if I compare the two planets, K1 and K2 are proportional to (m / (M^{2/3} P^{1/3} )) ). So K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}.

Wait, but in this problem, the shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So the semi-amplitude K is larger for planet #2 (7 vs
