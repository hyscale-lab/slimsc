Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, but wait, since it's relativistic, we can't just use the classical equations, right? There's gotta be some considerations for special relativity here.

I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is achieved as it passes through the equilibrium point. The potential energy is all converted into kinetic energy at that point. For a classical oscillator, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m), right? So that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so that might change things.

In special relativity, energy isn't just kinetic plus potential. The total energy includes rest mass energy and the kinetic part. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all its energy is potential, and when it's moving through the equilibrium point, all the energy is kinetic. But relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So the total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

When the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So E = γ mc². Setting these equal: γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Dividing both sides by mc², we get γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²). Because γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can set that equal to the expression we just found.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²). Let me let u = v_max, since that's the maximum speed. Squaring both sides, 1/(1 - u²/c²) = [1 + (kA²)/(2m c²)]².

Take reciprocal of both sides: 1 - u²/c² = 1 / [1 + (kA²)/(2m c²)]².

Then, solving for u²/c²: u²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (kA²/(2m c²))]^2.

Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, the denominator on the right is [1 + something], so when I take the reciprocal, it becomes 1/(something + 1)^2.

Wait, maybe I should work this out more carefully. Let me denote (kA²)/(2m c²) as a term, say, a. Then, the equation becomes:

γ = 1 + a.

So, 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Square both sides: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

Multiply both sides by denominator: 1 = (1 + a)^2 (1 - v²/c
