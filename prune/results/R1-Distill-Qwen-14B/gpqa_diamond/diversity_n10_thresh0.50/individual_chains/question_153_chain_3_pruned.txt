Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different products for each part. Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate, which acts as a nucleophile. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, must be the Michael acceptor since it has an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group.

In a Michael addition, the enolate from the donor attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, the enolate would attack the acrylate. When the enolate attacks, it forms a new carbon-carbon bond. So, the product should have the two starting materials connected. 

Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups (OCH3) on the central carbon. When it forms an enolate, the alpha carbon (the one next to the carbonyl) is deprotonated. The enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Wait, the acrylate is E, so the substituents (p-tolyl and methyl) are on opposite sides, but I'm not sure if stereochemistry matters for the product structure.

The product would have the p-tolyl group, the acrylate's carbonyl, and the malonate's groups. Let me draw it out mentally. The acrylate is CH2-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the other end. So, the structure is something like CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) connected via the double bond to the carbonyl. The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the CH2 part (the beta carbon) of the acrylate.

Wait, actually, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl at C2 and the carbonyl at C3. So when the enolate attacks the beta position (C3?), wait no, the beta position in the acrylate would be the CH2, the alpha being the C next to the carbonyl (the C2 in this case).

Wait, no. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with C2 having the p-tolyl group, and
