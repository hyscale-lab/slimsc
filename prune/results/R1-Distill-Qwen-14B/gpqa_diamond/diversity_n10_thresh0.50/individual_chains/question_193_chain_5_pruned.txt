Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/parallax^5. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1 over parallax (p) raised to the fifth power. Mathematically, I think that would be N ∝ 1/p^5.

Wait, but parallax and distance are related. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is p = 1/d, where d is the distance. So as the distance increases, the parallax decreases. So if p is getting smaller, then 1/p^5 would get larger because you're dividing 1 by a smaller number raised to the fifth power. But I need to relate this to the number of stars as a function of distance.

So, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. In other words, if I go from distance r to r + dr, how does the number of stars change? We're looking for the dependence on r, like N ∝ r^something.

Let me try to express parallax in terms of distance. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So substituting that into the equation for N. N is proportional to 1/p^5, so substituting p = 1/d, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, that can't be right because if N increases as d^5, that would mean that as you go further away, there are more stars? That doesn't make intuitive sense. Because in reality, the density of stars in the universe decreases with distance, I think. But maybe in this specific region, the number of stars is increasing with distance, perhaps because the distribution is different. Oh, but wait, the question is about how the number varies, regardless of whether it's more or less.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting. Let me double-check. N ∝ 1/p^5. But p = 1/d, so 1/p = d. So 1/p^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power
