Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator corresponding to a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let's see. The operator is P, and it's for a muon. Muon is like an elementary particle, similar to an electron but heavier, right? But I don't think the type of particle affects the calculation; it's probably just about the operator.

The problem says the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so n is a unit vector in x-z. So, the direction is θ, φ maybe, but since it's in x-z, the angle φ would be 0 or π? No, wait, because x-z plane has phi=0 or phi=π? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the x-y plane is phi=0, and the x-z plane would have phi=... Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0, so any direction in the x-z plane would have a polar angle θ from the z-axis, and phi either 0 or 180 degrees, depending on direction. Or maybe phi can be any angle, but since it's in x-z, the azimuthal angle phi is measured from the x-axis. Wait, no, the standard definition is that phi is the angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then phi would be 0 or π, right? So either pointing along +x or -x or somewhere between, but in the x-z plane. Hmm, but maybe that's not necessary right now.

The operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's composed of components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component is a 2x2 matrix, and they are scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often used for spin operators. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, which are:
σ_x = [[0, 1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So each component of P is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. So P is like the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, scaled by ħ/2.

The operator in question is the vector operator P, which is the sum of P_x, P_y, P_z multiplied by the direction components. Wait, no, wait. When you have a vector operator like P, the operator in the direction of a unit vector n is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

So here, the operator is in the direction of n, which is in the x-z plane. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that? Wait, wait, standard spherical coordinates are usually (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since n is in the x-z plane, that implies that sinθ sinφ must be zero, so phi is 0 or π, so the direction is along x or z, or something in between in the x-z plane.

Wait, so let's say n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. But n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So the operator P·n would be P_x n_x + P_z n_z, because the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, but the question is to find the eigenvector of the operator P for a direction n in the x-z plane, and eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. So the operator is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

I need to find an eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but I think for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of P·n for eigenvalue +ħ/2 are the spin-up states along direction n. So, the eigenvector would be the spin-up state along n.

But I need to compute it.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the components of the operator, I can construct P·n and then find its eigenvectors.

Let me write down P·n.

P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Substituting the given matrices:

= n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which is:

= (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix is:

[ (n_z, n_x) ]
[ (n_x, -n_z) ]

But it's multiplied by ħ/2, but since we're looking for eigenvectors, the scaling by a constant doesn't affect the eigenvectors, just the eigenvalues.

So I can write the matrix as M = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

But since we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, let's set M |v> = (+ħ/2) |v> .

So the matrix M is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix for the direction n.

So to find the eigenvector, we can write (M - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So substituting M:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * (ħ/2) - (ħ/2) I = 0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out (ħ/2), so:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) I = 0.

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), the equation becomes:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - I = 0.

Wait, no, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so M - (ħ/2)I = 0.

So M is (ħ/2)*[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], and (ħ/2)*I is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,1]]. So subtracting them:

(ħ/2)*[[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1]] = 0.

Wait, but this is a matrix equation. The matrix must be singular for non-trivial solutions, so the determinant must be zero.

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's denote the matrix as a = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Then, the equation is a |v> = I |v>, where I is the identity matrix.

Wait, no, because M = (ħ/2) a, and eigenvalue is (ħ/2). So (M - (ħ/2) I) |v> =0 → ( (ħ/2) a - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0 → (a - I) |v> =0.

So (a - I) |v> = 0 → a |v> = I |v>.

Let me write a as [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So we have the matrix equation:

[ [n_z -1, n_x        ]   [v1]   = 0
  [n_x,      -n_z -1 ] ] [v2]

Wait, no. Wait, a - I is [[n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]].

So the equation is:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

Let me write these two equations:

1. (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
2. n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

Hmm. Let's try to solve for v1 and v2.

From equation 1: (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2 → v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

Assuming n_z != 1 (which makes sense because n is a unit vector; n_z can be at most 1, but only if the direction is along +z. So for most cases, n_z is less than 1.)

Let me substitute v1 into equation 2.

Equation 2: n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

Substituting v1 from equation 1:

n_x [ (-n_x v2)/(n_z -1) ) ] + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

Multiply through:

[ -n_x² v2 / (n_z -1) ) ] + [ (-n_z -1) v2 ] = 0.

Factor out v2:

v2 [ -n_x²/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ) ] = 0.

Since v2 can't be zero (unless v1 is zero, which would make it the trivial solution, which isn't valid for eigenvectors), the term in brackets must be zero.

So,

[ -n_x²/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate the denominator:

- n_x² + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0.

Let me compute (-n_z -1)(n_z -1):

= (-n_z)(n_z) + (-n_z)(-1) + (-1)(n_z) + (-1)(-1)
= -n_z² + n_z -n_z +1
= -n_z² + 0 +1
= (1 - n_z² )

So the equation becomes:

- n_x² + (1 - n_z²) ) = 0.

But n_x² + n_z² = 1 (since it's a unit vector in x-z plane).

So 1 - n_z² = n_x².

So plugging that in:

- n_x² + (n_x² ) = 0 → 0=0.

Which is always true. So our substitution is consistent.

Thus, the ratio between v1 and v2 is v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ) ] v2.

But perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of θ, the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, since n is in the x-z plane, we can represent it using θ, the angle from the z-axis, with phi=0 (since it's in the x-z plane, the direction is along x, so maybe phi is 0 or π). Wait, n could be pointing in the x-z plane, so let's say n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ into the ratio:

v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ) ] v2.

Hmm, but cosθ -1 is negative, because cosθ ≤1. So (cosθ -1) = - (1 - cosθ).

So v1 = [ - sinθ / (- (1 - cosθ) ) ] v2 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

v1 = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] v2.

Simplify:

= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] v2.

= [ cot(θ/2) ] v2.

So, v1 = cot(θ/2) v2.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But wait, let me write the components.

Let me set v2 = 1, then v1 = cot(θ/2).

But wait, if θ approaches 0, cosθ approaches 1, so 1 - cosθ approaches 0, which would make v1 approach infinity. But that's not a problem because θ=0 would make n point along +z, and the eigenvector for P_z would be [1; 0] or [0; 1], depending on the eigenvalue.

Wait, let me think about when θ=0. Then n is along +z, so P·n = P_z. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the state [1;0], because P_z |↑z> = (ħ/2)|↑z>.

But according to our previous expression, when θ=0, θ/2=0, so cot(0) is infinity. Hmm, that suggests that our parametrization might have a problem when θ=0. So perhaps I should parameterize it differently, or perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of sin and cos.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the eigenvector as [ a, b ]^T, and find a in terms of b, and then normalize.

Wait, another approach: The spin-up state along direction n is given by the spinor:

|+n> = e^{i φ/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

But wait, when n is in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or π. So for example, if phi=0, then the state would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], possibly multiplied by a phase.

Wait, but for phi=0, the state would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let's see. The general spin-up state along (theta, phi) is:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

So in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi can be 0 or pi, depending on direction. So the state would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options given have some similar forms.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin-up state is a two-component vector, and it's usually a column vector. The given options are in row form, but perhaps that's acceptable.

But wait, we're to find the normalized eigenvector. So it's important to ensure the vector is normalized.

So, for the general spin-up state along n with (theta, phi), the spinor is:

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which is a column vector.

So the components would be (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be the case when phi=0. That's because if phi is zero, the second component is sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonic Y^0_1, but that's for l=1, m=0. Wait, no, spherical harmonics are for angular momentum, but perhaps it's a different context.

Wait, but the options are a bit confusing because some have hbar in them, others don't. Wait, looking at the options:

A) (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar )

Wait, but eigenvectors are not multiplied by hbar. The operator has hbar, but the eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because the eigenvalue is in units of hbar, the operator is in units of hbar, so the eigenvectors are pure numbers (vectors in Hilbert space). So any option with hbar in the components is likely incorrect. So options A and D have hbar, which might be a red herring.

So options B, C, D, and A.

But given that, options A and D are probably wrong because they include hbar in the components, which doesn't make sense for a normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but let me check the original question again. The problem says, "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector? "

Normalized eigenvector would have a norm of 1. So the eigenvectors should be unit vectors.

So option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. The sum of squares would be (2/3) hbar² + (1/3) hbar² = (1) hbar². So the norm is hbar, which is not 1. So unless hbar is 1, which it isn't in this context, option A is not normalized.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

The norm here would be cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) )=1, so that's normalized.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Norm is cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) )=1, so normalized.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Norm is (2/3) hbar² cos²(theta/2) + (1/3) hbar² sin²(theta/2) )= hbar² (2/3 cos²(theta/2) + 1/3 sin²(theta/2) )). Unless hbar is 1, this isn't necessarily 1. So probably not normalized unless it's scaled differently, but I'm not sure. It's possible the option has a mistake, but given that, perhaps D is not normalized.

So the correct eigenvectors would be either option B or C, depending on phi.

Wait, but the direction n is in the x-z plane. So phi is either 0 or pi.

Wait, in the x-z plane, phi is 0 if it's along +x or +z direction. Wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane has y=0. So the direction can be anywhere between x and z, but in this case, phi is the angle in the x-y plane, which for a point in x-z would have phi=0 or phi=pi, depending on whether it's in the positive x or negative x direction.

Wait, maybe I should think about the spinor in terms of the direction. So when n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi. So the spinor components would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

If phi is 0, then the spinor is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

If phi is pi, then it's [ cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is exactly this form. So the eigenvector would be option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, let's think again. The operator P·n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, right? So for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is the spin-up state along direction n.

And for spin-1/2 systems, the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

So the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

But the options given don't have e^{i phi} multiplied by anything except option B.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Which looks more like the spherical harmonic Y^m_l with l=1 and m=0 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. The spherical harmonics Y^m_l (theta, phi) are functions with specific forms. For l=1, m=0: Y_0^1 = sqrt(3/(4pi)) cos(theta).

Hmm, but that's not the same as our spinor components.

But our spinor components are functions of theta/2.

So in option C, the components are as I mentioned: cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) with a possible phase factor.

But option C doesn't have the phase factor e^{i phi}. So if phi is zero, then option C is correct. If phi isn't zero, then it's not.

But the question says the direction is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So phi could be zero or any multiple, but in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, right? Because in the x-z plane, y=0, so phi is the angle measured in the x-y plane, but since y=0, phi is either 0 or pi if we're in the x-z plane.

Wait, no. Actually, in spherical coordinates, phi is measured in the x-y plane. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, phi can be 0 or pi.

Wait, for example, along +x: phi=0, theta=pi/2.

Along +z: phi=0, theta=0.

Along -x: phi=pi, theta=pi/2.

Along -z: phi=0, theta=pi.

Wait, no: for theta=pi (pointing along -z), phi can be anything, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi would be either 0 or pi? Wait, no, for theta=pi, pointing along -z, phi can be any angle because the direction is along -z, which is in all directions of phi, but for a direction in the x-z plane, phi must be 0 or pi? No, that's not correct. Because when theta=pi, the direction is along -z, which is in the x-z plane as well. So for any direction in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the y-component of n is zero. So n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). Wait, no, wait. Wait, spherical coordinates are usually expressed as:

x = r sinθ cosφ
y = r sinθ sinφ
z = r cosθ

Wait, no, that's the standard definition.

So, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then y=0, so sinφ must be zero. So φ must be 0 or π.

So the direction is either in the x-z plane with φ=0 or φ=π.

So when φ=0, n is in the x-z plane, and when φ=pi, it's in the opposite direction, also in x-z plane.

So in the spinor, e^{i phi} would be e^{i 0} = 1 or e^{i pi} = -1.

So for phi=0: spinor is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

For phi=pi: spinor is [ cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ].

But in the options, option C is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So this would correspond to phi=0.

But the question says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector could have any phi, either 0 or pi.

But in that case, the eigenvector would have a phase factor e^{i phi} in the second component. Which is present in option B.

Wait, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Which looks more like a spherical harmonic. Wait, but for l=1, m=0, Y_0^1 is proportional to cos(theta). Hmm.

Hmm, but the spinor components are functions of theta/2, not theta.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about specific examples.

Case 1: n points along +z (theta=0, phi=0).

Then the spin-up state is [1, 0], which is option C when theta=0: cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0.

So option C works.

Case 2: n points along +x (theta=pi/2, phi=0).

Then the spin-up state is [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is option C when theta=pi/2.

So that works.

Case 3: n points along -x (theta=pi/2, phi=pi).

Then the spinor is [ cos(pi/4), e^{i pi} sin(pi/4) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, - sqrt(2)/2 ].

Which would correspond to option C but with a negative sign in the second component.

But in the options, option C is always positive.

So perhaps for any phi, the spinor is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Which is a general form.

Looking at the options, the only one that fits this form is option B, but option B has theta instead of theta/2.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Which would correspond to [cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)].

But that's not the same as the spinor, which is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)].

So option B is not matching.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct option is C, but only for phi=0.

But wait, the question says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector must account for any phi, which would include the phase factor e^{i phi}.

But the options don't have that except option B and C.

Wait, let me look again.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

But the spinor components are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

So none of the options exactly match.

Wait, wait. Looking back at the problem statement, the eigenvector is for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvector is the spin-up state along n.

But in the options, option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) ).

But that would have a norm of sqrt( (2/3 hbar²) + (1/3 hbar²) )= hbar. So unless hbar is 1, this is not normalized. So option D is probably incorrect.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is normalized.

So probably the correct answer is option C.

But wait, let me think again. When n is in the x-z plane, phi can be 0 or pi. So the spinor has the second component as e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

In that case, for phi=pi, the second component is -sin(theta/2). So the spinor is (cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2)).

Which would correspond to an eigenvector pointing in the opposite direction in x-z.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is option C, which only includes the positive phase.

Alternatively, option B includes the phase in the second component, but uses theta instead of theta/2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another way.

Let me construct the matrix P·n and find its eigenvectors.

So, as earlier, P·n is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Let me represent n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but since it's in x-z, phi is 0 or pi. Let's take phi=0 for simplicity. So n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So the matrix becomes (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v> .

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = |v>.

Let |v> = [v1, v2]^T.

So,

cosθ v1 + sinθ v2 = v1,
sinθ v1 - cosθ v2 = v2.

Rewriting:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 =0.

So, from equation 1:

v1 = [ - sinθ v2 ] / (cosθ -1 )

= [ sinθ v2 ] / (1 - cosθ )

As before.

Now, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2).

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

v1 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) v2 ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] v2.

= cot(theta/2) v2.

So, v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T, up to a scalar multiple.

But this isn't normalized. Let's find the normalization factor.

The norm squared is (cot^2(theta/2) + 1 ) = csc^2(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So,

cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which matches option C.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ for an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The goal is to determine the eigenvector of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, where $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Construction**:  
   The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
   \]
   where $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$, and $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and $\vec{n}$ can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

2. **Matrix Form of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$**:  
   Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the matrix form of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
   \]
   where $I$ is the identity matrix. This simplifies to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0.
   \]

4. **Solving for Eigenvector**:  
   From the first row of the matrix equation:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1) v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0,
   \]
   we find:
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
   \]
   Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:
   \[
   v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2.
   \]

5. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is proportional to $[\cot(\theta/2), 1]^T$. To normalize it, we compute the norm:
   \[
   \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \csc(\theta/2).
   \]
   Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
   \[
   |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This is not normalized because the norm involves $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector components.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This corresponds to spherical harmonics but does not match the spinor form for the eigenstate of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the normalized eigenvector derived above.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
