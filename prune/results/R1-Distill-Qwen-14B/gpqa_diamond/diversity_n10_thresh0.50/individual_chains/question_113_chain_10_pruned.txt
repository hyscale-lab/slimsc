Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the molecular formula from these data and choose between the four options provided.

First, let me go through each technique one by one.

Starting with the FTIR. The peak at 3000 cm^-1 is very broad. I remember that broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, a very broad peak could also be from an -OH group in a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Broad peaks in IR can be from either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or from N-H, but the presence of N isn't mentioned here. So probably it's an O-H group. So that suggests the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group, or maybe even an ester or something else where O-H is present.

But looking at the other peaks in FTIR, there are strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, the strong peak at 1700 is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated, or perhaps an aromatic ring with some substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an amide. Wait, but if there's an O-H group, maybe the 1650 is from conjugation with another group.

Wait, let me think. The 1700 could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But if there's a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H, then maybe it's not a carboxylic acid because those usually have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, but sometimes esters or ethers don't have O-H. Wait, no. Esters have an O, but no O-H. So maybe the O-H is from a hydroxyl group, like an alcohol. But if the O-H is present, that would mean the formula includes an -OH group, which would contribute an O.

Wait, but wait. The molecular formula options include O or O2. So if the compound has an O-H, that suggests at least one O. But the IR also has a peak at 1700, which is another O-containing group. So maybe it's an ester, which has both a carbonyl and an O elsewhere. Or a ketone with an alcohol group. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an ester? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the 1650 cm^-1 peak is from a conjugated carbonyl. Like in an aromatic ring, where the carbonyl is conjugated, leading to a lower wavenumber. Or maybe it's an amide, but I don't see any data suggesting N in the compound. So perhaps it's a carbonyl group adjacent to another group
