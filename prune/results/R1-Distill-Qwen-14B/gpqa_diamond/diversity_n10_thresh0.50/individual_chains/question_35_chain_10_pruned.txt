Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay.

Alright, the setup is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, defined as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a matrix given with the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should probably write that matrix down.

Wait, let me think. Matrix S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So substituting c, Ay becomes (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but what's the form of the eigenvalue equation? It's Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue, and φ is the eigenvector (eigenfunction in this case since it's a function, but for a 2x2 matrix, it's just a vector).

So to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me compute the matrix Ay first. Since S is 2x2, and c is a scalar, multiplying them is straightforward. So the matrix Ay would be:

Ay = [ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
     [ (h/(4π)) * i , (
