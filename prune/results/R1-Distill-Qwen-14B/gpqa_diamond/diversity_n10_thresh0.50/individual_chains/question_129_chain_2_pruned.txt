Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's outline the given information:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR shows a peak at 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are four different ketones. So, the final compound E is likely a ketone, given the IR data.

Let me think about each step and the possible structures.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. Typically, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction adds a cyanide group to the carbonyl carbon and a hydroxyl group to the adjacent carbon. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin.

Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, the same would happen. But the IR of A is around 1750 cm^-1, which is more typical for a ketone (since aldehydes usually absorb higher, around 1720, but this can vary based on substitution). So, A is probably a ketone.

So, A is a ketone, B is the cyanohydrin.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.

Cyanohydrins have a structure where the carbonyl becomes a CH(OH)CN group. When such a compound is reduced with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, the C≡N group (cyano) would be reduced. The cyanide group is a nitrile, so reduction would convert it into an amine. But wait, in this case, it's H2 with Pd; nitriles typically reduce to amines when using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or sometimes Pd. Wait, Pd is used for hydrogenation, but in this case, the nitrile would be reduced to an amine. Alternatively, maybe the reduction is more of a hydrogenolysis or something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the hydrogenation reduces the double bond if B has a double bond. Let me think about the structure of B. Since A is a ketone and reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin, B would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent to each other. So, the structure would be something like R-C(OH)-CN, where R is the rest of the molecule.

When that's reduced with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2? But wait, that's not right. Nitriles reduce to amines when hydrogenated. Wait, n
