Okay, I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me see what I can figure out step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. 

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination might happen here. Since it's dibromide, perhaps a double elimination occurs. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, probably undergoes dehydrohalogenation. But since there are two bromines, maybe it forms a diene or something more complex? Or perhaps each Br leaves, but that would need two elimination steps. Alternatively, could it form an epoxide? No, because epoxides form from vicinal dihalides. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; it's 1 and 3 positions, which are separated by one carbon in adamantane. So maybe it's not an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated, but how?

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can undergo elimination to form an alkyne if the two leaving groups are on adjacent carbons. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Brs on carbons that are not adjacent
