Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak at 3000 is broad, which could be from an -OH group. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic C=C stretch. Alternatively, maybe an ester or amide? Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. That suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene group.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for certain fragments. Let me think. The molecular ion could break down into smaller fragments. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, maybe the fragment comes from the ester part. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or something else. Wait, 45 could be CH3OCH2CH3 (like ethoxy group?), but maybe more likely, it's a carbonyl-containing fragment. Another possibility is a ketone or an aldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Now, let's think about the possible formulas given: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

The molecular formula options have different degrees of unsaturation. Let me calculate that. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For C6H12O2:
C=6, H=12, O=2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one Do
