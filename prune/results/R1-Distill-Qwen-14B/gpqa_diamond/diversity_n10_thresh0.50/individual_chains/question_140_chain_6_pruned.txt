Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. That's just above the freezing point of water, so maybe B is something that melts around there. I'm thinking maybe something like ice, but that's 273 K. Wait, 277 is a bit higher, maybe a different compound.

Also, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That suggests that W is a molecule where each atom has equal n and p. Wait, but the molecule itself... Hmm, maybe the molecule is something like H2O, but that's not right. Wait, no, let me think. Wait, the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, perhaps each molecule is made of atoms where each has equal n and p. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, for example, CO2 has... Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps W is water? Let me check. Water is H2O. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each H2O molecule has 2*(1) protons and (8*2) neutrons? No, wait, that's per molecule. Wait, no, the molecule's total protons would be 2 from H and 8 from O, so 10 protons. The neutrons would be from O: 8 each, so 16. No, that's not equal. So H2O doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: gas W is NH3? Let's see. Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if it's the common isotope). H has 1 p, 0 n. So NH3 has 14 p (from N) + 3*(1) =17 p. Neutrons: 7 (from N) + 3*0 =7. So 17 p and 7 n. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe W is CH4? No, that's not likely. Wait, maybe it's another gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of p and n. Like O2 or N2. Let's see: O has 8 p and 8 n, so O2 would have 16 p and 16 n. That matches. So W could be O2 or another diatomic molecule where each atom has equal p and n.

Wait, but O2 is a gas. Another option is O3, but that's not common. Or maybe another element? Let's think about H2: each H has 1 p and 0 n. So H2 has 2 p and 0 n. No, that's not equal. So O2 would have 16 p and 16 n, which fits. So W is O2? Or maybe another molecule where each atom has equal p and n. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, what about CO? C has 6 p and 6 n (for C-12), O has 8 p and 8 n. So CO would have 14 p and 14 n. So each molecule would have 14 p and 14 n. That works too. So W could be CO. But CO is a gas, but is it produced in such a reaction?

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think about the reaction setup. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing W. Precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. So maybe B is a solid, perhaps something like ice, but that's 273 K. Hmm, 277 is about 4Â°C, so maybe it's a different solid, like something else.

Wait, perhaps B is NaOH? No, that's a solid, but its melting point is higher. Or maybe
