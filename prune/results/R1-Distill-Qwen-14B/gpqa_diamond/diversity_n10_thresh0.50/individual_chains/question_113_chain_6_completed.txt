Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on various spectroscopic data. Let me try to go through this step by step.

First, the question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each piece of information one by one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates the presence of either an alcohol (OH) group or maybe an amine, but since the options don't have nitrogen, it's more likely an alcohol. The broad peak usually suggests hydrogen bonding, which happens in OH groups. Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is typically a carbonyl group (C=O), like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C in conjugation). Wait, but aromatic C=C usually shows around 1600 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1650 could be an ester's carbonyl or maybe an acid. But wait, if there are two carbonyl peaks, that's interesting. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like conjugated double bonds.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH₂=CH- groups, so that suggests there's a double bond in the structure, perhaps in an alkene. So the compound has an alkene.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: the fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for (CH₃)₂O, which is 45 (15*3). Wait, no, (CH3)2O is 30 (12*2 + 1*6 +16). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, 45 could be C3H7O, but more likely, it's something else. Alternatively, m/z 45 is often from a fragment like CH₂=CH-O- or similar. Wait, another thought: the molecular ion might be breaking into smaller fragments. For example, if the compound has an ester group (like R-O-CO-O-R?), but wait, esters have a carbonyl and an oxygen. Alternatively, a common fragment is the tropylium ion, which is m/z 91 for benzene rings, but that's not here. Alternatively, maybe it's the acetyl group, which is 43 (C=O plus CH3), but that's 43. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone or another group. Another possibility is that the peak at 45 comes from a CH₂CH₂O group or something else. Let me think. Maybe it's a cleavage of an ester. For example, in an ester, if the oxygen breaks, you can get a carbonyl and an alcohol part. But 45 could be the mass of the carbonyl fragment plus something else. Wait, let me think of possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So the options vary in the number of H and O. The molecular formulas have 6 carbons, varying hydrogens and oxygens.

Let me consider the degrees of unsaturation for each option. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For option A: C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond, or a combination.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring plus a carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(14-10)/2=2. Two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(14-12)/2=1. One DoU.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So each structure must have at least one double bond.

The FTIR has a peak at 1700 (carbonyl), so the compound has a carbonyl group. So each structure should have a carbonyl.

Looking at the options:

Option B is C6H10O. The DoU is 2. If one is a double bond (from vinyl), then the other could be a ring, but where would the carbonyl come from? Wait, if it's C6H10O with a carbonyl, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone. But a cyclic ketone would have C=O, and the formula would be C6H10O. Let's see: for a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone. Structure: (CH2)5CO, which would be C6H10O. So that's possible. But then, if that's the case, the FTIR would have a peak at ~1700 (C=O), which matches. The 1650 peak – wait, maybe from conjugated double bonds? But cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm. Wait, the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so the structure must have a double bond, not just a ketone. So if it's cyclohexenone (a cyclic ketone with a double bond), that would fit. Then C6H10O would fit that structure. So the FTIR would have a peak at ~1700 for the carbonyl and perhaps 1650 for the conjugated double bond (like in cyclohexenone, where the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, leading to lower wavenumber for the carbonyl, but wait, cyclohexenone's carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the conjugated double bond might have a peak around 1650. So that could make sense. Then the broad peak at 3000 would suggest an -OH group, which fits the cyclohexenone structure? Wait, no, cyclohexenone doesn't have an -OH. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, the FTIR has a broad peak around 3000, which is more likely an alcohol (OH) group. So for the structure to have an OH, perhaps it's a diol or a phenol? But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Let me think.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So perhaps a ring and an ester group. For example, methyl cyclohexanoate or something. Alternatively, perhaps an ester with a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So if the structure has both a carbonyl (ester) and a double bond, then the DoU would be 2 (one from the carbonyl, one from the double bond). Wait, but option A has DoU=1. Hmm, that could be a problem. Unless it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which would have a ring and an ester. But that would bring the DoU to two (one ring, one carbonyl). Wait, but the molecular formula is C6H12O2. So a lactone would have a five-membered ring, perhaps. Let me think: a gamma-lactone is a five-membered ring, which would have a ring (DoU=1) and a carbonyl (DoU=1). So total DoU=2, but option A's DoU is (2*6+2-12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So maybe that's not the case.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So it could have a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring plus a carbonyl. With a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the presence of -OH (from the IR) and a carbonyl (from IR) could suggest an ester. Esters have both oxygen in the carbonyl and an ether-like linkage. So if it's an ester and a double bond, that would account for two DoU. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in NMR would fit.

So, putting it together: Let's think about an ester with a double bond. Such as methyl vinyl something? Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ester, but that would likely have more substituents and possibly different IR peaks, like aromatic C=C around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. The IR here has 1700 and 1650, so maybe an ester (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650). So that makes sense.

Now, the mass spec has a peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what that could be. If the compound is an ester with a double bond, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of an acetyl group or something. Alternatively, the fragment could be from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, if an ester breaks down into an acid and an alcohol, their fragments could appear. Alternatively, the fragment could be from the double bond. 

Wait, 45 is a familiar mass. Let me think: the molecular weight of C3H7O would be (3*12) + (7*1) +16 = 36 +7 +16=60. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, (CH3)2CO is 58. Hmm, but 45 is... Let me see, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, but that's 45? Wait, (CH3)2O is (2*(15)) +16= 30+16=46. Oh, wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2=CH-O group. The mass of CH2=CH-O would be (12*2) + (4) +16=24+4+16=44. But 44 is close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2=CH-O plus something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a methyl ester cleavage. For example, if an ester R-O-CO-O-R' is cleaved, perhaps losing the R-O group as a fragment. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the fragment at m/z 45 could come from a ketene ion (like (CH2)2C=O, which is 44), but that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let me think about the possible structures based on the options and see which would give a fragment of 45.

Option C is C6H10O2. Suppose it's an ester with a double bond, like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate or something. Alternatively, perhaps a substituted ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, let's consider what could give a fragment of 45. For example, if the molecular ion loses a fragment of m/z 45, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, the base peak is at 45, which is a significant fragment.

Wait, another thought: in mass spectrometry, the most common fragment is the molecular ion losing a small group. For example, if the compound is an ester, it might lose the R group as a fragment. For example, in an ester R-O-CO-O-R', upon cleavage, you could lose an R' group. Wait, but I'm not exactly clear on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acylium ion. But I'm getting stuck here.

Let me go back to the other data. The FTIR has a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, which suggests an -OH group. So the compound must have an alcohol group. Wait, but in the options, which ones have an -OH?

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Could it be a diol ester? Or maybe a glycolic ester? Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with an -OH elsewhere, but that might not fit.

Option B: C6H10O. Could have an -OH group, but earlier I thought maybe it's a cyclohexenone without an -OH, but the IR says it's an OH.

Wait, no. If the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is consistent with an -OH, then the structure must have an -OH group. So looking back, which options have structures that include an -OH?

Wait, if the -OH is present, then the formula must have at least one O for it, but some options have more O's.

Wait, all the options have O in them. So, which structures have an -OH group?

Option B: C6H10O. Maybe a phenol derivative? But with 6 carbons, if it's a phenol, like phenol with some substituents? But phenol is C6H5OH, which is C6H6O. But option B is C6H10O, which has more hydrogen. Hmm, perhaps it's a diol, but then the DoU would be 2, which matches. But then, what about the carbonyl? So, if it's a diol with a carbonyl group, that would make sense. Like a cyclic hemiacetal or something.

Alternatively, let's think about each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possibility: ester with an -OH group. Hmm, but that's tricky because esters are O-containing, but an -OH would require an additional O. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. If it's an ester, like R-O-CO-R', then the ester contributes two O's. So if the compound is an ester with an -OH group, that would require three O's. But the formula is O2, so that doesn't fit. So maybe it's not an ester.

Alternatively, could it be a hemiacetal or something else? Not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. If it's a diol with a carbonyl group, like a cyclic ketone diol? Hmm, not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could this be a diol ester? Or an ester with an -OH group? Hmm, but if it's an ester, O2 comes from the ester group. If there's an -OH, that suggests another O, making O3. But the formula is O2, so that's conflicting. Wait, unless... Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with an adjacent -OH group, but that would require another O, which the formula doesn't have. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait a minute, perhaps the IR's broad peak is from an alcohol (O-H stretch), and the two carbonyls in the IR are due to two different carbonyl groups. But that would mean two C=O groups, which would require two O's. So the formula should have O2 or more.

Looking at the options, A and C have O2.

Option A: C6H12O2. So two O's. If it has two carbonyl groups, that would require two O's. Hmm, but two carbonyls would imply higher DoU.

Wait, but the FTIR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Could these be two different carbonyls? Like an ester and a ketone? But that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. But then, the 1650 could be conjugated double bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated carbonyl. Or perhaps one is an ester and the other is a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but what if the compound is an aromatic ester? Like methyl salicylate or something. Let's see: methyl salicylate is C8H8O3, which doesn't match any option here. So perhaps not.

Another approach: the presence of vinyl hydrogens implies a double bond, so the structure must have that.

Let me think about option C: C6H10O2.

DoU is 2. So it can have a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a carbonyl and a ring.

If it has a carbonyl and a double bond, that would fit the IR (carbonyl at 1700 and maybe conjugated double bond at 1650).

The -OH in the IR would mean that this compound has an -OH group, so O2 is possible if the structure is an ester with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but O2 implies two O's. Let's think: an ester has O2, and an -OH would require another O. So that would make O3, but the formula is O2. So that's impossible. So maybe the structure is not an ester.

Alternative idea: the compound has a ketone group and an -OH. So the formula would have O2. Let me see:

A ketone (O) and an -OH (O) would require O2. So the formula would have O2. So that's possible. So for example, a cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group attached. So cyclohexenol? Or something like that.

Wait, cyclohexenone has C=O and a ring, but DoU is 2 (one from ring, one from C=O). But if it has a double bond elsewhere, that would add another DoU. Hmm, but option C has DoU=2. So that would require only two DoU. So perhaps, a cyclohexenol (ring, C=O, and a double bond?) No, that would be three DoU.

Wait, maybe it's a dihydroxy ketone? No, that would introduce more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. Wait, cyclic esters (lactones) have a ring and a carbonyl, so DoU is 2. If the compound also has a double bond, that would increase DoU to 3, which doesn't fit option C's DoU of 2. So that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another angle.

The mass spec fragment at m/z=45. Let me think of possible structures that would result in a fragment of 45. 45 is 45 g/mol. So let's calculate what could have a molecular weight of 45.

Possible fragments:

- C3H7O: (3*12)+(7)+(16)=36+7+16=60. No.
- C2H5O2: (24)+(10)+(32)=66. No.
- C3H5O: (36)+(5)+(16)=57. No.
- CH2=CH-O: (12*2)+(4)+(16)=24+4+16=44. Close but not 45.
Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 44. Still not 45.

Wait, what about C2H3O2? That's (24)+(3)+(32)=59. No. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be CH2=CHOH, which is (30) + (5) + (16) = 51. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me think of another angle. Let's consider each possible formula and see what their molecular weight is, and what possible fragments they could produce.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So the molecular ion would be at 116, but the fragment is at 45.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight: (72)+(10)+(16)=98. So fragment at 45 would be possible if it loses a 53 fragment, but 45 is a possible fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW: (72)+(10)+(32)=114. So possible fragment at 45.

Option D: C6H12O. MW: (72)+(12)+(16)=100. So fragment at 45 could be a part of it.

But how to connect this.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the methyl group from an ester.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a diol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with something else. But wait, a lactone would have O2. Suppose it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring lactone with a double bond elsewhere. But the DoU would be 2 (ring + double bond), which fits option A's DoU of 1? Wait, no. Earlier calculation for option A's DoU was 1, which is (2*6+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. But a ring and a double bond would be two DoU. So that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps option A isn't the right choice.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond. If it's an ester with a double bond, then the ester group (O2) is present, and the ring and double bond would account for DoU=2. Alternatively, maybe it's a furan derivative with an ester group or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a carbonyl and an alcohol suggests maybe a hemiacetal or acetal, but that usually involves more O's.

Alternatively, if the compound is an aldehyde with an alcohol group, but aldehyde's DoU would be high.

Wait, maybe the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ester. For example, something like CH2CH(OH)COOR. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the compound has a double bond. So in the structure, there's a CH2=CH- group or similar.

Putting it all together:

IR: -OH (broad), C=O (1700), possibly another C=C (1650).

NMR: vinyl H's.

Mass: fragment at 45.

So, let me think of possible structures.

An ester with a double bond: Suppose it's methyl vinyl something. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, but the formula for methyl acrylate is C4H6O2. The options are all C6, so maybe a di-ester or a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is cyclohexene with an ester group attached. Like cyclohexene with an ester substituent, making the formula C6H10O2. Because cyclohexene is C6H10, so adding an ester group (O2) would make it C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10, and adding an ester group (like OCOOR) would add two O's and maybe a couple of H's. Wait, no, let me think. If it's cyclohexene with an ester substituent, the formula would be C6H10O2. Because the ester group is O2, and the ring has a double bond. So let's see:

Structure: O

       ||
O-C-O-R attached to cyclohexene.

Wait, but that would make the formula C6H10O2, right? Because cyclohexene is C6H10, and the ester adds O2 without adding H's (if the substituent replaces a H). So that would fit option C.

In that case, the FTIR would show the C=O of the ester (~1700 cm⁻¹), the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene (~1650 cm⁻¹), and the broad peak from an -OH group, but wait, in this structure, where's the -OH? Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester or something with an -OH group.

Wait, another idea: maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring lactone with a double bond. Wait, but a lactone has a ring (DoU=1) and a carbonyl (DoU=1). If there's a double bond, that's another DoU, making total 3. But option C has DoU=2, so that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe the structure isn't an ester but a ketone with a vinyl group and an -OH. So the formula would be C6H10O.

Wait, option B is C6H10O. DoU=2. So a ring plus a double bond, or a ketone plus a double bond. If it's a cyclohexenol (a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group), that would have a DoU of 1 (ring) and the double bond, making DoU=2. Then the FTIR would have the C=O? No, because cyclohexenol doesn't have a C=O. Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Wait a minute, I must have made a mistake. The FTIR shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So if the structure has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, then there must be C=O.

So, back to the options, the compound must have a carbonyl group. So the structure must have O2? Because the carbonyl is O.

But looking at the options, the only options with O2 are A, C, and D has O1.

Wait, no, option D is C6H12O, O=1. So if the compound has a carbonyl, then O must be at least 1. But if it also has an -OH, that would require O=2. So the formula must have O2 or more.

Looking at the options:

Options with O2:

A: C6H12O2

C: C6H10O2

So these are the only options with O2, which would allow for both the carbonyl and the -OH groups.

So the correct answer must be either A or C.

Now, let's focus on A and C.

For option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond, but not both. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, which implies a double bond. So for option A, the structure must have a double bond but not a ring. That's DoU=1 (double bond).

But the FTIR has a peak at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (maybe another C=O or conjugated double bond). If the structure is an ester with a double bond, that would require DoU=2 (double bond + carbonyl). But option A's DoU is 1, so that's not possible.

Wait, unless it's a single DoU from a ring, but how?

Wait, another thought: if the structure is a cyclic ketone with a double bond, but that would require more DoU than allowed by option A. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a conjugated system that uses the same DoU. For example, a ring with a conjugated double bond. But that's still two DoU.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So it could have a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

If the structure is an ester with a ring, that would account for O2 (ester) and the ring (DoU=1). But then where is the double bond? It must be present because of the vinyl H's in NMR. So if the structure is an ester with a double bond, that's two DoU (ester carbonyl and the double bond), which fits option C's DoU of 2.

So in that case, the structure would have both a carbonyl (ester) and a double bond (vinyl group). So the IR would show the carbonyl at ~1700 and the conjugated double bond at ~1650. The broad peak at 3000 would be the -OH group. Wait, but in an ester, where's the -OH? Esters have R-O-CO-O-R', but that's O in the ester, but not an -OH (unless it's a hydroxyl ester, which I'm not sure about). Wait, if the structure is an ester with an adjacent -OH group, that might not be possible due to resonance or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't an ester but another carbonyl-containing compound with an -OH. Let's think: maybe a beta-keto alcohol. For example, something like CH2(CO)CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure if that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, but as I thought earlier, that would require a higher DoU.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is an aromatic ester, like methyl benzoate. But benzoate is C7H6O2, which doesn't fit the options. So that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a furan ester. Furan is a five-membered ring with a double bond, which would account for the DoU. So, a furan ring with an ester group. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But I'm not certain.

Let me try to think about the mass spec again. Option C has a molecular weight of 114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. The fragment at 45 would suggest a loss of 114-45=69. But I'm not sure what that means.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, the ester group (COOR) could break off, leaving RCOO- as a fragment. But the mass would depend on R.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment at 45 is the loss of (CH2)2O, which is 44, but that's close. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CO, which is 58. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the vinyl group. If the structure has a CH2=CH-O- group, then the mass would be 44 (CH2=CHO-), but again, not matching 45.

Hmm.

Let me try to summarize:

The compound has:

- An -OH group (broad peak at ~3000)
- A carbonyl group (peak at 1700)
- A double bond (vinyl H's in NMR, and peak at 1650 could be C=C)
- The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

The possible formulas are C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H12O2 (option A).

Option A has DoU=1, which would require only a single ring or double bond. But since there's a double bond (from vinyl H's) and a carbonyl (another DoU), that would require DoU=2, which doesn't fit option A (DoU=1). So option A is unlikely.

Option C has DoU=2, which would fit if there's a carbonyl and a double bond. But where is the -OH group? Because in option C, there are two O's. If the structure is an ester (O2), but where is the -OH? Unless the structure has an ester and an -OH group, which would require O3, which is not the case. So perhaps the structure isn't an ester.

Wait, maybe the structure is a ketone with an -OH and a double bond. So O would be 2 (one from ketone, one from -OH), which fits option C.

So structure: a cyclohexenol with a ketone group? But I'm not sure. Let me think: cyclohexenol has a ring (DoU=1), a double bond (DoU=1), and an -OH (O=1). If there's a ketone, that adds another O, making O=2. But then, the DoU would be 3 (ring, double bond, ketone), which would require DoU=3, but option C's DoU is 2.

Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's not a ring. Maybe it's a dienol with a ketone or something. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxy ketone, but that would require more O's.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a substituted acrylate.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so let me try to think of another approach.

In the mass spec, m/z=45 could correspond to (CH3)2CHO (which is 58, no), or maybe CH2=CH-OH (which would have a mass of 44, but that's not 45). Alternatively, maybe (CH3)COOH (which is 60), no.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is the tropylium ion, which is 91. But that's not relevant here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ester cleavage. For example, in an ester, the R-O-CO-O-R' could split into R-O-CO+ and R'-, but I'm not sure how that would result in 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the methyl group from a methyl ester. The methyl group is 15, but that's not 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be a larger group.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH2)2CO, which is 58. No. Or C3H7O, which is 60. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is C3H5O+. Let me calculate that: (3*12)+(5)+(16)=36+5+16=57. No.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the options again.

If the correct formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the structure must have two O's, a double bond, and a carbonyl group. Plus, an -OH group. So, perhaps it's a dihydroxy ester? Wait, no, that would require more O's.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure with a double bond and a carbonyl, plus an -OH. For example, a cyclopentenolone derivative. Let me think: cyclopentenone has a ring (DoU=1), a double bond (DoU=1), and a ketone (DoU=1), making total DoU=3. But option C's DoU is 2, so that's not possible.

Wait, unless it's a cyclohexenol with a carbonyl group, but that would require more O's.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2.

If the structure has a carbonyl group (DoU=1) and a double bond (DoU=1), that fits DoU=2. So the structure could be something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but with the appropriate substituents to make the formula C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester with a vinyl group. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Then the formula would be C9H12O2, which is more than C6. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, methyl propenoate is C4H6O2, but that's not C6.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopropane ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an -OH group. The carbonyl at 1700 suggests an ester or ketone. The double bond (from vinyl H's) and the peak at 1650 (maybe a conjugated C=C).

The mass spec has a fragment at 45. I think this points towards an ester, as the fragment might come from the ester group breaking off.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond, then the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). Because esters have O2, and the double bond contributes to DoU=2, which matches.

So, putting it all together, option C (C6H10O2) is the likely candidate.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data: FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an -OH group.
- A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester or ketone.
- A **peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated double bond (C=C) or another carbonyl group.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of **vinyl hydrogens** (peaks corresponding to CH₂=CH-) confirms the presence of a double bond in the structure.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** suggests a common fragment, possibly from an ester or a related functional group.

### Option Analysis:
#### **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** (2(6) + 2 - 12)/2 = 1.
- A single DoU could correspond to a ring or a double bond. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens (indicating a double bond) and a carbonyl group (another DoU) would require a total of 2 DoU, which does not match the formula. Thus, this option is unlikely.

#### **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**
- **DoU:** (2(6) + 2 - 10)/2 = 2.
- Two DoU could correspond to a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. However, the FTIR data indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), which would require an additional oxygen, making this option inconsistent with the molecular formula.

#### **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **DoU:** (2(6) + 2 - 10)/2 = 2.
- Two DoU could correspond to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). The presence of an -OH group (from the broad IR peak) and a carbonyl group (from the ester or ketone) aligns with the molecular formula. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR and the fragment peak at m/z = 45 further support this option.

#### **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**
- **DoU:** (2(6) + 2 - 12)/2 = 1.
- Similar to Option A, a single DoU is insufficient to account for the double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) and the carbonyl group (another DoU). Thus, this option is also unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data, including the presence of an -OH group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond, along with the fragment peak at m/z = 45, strongly support **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the observed functional groups and degrees of unsaturation.
