Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about the stability of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, β, tell us about the stability of the complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, so those are the β values for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^+, [Co(SCN)3]^0, and [Co(SCN)4]^2- maybe? Or perhaps the order is different, but I'll assume they're in order of increasing n, the number of SCN- ligands.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands, so that would be [Co(SCN)2]^+. So we're looking for the percentage of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)2]^+ among all possible Co species.

To find this, I think I need to calculate the distribution of Co among all its possible complexes. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these complexes. The approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co^2+.

But wait, how do I start? I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the formula involving the β's and the concentrations of the ligand.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the stability constant and the ratio of ligand to metal ion. The formula for the fraction (f_n) of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The fraction for each species is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, β_0 would be 1 because [Co^2+] without any ligands is the free ion. So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but the problem gives us β1 to β4. So for each complex, the fraction is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (denominator). But wait, the denominator is the sum over all possible species, including the free Co^2+.

So, because we're given β1, β2, β3, β4, the denominator would be 1 (for Co^2+) plus β1[SCN] (for [CoSCN]+) plus β2[SCN]^2 (for [Co(SCN)2]^{
