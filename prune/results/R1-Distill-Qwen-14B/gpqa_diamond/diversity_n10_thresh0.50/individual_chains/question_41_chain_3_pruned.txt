Okay, I need to figure out the speed of light in glass relative to the observer when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Let's start by recalling some physics concepts. 

So, the problem says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. Wait, no, actually, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is also in the same direction as the glass's movement. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me parse that again. The beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So both the glass and the beam are moving towards the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. Because the beam is moving through the glass towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving through it in the same direction.

I'm a bit stuck on how to approach this. Maybe I should think about the speed of light in different reference frames. I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, but waitâ€”this might be a classical optics problem, not involving relativity. Because the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab, which could be treated using the relativistic velocity addition formula only if v is significant compared to c, but the options given don't look relativistic. Let me check the options. The options have terms like n*v, so maybe it's using a classical approach.

Wait, no. Wait, in classical physics, velocities just add up. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light's speed in the glass is c/n (since in vacuum it's c, and in the medium, it's c divided by n). But wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how do we calculate the speed?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused between the frame of the glass and the lab. Let me think. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab's frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, which is towards the observer. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. Then, to find the lab frame's
