Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about neutrino physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is that the Sun's pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's core has different fusion processes. The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, right? And there are different branches, like I, II, and III. Oh wait, the pp-III branch—so that's one of the branches in the proton-proton fusion. I think the main pp chain is the pp-I branch, which is the dominant one. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant, maybe alternative pathways?

The question is about the flux of neutrinos reaching Earth in two different energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). They're asking for the ratio of flux in band 1 over band 2. So, Flux1/Flux2.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun, and their energies depend on the specific reactions. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the proton-proton chain, which produces electron neutrinos. But then, there's also the CNO cycle, which contributes to neutrinos as well, right? So if the pp-III branch stops, but other reactions continue, what does that mean?

Hmm, neutrinos from the pp chain—I think the dominant ones are from the beta decay steps. In the pp-I branch, which is the main one, protons fuse through a couple of steps, and eventually a positron and a neutrino are emitted. So that's the primary source of the solar neutrinos we detect.

If the pp-III branch stops, but others are still active, which neutrinos are affected? I remember that the pp-III branch might involve higher energy reactions, perhaps leading to higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe not. Wait, no, I think the pp-III branch might produce neutrinos of a specific energy range. Let me think: in the pp chain, the main neutrinos come from the reaction where a boron-8 (B8) decays into Be8+e+νe. B8 has a half-life that leads to the emission of neutrinos at around 0.5 MeV or so. Wait, but wait, the energies in the question are in the hundreds of keV to a MeV range.

Wait, the pp-III branch—what happens there? I think in the pp-III branch, two protons fuse with a helium-4 nucleus (He-4) to form a He-6, which then undergoes beta decay. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a different pathway in the proton-proton chain that leads to the production of beryllium-8, but maybe with a different neutrino emission?

But regardless, the main point is that if the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected? Since the question mentions that only the pp-III branch is stopped, the other reactions (like pp-I and CNO) continue normally.

Wait, but the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would be
