Okay, so I've got this physics question about particle decays, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, the notation might be a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think the general structure is that the interaction term is something like λ times the product of two fermion fields (maybe Yukawa coupling style), and X is a boson field. So the interaction term would be something like λ ψ_f^dagger ψ_f X, where ψ_f is a fermion field.

But I'm not too stuck on the exact form of the Lagrangian right now. The key point is the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs can be produced when X decays.

In particle physics, for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the energy (or mass) of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would carry some rest mass, and for them to be created, the boson's mass has to be sufficient to provide that energy.

So, X can decay into a pair of fermions ff̄ if the mass of X is greater than or equal to 2m_f. So, first, I need to know the masses of the various fermions in the Standard Model.

Let me list the fermions and their approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV (but wait, that's way too light. So 2 MeV is 0.002 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV (0.004-0.005 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV (~0.095-0.1 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (0.5 MeV)
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- And their antiparticles, but that's besides the point.

Wait, but the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So, to produce a pair, the sum of the two fermions' rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But since each fermion in the pair is the same, it's 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So, which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let's look:

- u: 0.002 GeV → yes
- d: 0.005 GeV → yes
- s: 0.095 GeV → yes
- c: ~1.3 GeV → yes (1.3 < 3)
- b: 4.5 GeV → no (4.5 > 3)
- t: 173 GeV → no
- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ: 0.105 GeV → yes
- τ: 1.777 GeV → yes (1.777 <3)

Wait, but wait: the tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 2m_tau is ~3.554 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV? No, wait, 1.777
