Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities of objects and light, I should probably use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. Oh wait, because light is involved, right? Because in Newtonian mechanics, velocities just add up, but relativity changes that.

Wait, but the glass is moving, and the light is inside the glass. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, right? Because in a medium, the speed is lower. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n.

But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab. So this is a case where we have to transform velocities from one frame to another.

Oh, right, the velocity addition formula in special relativity. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the frame relative to the lab. Wait, but wait. Let me get the formula correct.

Wait, no, the standard formula is when you have a velocity u in the frame S
