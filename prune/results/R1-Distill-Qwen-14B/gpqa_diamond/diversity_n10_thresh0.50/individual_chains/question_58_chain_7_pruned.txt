Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those situations where the calculations give infinite results, which obviously don't make sense physically. So regularization helps to make these calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or something like that.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, let me think about each of these theories one by one.

Starting with option C, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know that QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. It's a well-established theory, and I remember that in QED, there are loop diagrams that can lead to divergences. Physicists use regularization methods like introducing a cutoff or using dimensional regularization to handle these. For example, the electron self-energy has divergences which are handled by renormalization. So QED does require regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I've heard that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and that it's asymptotically free. But does it require regularization? Well, when you do calculations in QCD, like for processes happening at low energies, you have issues with things like confinement and the formation of bound states. But in terms of regularization, I think QCD calculations can still lead to divergent loop integrals, so they do require regularizing techniques. Maybe things like lattice QCD use cutoffs, but even in perturbative calculations, I think regularization is necessary.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electric and magnetic fields in the classical sense, not involving quantum mechanics. So in classical theories, do you have any issues with divergences? Hmm. Wait, in classical E&M, you have things like the electric field of a point charge, which is infinite at the origin. Also, when charges are accelerating, like in the case of radiation, you might get infinite energy densities. But wait, does that require regularization? Or is it more of a mathematical issue that's handled by other means, like considering distributions or something else? I'm not sure. I think in classical
