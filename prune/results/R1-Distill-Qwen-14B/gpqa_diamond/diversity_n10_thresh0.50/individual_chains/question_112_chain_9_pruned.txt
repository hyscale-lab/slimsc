Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this stuff. But let's take it step by step. The question involves finding probabilities and an average value for a given operator. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, first I need to normalize this state because the coefficients (1+i) and (2-i) might not sum to 1. Right, the normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients should be 1. 

So, the coefficients are a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). Let me compute |a|² and |b|². 

|a|² is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2. 

|b|² is (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i -2i + i²? Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly. (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2² + (i)(2) - (i)(2) -i². Wait, no, it's (2)^2 - (i)^2 because it's (a-b)(a+b) = a² - b². So a is 2, b is i. So 2² is 4, and i² is -1. So 4 - (-1) = 5. So |b|² is 5.

So the total squared magnitude is |a|² + |b|² = 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, the problem says we're to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix? Because |up> and |down> are two eigenstates. So the operator A is zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, let me write the matrix. Let me index the rows and columns as
