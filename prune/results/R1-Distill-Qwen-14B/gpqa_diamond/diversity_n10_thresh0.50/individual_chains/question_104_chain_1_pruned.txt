Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Hmm, let me read it again.

Astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars that have the same mass as each other and similar to our Sun. They found one planet each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in a spectral line. For Planet #2's host star, the shift was 7 milliangstrom. The question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

The options are A to D. I need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically P2/P1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet orbits. The shift depends on the star's velocity towards and away from us as it's pulled by the planet. The formula I think is that the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3), where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the inclination angle (which is 90 degrees for a circular orbit since sin i = 1). Oh wait, but in reality, maybe the exact formula is a bit different.

Alternatively, I recall the RV semi-amplitude formula: K = (v) = ( (G) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )^(1/3) ) ) ... Wait, that might be more complicated. But since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p << M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So that makes things a bit easier.

Wait, but the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so that term is negligible. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since the problem states that the stars have the same mass, which is similar to the Sun, M_star is the same for both stars. So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) ). Wait, let's get that right.

Wait, let me re-derive it. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π / (c) )
