Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The setup is a bit specific: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given in Joules, but some of them are really small, like 10^-26 or 10^-27, and one is 122.330, which is way larger. Hmm. So I'm thinking the energy here is related to the potential energy between the charges.

Wait, but potential energy in electrostatics. Right. The potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. So for two point charges, the potential energy U is k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But when there are multiple charges, like a system of n charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, the system here includes 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th. So all 12 are at the same distance from the central charge.

Wait, but wait, the 12 charges are identical, and the 13th is also identical. So each has charge 2e. So the charge on each particle is 2 times the elementary charge. So each is 2e.

So the potential energy would involve interactions between each pair. But here, some pairs are between the 13th charge and each of the 12 others, and others are between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm. Wait, but wait, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So they can't move closer or farther from P; they're fixed at that distance. So the only thing that can vary is the arrangement between the 12 charges. Oh, but wait, no, because if they're constrained to be at 2 m from P, maybe their positions are all on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. But their mutual distances can vary as long as they stay on that sphere. Hmm, but wait, they are point charges, so their positions on the sphere could affect their mutual potential energy.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the 12 charges are placed in such a way that the potential energy between them is minimized. But how?

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the system's potential energy is
