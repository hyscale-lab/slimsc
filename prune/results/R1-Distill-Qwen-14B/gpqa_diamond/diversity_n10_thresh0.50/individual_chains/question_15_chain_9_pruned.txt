Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one that's more likely to transit because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, so both have the same mass? Oh right, the question says they share the same masses. So their masses don't affect the transit probability directly, I think. Because transit probability depends more on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Orbital periods are different, though. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is 3P1. Or wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, so P1 = P2 / 3. So P2 is longer.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but stars' radii and masses aren't always directly proportional. Oh, but the question says both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The probability is higher when the orbit is edge-on, which is when the planet transits. The probability is roughly (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say the probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies to (R_star)/(a).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by some factor. Oh, right! The formula I remember is that the transit probability P = (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but for a circular orbit, e=0, so it's just (R*/a).

Wait, but actually, I think the correct formula is P = (R* /
