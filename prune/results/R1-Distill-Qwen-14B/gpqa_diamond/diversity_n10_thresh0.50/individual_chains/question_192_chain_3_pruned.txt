Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges and electric fields. Let me think through this step by step.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Got it. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. Now, I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and from the cavity's center, it's a distance l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside.

Wait, so the conductor was initially uncharged. When I place a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in conductors, charges redistribute in such a way that the interior of the conductor doesn't have any electric field. But wait, this is a conductor with a cavity. Oh right, the charges in the conductor will rearrange to cancel the electric field inside the conductor, but the cavity is a different story.

So when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will develop an induced charge. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the inner surface must have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Because the conductor was uncharged initially, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q to balance it out. Wait, no, because the total charge on the conductor is zero. Oh, wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so the total charge after induction must still be zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, because the net charge is zero.

But wait, wait a second. The conductor is neutral, so when you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have -q induced. Since the conductor itself has no net charge, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner is -q, the outer must be +q to keep the conductor's total charge at zero.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P should only depend on the charge outside the
