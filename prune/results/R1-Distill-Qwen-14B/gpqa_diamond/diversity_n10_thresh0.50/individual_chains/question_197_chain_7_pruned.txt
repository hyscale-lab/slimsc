Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, which are different substituted benzene derivatives.

First, I think I should analyze the spectral data given. Let's start with the IR spectrum. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H or N-H stretch. But looking at the other peaks, 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if there's an O-H peak around 3400, that's broad, maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1720 could be the carbonyl for that. Then there's 1610 and 1450, which might be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group.

Moving on to the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a really high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait—if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be even broader and maybe around 10-12 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, an aldehyde is usually around 9-10 ppm. Hmm. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm, but maybe the singlet here is something else. Let me think. Maybe it's an aldehyde, but I'm not certain yet.

Another peak is at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) also a doublet. So this looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets suggest that the substituent is at the para position, giving two sets of doublets for the aromatic protons. So the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, but wait, that might not be the
