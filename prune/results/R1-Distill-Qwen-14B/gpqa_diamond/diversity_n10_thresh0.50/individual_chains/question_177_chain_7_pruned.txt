Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let's try to break it down. So, the question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Wait, but the question is about luminosity, so I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here. Oh, wait, luminosity for stars is usually related to radius and temperature, right? Because I remember the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So maybe mass isn't directly needed here unless it affects the temperature somehow.

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength. So, the peak wavelength is determined by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same because T = b / λ_max. So T1 = T2. That simplifies things because now both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. How can that be? Because in reality, more massive stars are hotter, but the problem here says that the peak wavelengths are the same. So, perhaps this is a hypothetical scenario where despite their masses, their temperatures are the same. So, moving forward with that, both stars have the same temperature.

So, now, the luminosity formula comes into play. L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since T is the same for both, L is proportional to R². So L1 / L2 = (R1²)/(R2²). R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Therefore, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have some numbers close to that. Option A is ~2.25, so that's in the options.

But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. The radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving much. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. Oh, but wait, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Hmm. Because when a star is moving, does it affect its apparent brightness?

Wait, I think there's another aspect here. Maybe it's about Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength of the light it emits can change. But in the problem statement, the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is the same.

So, Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. So the Doppler effect would shift the emitted wavelengths. Let me think: the Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, I might have that backward. Wait, when a source is moving away,
