Okay, so I have this question about stars' distribution and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed... I think that means the same number density throughout space, not clustered or anything. So the number of stars depends on the volume available up to a certain distance.

Wait, parallax is in arcseconds, and distance in parsecs. The formula is distance = 1 / plx. So if plx increases, the distance decreases. But wait, no, if plx is larger, distance is smaller. Because plx is 1/distance in parsecs.

So, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the distance. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d+Δd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell is 4πd² Δd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d².

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so I need to relate this to plx. Parallax plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let's write d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then, the volume shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 Δd. Wait, no, the shell's volume is 4πd²Δd. But we need to express this in terms of plx, not d.

Let me substitute d = 1/plx. So d² is 1/(plx^2). And Δd is a small change in distance. But since plx is a function of d, let me express Δd in terms of plx. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = (-1)/ (plx²) d plx. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Actually, for small changes, Δd = - (1 / plx²) Δplx. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So the derivative dd/d plx = -1/(plx^2). So Δd ≈ -(1/plx²) Δplx.
