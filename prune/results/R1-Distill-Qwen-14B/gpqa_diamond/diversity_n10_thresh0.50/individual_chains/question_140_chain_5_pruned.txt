Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Let me read the details again.

So, Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, I think. So, B is probably a solid that's just about to melt around that temperature.

Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Oh, and X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, I'm thinking maybe X is something like a strong base or a metal that reacts exothermically.

Let me think about the possible reactions. When metals react with liquids, perhaps an acid? Wait, but the product is a precipitate. Maybe it's a double displacement reaction. But if Y is a liquid, perhaps water? Or maybe Y is an acid, like HCl or H2SO4? Let's see.

If X is a metal, reacting with an acid (like Y) would produce a salt, gas, and maybe a precipitate. Wait, but the precipitate G forms. Alternatively, maybe Y is a base or something else.

The gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule must be something like H2O (2 H, 1 O: H has 1 neutron and proton, O has 8 each. Wait, but H2O has 2 H (each has 1n,1p) and O has 8n and 8p. So total: (2*(1,1)) and (8,8). So the molecule's total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 2*(0) + 8=8. Wait, that's not equal. Hmm, or maybe another molecule.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? Let's see: CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons?), O (8 each). So each molecule would have 6+8*2 = 22 protons, and 6 + 8*2=22 neutrons. So same number of protons and neutrons,
