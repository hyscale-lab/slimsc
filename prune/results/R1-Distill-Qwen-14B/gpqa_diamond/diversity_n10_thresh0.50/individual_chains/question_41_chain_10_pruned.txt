Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, right? So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, which is the usual assumption.

Hmm. I remember that when objects move relative to each other, there's something about how light's speed is measured. I think it's related to the principle of relativity, where the speed of light remains constant in all inertial frames. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me think. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_glass, which would be c/n, right? Because the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is c/n.

Wait, but the glass itself is moving at velocity v. So, how does that affect the speed observed in the lab frame?

I remember something about adding velocities in relativity, but I'm not sure if that applies here because this is about light, not objects. Oh wait, the Michelson-Morley experiment comes to mind. They tried to measure
