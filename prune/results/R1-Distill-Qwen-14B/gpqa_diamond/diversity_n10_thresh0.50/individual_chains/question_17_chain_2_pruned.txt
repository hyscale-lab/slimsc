Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so it's like the calcium is bound to the EDTA. The K given is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is.

Wait, so the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. The formula for that is K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA]). Oh right, because the formation constant is the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the individual ions.

In this problem, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh, but wait, that's the total concentration of the complex, meaning it's at stoichiometric amounts. So, I think we can assume that the concentration of the complex is [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M.

But wait, considering the dissociation of the complex, only a small amount will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be what we're trying to find.

Let me think. The formation constant equation is K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in the solution, the EDTA might not all be in the form that's available to react. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal. I think that implies that EDTA is in its correct form (like Y^4-), so we don't have to worry about other protonated forms. So, [EDTA] here is the same as the concentration of the free EDTA ions.

Wait, no, the Ca-EDTA complex is a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, right? So each Ca²+ binds one EDTA. So, the concentration of the complex is
