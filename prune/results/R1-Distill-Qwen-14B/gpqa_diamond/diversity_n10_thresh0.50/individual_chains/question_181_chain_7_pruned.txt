Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy, especially in the Sun's core. The pp-III branch must be a specific part of that process.

Wait, the question is about neutrino flux in two energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find the ratio of their fluxes after the pp-III branch stops.

I think that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a certain type of neutrino. Maybe it's the Beryllium-7 neutrinos? Or wait, isn't the main neutrino from the Sun the one from the proton-proton chain? Oh right, pp-I, II, and III are different steps in the proton-proton cycle. The pp-III branch probably leads to the dominant neutrino emission, maybe the 7 Be neutrinos or the pep neutrinos. Or wait, perhaps the main neutrinos from the pp chain are the ones from the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle? No, I think the CNO cycle produces fewer neutrinos. 

Wait, the pp chain produces neutrinos as part of the process. The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp-I, II, and III branches. The dominant ones are the Beryllium-7 (7Be) neutrinos, which I think are from the pp-II branch. Oh, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Maybe the pp-III branch produces a different energy of neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of a certain kind of neutrino would stop. But what about the flux in the two energy bands? Well, the flux is the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second. So if a part of the neutrino production stops, the flux in a certain band would decrease.

Wait, let's think about the neutrino energies. The 7Be neutrinos have an energy around 420 keV, I think. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh, wait, the 7Be neutrinos are about 0.42 MeV, which is 420 keV. Then, there are the pep neutrinos which
