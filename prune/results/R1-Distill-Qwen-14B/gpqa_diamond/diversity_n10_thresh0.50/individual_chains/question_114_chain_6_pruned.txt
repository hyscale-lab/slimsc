Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes that product and uses reagent B (with water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible A and B pairs, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, no, looking again, the second part of the first reaction's product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, and the second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I misread. So, the first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A giving the nitrile. Then, using reagent B and water on that nitrile gives a carboxylic acid.

Wait, no, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, maybe the first reaction is a nitrile formation, and the second is a hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones can undergo various reactions.
