Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor allows the bond length to change, unlike the rigid rotor model. But wait, the problem gives a bond length, so maybe it's still considering the bond as fixed for this calculation, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that will take it to the next lowest state.

The given data includes the masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu), bond length R (2 angstroms), and angular frequency Ï‰ (4e14 rad/s). The options are all momenta in N*s.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it can either change its vibrational state or its rotational state. The next lowest state would probably be the next vibrational state or perhaps a change in rotation as well. But I should think about the energy transitions.

In the quantum mechanical models, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule typically consist of vibrational and rotational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher energy state. Since the question is about the next state with the
