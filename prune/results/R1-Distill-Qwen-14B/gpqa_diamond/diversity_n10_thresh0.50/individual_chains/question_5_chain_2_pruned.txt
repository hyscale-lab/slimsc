Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, wait, the operator P is probably a spin operator, right? Because in quantum mechanics, spin operators often have components like P_x, P_y, P_z, each with their own matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices come into play here. 

The problem gives me the components of P. Let's parse that. 

P_x is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, -i], and second row [i, 0]. That's the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) times diag(1, -1), which is the Pauli Z matrix. 

So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane... Oh, wait, n is in the x-z plane, so it's a direction vector (n_x, 0, n_z). So the unit vector n has components (a, 0, b) where a² + b² = 1. But the direction is arbitrary, so the eigenvector might be expressed in terms of some angles.

Wait, the operator in question is probably the spin component along n. Because the operator P is given, but I'm to find its eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator we're considering is P · n, right? Because the spin operator in direction n is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector's components.

So the operator is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so Py doesn't contribute. 

So P·n can be written as (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) * (ħ/2), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices. 

The eigenvectors of P·n for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would then be the spin-up states along direction n. These eigenvectors can be expressed in terms of the angles that define the direction of n. 

Wait, direction n is in x-z plane, so we can parametrize it using polar angles. Let's think about spherical coordinates. The direction n can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis and an angle φ from the x-axis in the x-y plane. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero? Wait, no. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) would be 0 or π, depending on the direction in x-z. Wait, but in standard spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is in the x-y plane. So for a direction in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. But the problem states it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so perhaps
