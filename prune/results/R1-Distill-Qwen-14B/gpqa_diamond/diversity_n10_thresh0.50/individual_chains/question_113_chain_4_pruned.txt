Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. 

Hmm, let me start by breaking down each of the spectroscopy clues.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually correspond to O-H stretching. A broad peak suggests that the O-H is probably in a structure that allows for hydrogen bonding, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid's O-H peak is usually stronger and broader than an alcohol's. Also, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 might be another carbonyl group, maybe an ester or something else. Or perhaps the 1650 is from conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests it's not aromatic but maybe an alkene.

Wait, the NMR part says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond.

Now, looking at the Mass Spectrometry data, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think about what could give a m/z of 45. Maybe a CH3CO+ ion? The molecular formula for that would be C2H3O2, but wait, 45 is (CH3CO+) is 45. Alternatively, maybe it's from a ketene or something else. Or perhaps a CH2O group?

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and their degrees of uns
