Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), right? Oh wait, but the problem says the energy levels' difference is ΔE, so that's 1.38e-23 J. 

In this case, the ratio of the populations is given. For star_1, the excitation is twice as much, so n1_upper / n1_lower = 2. And for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower. Wait, but the problem says star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So I'm a bit confused. Let me read it again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... compared to star_2." Oh, so perhaps the ratio for star_1 is higher. Let me think: if star_1 is more excited, that means more atoms are in
