Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm. So let me think. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3. Also, their orbits are circular.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So even though one star is more massive, their radii are the same. That might affect the transit probability.

Wait, the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out the transit probability for each.

I recall that the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula I think is something like the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something related to the orbital distance, right? Or maybe the orbital size compared to the star's size?)

Wait, no, wait. The geometric probability for a transit is given by the formula (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2), where 'a' is the orbital radius, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, I think the formula is (R_star / a)^2 for the transit probability. Because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the area where the planet can cross our line of sight is a function of the star's size relative to the orbital distance. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a)^2, but wait no, actually, I think the correct formula is (R_star / a) * (something else? Because the transit can only happen if the planet's orbit is along our line of sight, which depends on the orbital inclination. The probability is actually the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, squared, divided by something else? Wait, no, maybe it's (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait,
