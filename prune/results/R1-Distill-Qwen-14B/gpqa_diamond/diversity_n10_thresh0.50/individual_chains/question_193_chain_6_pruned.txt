Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh yeah, because if something is closer, its parallax is larger. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait a second, but that can't be right because more distant things should have fewer stars if we're counting in a certain way... Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So they're asking for the density of stars as a function of distance. Let me think about how number relates to distance. The number of stars is N = k / plx^5, with k being a constant of proportionality.

Since plx = 1/d, substitute back into N: N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power? That seems counterintuitive because usually, things get fainter or less dense with distance. But maybe this is a specific region where more distant stars are being observed in a way that the number increases with distance. But I'm not sure yet.

But wait, the question isn't asking about the number of stars at a distance d, it's asking how the number changes with distance. Like, the rate of change, or the change per unit range. So perhaps they're asking for the differential number of stars per unit distance. Because when you look at a range dr, the number of stars in that shell would
