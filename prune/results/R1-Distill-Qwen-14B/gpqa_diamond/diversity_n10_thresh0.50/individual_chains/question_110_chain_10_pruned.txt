Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So if a star's V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, the star's V must be ≤16 mag.

Wait, wait. Wait, because the question says that both spectrographs can detect the star. So the star must be observable by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO to see it) and ≤16 (for HIRES to see it). So the stricter condition is the V magnitude must be ≤16. Because if a star is brighter than 16, both can see it. But if it's between 16 and 17, HIRES can't observe it, but ESPRESSO can. So for both to detect, the star must be ≤16 mag.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be detectable by both, so it must satisfy the condition for both. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES needs it to
