Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh wait, K here is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where EDTA binds to Ca²+.

So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). K is a big number, which means the reaction favors the product, so most of the Ca²+ is bound into the complex.

But wait, the solution is stoichiometric, meaning that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio initially. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that implies that initially, we had 0.02 M Ca²+ and 0.02 M EDTA. But when they form the complex, let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ that remains uncomplexed.

Let me think. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. The formation constant K is given. So, the expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in the initial setup, without considering any dissociation, all the Ca²+ would be bound into the complex. However, because the formation constant is very large, almost all of the Ca²+ is in the complex. So the unbounded Ca²+ concentration is going to be very low, which is what we need to find.

Let me set up the variables. Let’s let s be the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Since the complex dissociates a bit, the amount of EDTA^4- free would be s as well because for each s of Ca²+ produced, you get s of EDTA^4-.

Wait, but initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M because stoichiometric amounts are used. So the initial
