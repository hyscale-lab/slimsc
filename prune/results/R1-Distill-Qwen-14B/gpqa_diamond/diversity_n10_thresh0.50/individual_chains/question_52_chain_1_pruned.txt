Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star with spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, let's break this down.

Alright, the star's parameters are given: it has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait, I think I need to clarify: does the 40% coverage mean that the spots make 40% of the surface cooler, or that the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding? Oh right, spots on a star are darker and cooler regions.

The main thing here is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is level 1 to level 2, right? They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

Wait, the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. That is, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the Boltzmann equation applies for the population of energy levels. The ratio of populations should depend on the temperature. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1) / (k*T) ), but wait, wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if level 1 has lower energy than level 2, E2 > E1. So E_i - E_j would be E1 - E2, but if i is 1 and j is 2, then it's (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ).
