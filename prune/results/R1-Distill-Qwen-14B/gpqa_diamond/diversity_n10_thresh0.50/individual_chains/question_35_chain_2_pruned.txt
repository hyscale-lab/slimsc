Okay, so I've got this problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h over 4π. Oh wait, S is a matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, let me write that out.

So, S is a 2x2 matrix:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S. So I can write Ay as (h/(4π)) multiplied by S.

Wait, but when I multiply, each element of S gets multiplied by c. So the matrix Ay would be:

[ 0*(h/(4π))   (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0*(h/(4π)) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0       ]

Now, I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me remember how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix A are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So, let's set up the characteristic equation for Ay. The matrix Ay - λ I is:

[ -λ       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  -λ       ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Compute this determinant:

det = λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, let's calculate that cross term. (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (h/(4π))² * 1.

So det = λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So the equation is λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Oh no,
