Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The first part is about butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give different choices for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN is providing the cyanide ion as a nucleophile. But wait, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh right, I think this is a hydrocyanation reaction. But wait, no. Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it usually forms a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound with both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

So the reaction here is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But how does this happen? I think the mechanism involves the cyanide attacking the carbonyl carbon, then the oxygen becomes an -O- which then gets protonated. But wait, in reality, the
