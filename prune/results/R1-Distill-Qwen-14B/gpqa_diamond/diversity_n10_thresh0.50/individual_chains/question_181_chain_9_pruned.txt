Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I need to figure out the ratio between two energy bands. Hmm, let's start by understanding the setup.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) from the Sun's core to reach Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, any changes in neutrino production would take that time to affect us. But since the question is about the flux now, I guess the changes have reached us, and we're seeing the effects.

So the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main pp-I branch is the dominant process, but there's also pp-II and pp-III. I remember that the pp-III branch involves higher mass states of helium-4 and lithium-7. But wait, how does that affect neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly via the proton-proton chain. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp-I and maybe pp-II and III processes? Or wait, perhaps each branch contributes differently to the neutrino spectrum.

The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I. Oh right, because pp-III involves heavier isotopes, so the reactions might release more energy, leading to higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos would decrease, but the lower-energy ones (from pp-I and II) would remain the same.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So before the pp-III stopped, both bands would be getting neutrinos from various sources. But after, the higher-energy band (800-900) would have less neutrinos because pp-III contributes more to higher energies.

But wait, let me think again. So the pp-III is a small contributor compared to pp-I. Because pp-I is the main process in the Sun, right? So if pp-III stops, the main impact is on the higher-energy neutrinos.

In the Sun's neutrino flux, the majority comes from the
