Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it through and figure out what's going on. 

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves a little because of the planet's gravity, and this causes the spectral lines to shift periodically. The shift depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period, I think.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms. Planet #2's shift was 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Hmm. So, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by some formula. Let me think. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) / (1 + m/M), but wait, wait, maybe in terms of the planet's mass. Oh right, the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / ( (P)^(2/3) * c )

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula correctly. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since it's a circular orbit, and RV detects planets with sin i, but since both are detected, probably both are edge-on, so sin i is 1), and the orbital period.

Wait, no, the exact formula is a bit more complicated. Maybe it's better to recall that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_*)) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but perhaps a simpler approach is to consider that for a given star mass, the RV semi-amplitude K depends on (M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so K ≈ (M_p / M_*)^(1) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) * (some constants).

Wait, perhaps the exact formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let me think about the relationship between K and the orbital period, given that the stars are the same mass and the planet masses are similar (Neptune mass). Wait, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. And the stars are the same mass, M_*1 = M_*2 = M_sun.

So, if M_p1 ≈ M_p
