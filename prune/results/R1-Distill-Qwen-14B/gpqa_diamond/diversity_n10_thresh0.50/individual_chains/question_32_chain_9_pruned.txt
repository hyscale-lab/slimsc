Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because the atomic number is 3 (Li) and the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the concepts of gamma and relativistic energy. The energy of a particle in a collider is given by the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. The formula I recall is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, let me plug that in.

Wait, let's compute gamma first. Let me compute v squared over c squared. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So v²/c² is (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me check that calculation. Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 which equals 3.5714... approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need to find the energy E. But wait, the mass m here is the mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus. So I need to find the rest mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Wait, I'm a bit unsure about the exact value. Let me think. I recall that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = ?

Calculating:
3*(1.007276) = 3.021828
3*(1.008665) = 3.025995
Adding together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u. Wait, but that's heavier than the actual mass of Li-6. Because in reality, when you combine protons and neutrons, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. So the actual mass of Li-6 is less than the sum of individual nucleon masses. Hmm, I should look up the exact value. Oh wait, I'm supposed to just rely on what I remember. Let me think: I remember that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.0151 u. Wait, but wait. Another approach is to use the mass number. The mass number A is 6, so the mass is approximately 6 u, but precisely, it's a bit less due to the binding energy. So I'll proceed with 6.0151 u for Li-6.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact value. Let me think again. Alternatively, if I don't have the exact value, maybe I can use the mass of a proton and neutron to compute the approximate mass of Li-6. Wait, but the protons and neutrons have slightly different masses, so maybe it's better to use the exact formula. Wait, the mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 u. Let me go with that for now.

Wait, another approach. The mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass of the individual protons and neutrons, minus the mass defect due to binding. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. Then subtract the binding energy. But the binding energy is given by the mass defect multiplied by c², but we're working in atomic mass units. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as m = 6.0151 u. Let me proceed with that.

So m = 6.0151 u. Now, I need to convert this into kilograms to use in the energy formula. Because 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m = 6.0151 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.
