Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with atoms in stars, the excitation levels are related to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann equation. Let me think.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—it's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k_B * something, maybe the temperature? Or wait, no, ΔE is given, so probably we'll use the Boltzmann factor in the equation.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the number of particles in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)). So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) depends on the temperature.

In this case, for the two stars, the excitation level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. Let me denote the excitation as N for star_1 and M for star_2. So N = 2M. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Oh, wait, I might have misread. Oh, no, it says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So the number of atoms in that excited state is higher in star_1. So the ratio is N1/N2 = 2.

The ratio according to the Boltzmann factor would be N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) ) / exp( - (ΔE)/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait, Boltzmann distribution for two levels (ground and excited) is N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that the ground state is the lower energy level, and ΔE is the energy difference from ground to excited. So for each star, that ratio would be:

For star 1: N1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly for star
