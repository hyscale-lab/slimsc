Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see, the question has three parts (A, B, C) and each involves a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each case and then match them with the options given.

First, I'll start with part A. The reaction is dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Wait, what's the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate? The (E) configuration means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. The structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. But with a substituent at the gamma position? Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR; if the substituent is at the 3-position (the one next to the double bond), then it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-CH3? Or is the acrylate group CH2=CHCOO- attached to something else. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's more like the acrylate is at the 3-position. Let me see: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. The compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait. Hmm, maybe the structure is CH2
