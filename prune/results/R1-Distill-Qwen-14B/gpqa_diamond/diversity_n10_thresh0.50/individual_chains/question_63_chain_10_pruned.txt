Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. The masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the fundamental state and the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. But how exactly do the energy levels work here?

I remember that for the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model, which probably means it includes both rotation and vibration. Oh right, in the non-rigid rotor (or vibration-rotation) model, the energy also includes vibrational terms. So the total energy is a combination of both.

The energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be modeled using the equation that includes both the rotational and vibrational parts. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. And the rotational energy depends on J, the rotational quantum number.

So the total energy E = E_vib + E_rot. For the fundamental state, that's the lowest energy, which would be the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state. Wait, no. I think the fundamental vibrational state is v=0, and the rotational state is J=0 (or perhaps J=1, depending on the model). Hmm, maybe the fundamental state refers to the lowest possible state, which would be v=0 and J=0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next higher energy state. But what's the next possible state? The next higher state could be an increase in either vibrational or rotational quantum number. But wait, the question is about the "next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, right, that's the next state which has the least increase in energy
