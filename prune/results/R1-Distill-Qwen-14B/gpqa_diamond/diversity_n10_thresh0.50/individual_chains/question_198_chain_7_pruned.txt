Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me see if I can break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The given data includes concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate, as well as stability constants for different complexes. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are related to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, what do these β's correspond to? I think each β is for a different complex. Like, β1 might be for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^(?), and so on. Each step adds another SCN^- ion.

The question is specifically about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, right? So that's probably the Co(SCN)_2^(n+) complex, which has β2=40. Or wait, maybe I need to check the sequence. Let me think: the complexes are Co(SCN)^n+ where n is the number of SCN. So β1 is for Co(SCN)^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think in some cases, the different complexes have different colors, and the blue one is the one with two SCN ligands. So we're looking at the species [Co(SCN)_2]^+ perhaps. Hmm, I'm not 100% sure, but let's proceed.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ among all cobalt species. To find this, I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ relative to all possible Co species.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach involves setting up
