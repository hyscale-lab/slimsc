Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, classical mechanics don't apply, and we need to use special relativity. So for relative velocity, I think the formula isn't just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different.

The formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving at u and v relative to a third frame is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, wait, let me get that right. So for astronaut 1 moving at u = 0.6c and astronaut 2 moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So the relative speed of astronaut 2 from astronaut 1's frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Because in astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at v' relative to him.

Wait, no, I might have that backwards. Let me make sure. If both are moving in the same direction, then from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by the denominator. Wait, that would be negative, but since speed is positive, maybe I should take the absolute value. Or perhaps I should just compute it correctly.

Wait, no, the formula is (v - u) when both are moving in the same direction. Let me think. So u is the velocity of the first frame as seen from the second. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the velocity of the second object as seen from the first object's frame. So if the first object is moving at u=0.6c in the lab frame, and the second at v=0.5c, then in the first's frame, the second is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think of the scenario: The lab frame has both moving in the positive x-direction, astronaut 1 at u=0
