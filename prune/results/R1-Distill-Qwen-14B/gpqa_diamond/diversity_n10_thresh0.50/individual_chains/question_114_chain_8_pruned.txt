Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me see what it's about. So, the question involves two reactions, and I need to figure out which reagents A and B are used. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing different reagents. 

Let me start by looking at the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The reagent is NaCN and another reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me think about what's happening here.

Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? And when it reacts with NaCN, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via various reactions. Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution. But wait, ketones typically don't react with NaCN directly. Oh wait, there's something called the Stephen reduction or maybe the Bayer-Villiger oxidation? No, those don't fit here. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enolate formation. 

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But ketones aren't usually that reactive towards nucleophilic additions. Unless it's under specific conditions. Oh wait, I think when a ketone is treated with a cyanide source, like NaCN, under acidic conditions, it can undergo a substitution. Wait, no, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, that's right! A cyanohydrin is formed when a
