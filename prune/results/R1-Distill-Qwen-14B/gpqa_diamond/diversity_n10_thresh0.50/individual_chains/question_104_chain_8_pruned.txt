Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

Alright, so the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar in mass to Neptune. They're using the radial velocity (RV) method to detect these planets. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Now, the key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravity making the star move. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(something?), but wait, maybe I should think about the formula more precisely.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = ( (2π G) / (P (c)) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

But since both planets are around stars with the same mass (M_*) and M_p is similar (Neptune mass), but wait, in this problem, the actual masses might matter. Or perhaps we can make some simplifying assumptions.

Wait, but both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses. So M_* is same for both, M_p is same as well. But the RV shifts are different. The shift is related to the velocity of the star, which is K. So the K for each planet is 5 and 7 milliangstroms, but wait, milliangstrom is a unit of wavelength shift. To get velocity, I need to convert that.

Wait, I think the formula to convert a wavelength shift (Δλ) to velocity (v) is v = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the
