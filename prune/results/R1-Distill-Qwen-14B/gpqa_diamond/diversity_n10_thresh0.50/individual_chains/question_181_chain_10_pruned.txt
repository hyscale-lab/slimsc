Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Neutrinos are produced by various processes in the Sun, and their flux (the number per cmÂ² per second) depends on these processes.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces helium-4, and then there's pp-II and pp-III. Wait, actually, I might be mixing up the details. Oh, right, the pp chain has different branches. The main one, pp-I, which is the dominant process, leads to He-4. There's also the pp-II branch, which produces some boron, and the pp-III branch, which leads to carbon-12, I think. Or wait, maybe it's more about the specific reaction steps. But I'm not too sure about the exact details, but for this problem, I need to focus on how the neutrino production changes if pp-III stops.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So when the pp-III branch stops, how does this affect the flux in each band?

I remember that in the Sun, the dominant neutrino production comes from the pp-I branch,
