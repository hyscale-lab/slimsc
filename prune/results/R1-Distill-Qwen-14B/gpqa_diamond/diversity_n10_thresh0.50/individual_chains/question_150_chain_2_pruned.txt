Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oh wait, formula is C8H9NO. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plug in: (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde or ketone group (another 1) maybe. Or perhaps an aromatic ring plus a conjugated system.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H) â†’ That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. High upfield, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two other protons. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde, but then why is it a triplet? Or maybe it's an acidic proton like an enol or something else. Alternatively, could it be an alpha proton adjacent to an aldehyde group?

Wait, another
