Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, let me write that down to make it clearer. So ρ is equal to one half times (|0>⟨0| plus |1>⟨1|). Oh right, these are projectors onto the basis states |0> and |1>. 

I think each of these projectors is a rank-1 matrix. So when you add them, you're adding two projectors. But since each is a separate basis state, their sum should be a diagonal matrix, right? Because |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1| which has 1 at (1,1). So adding them gives a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ as a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal.

Wait, but what does this represent? A density matrix usually describes a mixed state. If the density matrix is diagonal, that suggests it's a classical mixture of the basis states. Because if the off-diagonal terms are zero, there's no coherence between the states. So that makes sense here—this ρ is a completely mixed state for a qubit.

Now the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states where each point on the sphere corresponds to a possible state. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Wait, the Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So the vector r is (x, y, z) where x = Tr(ρ X), y = Tr(ρ Y), z = Tr(ρ Z), and X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

So for this ρ, let me compute each component. The Pauli matrices are X = [[0,1],[1,0]], Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

First, let's compute Tr(ρ X). The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements after multiplying ρ with X. ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|), so in matrix form, ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Multiplying ρ with X: X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so ρ X would be [[0.5*0 + 0*1, 0.5*1 + 0*0],[0*0 + 0.5*1, 0*1 + 0.5*0]] Wait
