Okay, so I have this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, 'excited' here probably refers to the population of a specific energy level. In stellar atmospheres, when they're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is close to the value of Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k * T, maybe? Or wait, ΔE is given, so we can relate the temperatures.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Let me clarify what 'twice as excited' means. I think it means that the number of atoms in
