Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number would be 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So X is Li-6, right?

So the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when particles are moving close to the speed of light, we need to use the theory of relativity. The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes in these problems, especially in colliders, the energy mentioned is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy? I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So I think RHIC provides energy to accelerate the ions to a certain speed. So I believe we're looking for the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

Let me jot down the formula. The total energy E is gamma * m0c², where m0 is the rest mass. The gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma first.

Calculating gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Because 0.0784 is 784e-4. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.
