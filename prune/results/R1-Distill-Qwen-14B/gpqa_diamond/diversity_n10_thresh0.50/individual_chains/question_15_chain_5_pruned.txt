Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit, so the researchers can observe it. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says that both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is like 30 days, Planet_2 is 90 days? Or wait, the exact numbers don't matter; the ratio is what's important.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. That's interesting. I think a star's radius affects the transit depth, but the probability of transit might be more about the orbital size and the star's size.

Wait, the probability of a transit depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but also on the orbital distance. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is given by the formula P = (R_* / a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*)) ), but for Earth-like planets and stars, R_p is negligible compared to R_*, so maybe it's approximately P ≈ (R_* / a). Because the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), as that determines how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight.

Wait, but I might be mixing up some terms. Let me think. The transit probability is approximately (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis. So the larger the star relative to the orbit, the higher the probability. So if a planet is closer to its star (smaller a), the probability is higher because R_star is divided by a smaller a.

Wait, but in the formula, it's R_* divided by a. So if a is smaller, R_* / a is larger, making the probability higher. So a planet with a smaller orbital period (Planet_1, since its period is three times shorter) would be closer to its star, so a is smaller, making the transit probability higher.

But wait, the orbital period depends on the star's mass and the semi-major axis. Using Kepler
