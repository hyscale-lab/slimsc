Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give different possibilities for the relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy E.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical velocity addition. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is needed here. I think the formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, or is it (v1 + v2) over 1 plus something? No, wait, in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, I think I subtract their velocities.

Wait, let me get that right. Suppose astronaut A is moving at v1, and astronaut B at v2, both in the same direction. The relative speed of A from B's frame would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Or maybe it's (v2 - v1) divided by something, but since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the smaller from the larger to get the correct positive relative speed.

Wait, no, if I'm in B's frame, I see A moving at v1, but I'm moving at v2 in the same direction. So, the relative speed is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers.

Astronaut A's speed is 0.6c, astronaut B is 0.5c. So, v1 = 0.6c, v2=0.5c.

So relative speed = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Simplifying numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So (0.1c)/0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c, so that's a good sign.

Now, for the total energy. The total energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate gamma for each and sum their energies.

Wait, but wait, the question says the masses are 2m and 3m. Oh, right, so their rest masses are 2m and 3m. So for each, we calculate their relativistic energy and sum them.

So, for the first astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v is 0.6c, so v² is 0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64.
