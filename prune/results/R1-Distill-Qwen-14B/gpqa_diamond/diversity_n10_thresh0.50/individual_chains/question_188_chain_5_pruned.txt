Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... Oh right, a rhombohedron has all edges equal and all angles equal. So it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The interatomic distance, I think, refers to the edge length of the unit cell. Like, a, b, c are all equal, so a = b = c = 10 Angstroms. 

The interplanar distance for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the formula from the Bragg's law, but I think the formula for d-spacing is what I need here. Oh yeah, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - sqrt( ... something with the angles? Wait, I remember that in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but for non-cubic systems like rhombohedral, the formula gets more complicated because of the angles.

Right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = (1/√( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )) ) * something... Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the metric tensor. Or maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ), but I'm not sure about the exact signs and terms.

Wait, wait. Since all angles are 30 degrees and a = b = c, the formula might simplify. Let me look up the exact formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk( cos α + cos α ) )? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is derived from the relations in crystallography. The interplanar distance d for a rhombohedral system (where a = b = c = a0, and angles α = β = γ = θ) is given by:

d^2 = (a0^2) / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos² θ / (1 - cos θ) ) ]

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should consider the Miller indices and the unit cell vectors.

Alternatively, the formula for d in a rhombohedral system can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cos θ (hk + hl + kl) + 2 cos²θ (hk + hl + kl) )
