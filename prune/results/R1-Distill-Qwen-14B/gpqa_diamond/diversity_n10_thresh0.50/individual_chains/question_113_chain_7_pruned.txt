Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying H and O counts. The task is to figure out which formula fits the given data.

First, I'll break down each piece of information and see what they indicate about the structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate hydrogen bonding, which happens in alcohols, carboxylic acids, or maybe something like an ether if there's a broadening for some other reason. But O-H in an alcohol or acid is a strong possibility. The two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 could be a ketone or aldehyde, maybe ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, so maybe it's another carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, or maybe it's an aromatic ring with some conjugation, like a carbonyl in a ring?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond, maybe more. That would contribute to the IR as well. Could the 1650 peak be a conjugated double bond, like in an aromatic ring? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, like in a beta-keto ester or something?

Looking at the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z 45. M/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible ions that sum to 45. For example, the tropylium ion is m/z 91, but wait, no, that's for benzene rings. Wait, m/z 45. Hmm. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment. For example, (CH3)2CO is 5
