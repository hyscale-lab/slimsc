Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So maybe the starting compound has a ketone group?

Let's look at the IR data first. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an -OH stretch, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 2500-3000 as well. There's also a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's probably from a ketone or maybe an ester. Another peak at 1610 cm⁻¹, which could be aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm⁻¹ is maybe another aromatic peak or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Now the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, 1H. That's a good sign for a carboxylic acid proton because they usually appear around 10-12 ppm and are broad. Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a carbonyl from a carboxylic acid as well. Wait, wait, no: carboxylic acids have a very strong, broad peak around 2500–3300 for O-H, and the carbonyl is around 1700. So in this case, the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, maybe a bit higher than a regular acid. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Hmm, but earlier I thought about a ketone because of the Clemmensen reaction.

Wait, but wait, another possibility. Let's think about the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is more typical for an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak, but for the
