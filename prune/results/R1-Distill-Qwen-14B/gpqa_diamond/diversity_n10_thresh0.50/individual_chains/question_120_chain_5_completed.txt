Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean they're spread out evenly in some way? I'm trying to remember what I learned about parallax and how it relates to distance.

Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance to a star (d) is inversely proportional to its parallax (p), so d = 1/p, right? But wait, I think the actual formula uses parsecs. Oh right, parallax p in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance d in parsecs. So p = 1/d, which means d = 1/p.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with p. So if I imagine a range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, how many stars would be in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let me think about volume. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times dr. The surface area is 4πr², so the number of stars would be N = n * 4πd² * dr, where n is the number density.

But since d = 1/p, I can substitute that in. So N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * dr. Wait, but we want to express this in terms of p. Let me think about how dr relates to dp. Since d = 1/p, taking the derivative: dr = - (1/p²) dp. Oh, but since we're considering a small increase in p, the negative just tells us about the direction, but the magnitude is important. So dr = (1/p²) dp.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If p increases, d decreases. So when p increases by dp, the distance changes by dr = negative of (dp * d)/(p^2), but perhaps I should express dr in terms of dp. Let me do that properly.

Given d = 1/p, so dr/dp = -1/p². So dr = -(1/p²) dp. But since the question is about a unit range of parallax, maybe it's better to think in terms of how the number of stars between p and p+dp relates to p.

So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to 4πd² dr. Substituting d=1/p, that becomes 4π (1/p²) * dr. But dr is related to dp. So when p increases by dp, the corresponding dr is -(1/p²) dp. So substituting, we get the number of stars as N ∝ (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, no, because dr is (1/p²) dp, but with the negative sign. But since we're considering a small positive dp, the negative just indicates that d decreases as p increases, but the magnitude is what matters.

So N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that would be (1/p^4) dp. But that doesn't seem right. Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me re-examine.

The volume element in spherical shells is 4πd² dr. So for a given d, the volume element is 4πd² dr. But since dr is in terms of dp, and d=1/p, let me express dr in terms of dp.

So d = 1/p → p = 1/d → dp = - (1/d²) dd. Wait, maybe it's easier to express dr in terms of dp.

Differentiating both sides: dp = - (1/d²) dr → dr = - d² dp. Since d = 1/p, substituting, dr = -(1/p²) dp. So the thickness dr is proportional to dp times 1/p².

So N = n *4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². And dr = -(1/p²) dp. So putting it all together:

N = n *4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) )

But since we're considering a small positive dp, the negative indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but the number of stars in that shell is positive. So,

N = n *4π * (1/p^4) dp

So the number of stars in a thin parallax shell between p and p+dp is proportional to (1/p^4) dp. Therefore, the number per unit range of parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which is probably the number per unit p. So the number of stars in a small range dp is N = const * (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit p is (1/p^4), which means the number density in p space is ~ 1/p^4.

But wait, the options are about how the number changes with p. So for each unit increase in p, the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct option would be A) ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: think about the volume between two distances. Suppose we have two distances, d and d + dd. The volume between them is 4π d² dd. Now, if we express this in terms of parallax p, where p = 1/d, then d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p^2) * (-1/p^2 dp) )= 4π ( -1/p^4 ) dp. The negative indicates decreasing p as d increases, but the magnitude is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this range would be N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is n *4π (1/p^4) → so it's proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit plx (dp) is ~1/p^4, so the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think: the number of stars in a given volume (which depends on distance) would be higher when the volume element is larger. The volume element grows with d^2 * dr. But as p increases (i.e., the star is closer), the volume element (and hence number of stars) increases because for a given dp, the shell's volume is larger when d is smaller (p is larger). Wait, no: when p is larger, d is smaller. For example, if p is 0.01 parsecs, d is 100 parsecs. But if p is 0.02, d is 50 parsecs. The volume element at p=0.01 would be 4pi*(100)^2 * dr, and at p=0.02, 4pi*(50)^2 * dr. So the volume element is smaller for larger p, which would imply fewer stars per unit p.

But according to previous calculation, the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number per unit p decreases. So the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as you go to higher parallax (closer stars), which makes sense because the volume element per unit parallax decreases.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think in terms of how the number of stars in a certain dp range varies with p. Suppose you have two ranges of dp: one at small p, say p=1, and another at p=2. How many stars are in each range?

At p=1, each dp contributes a larger volume than at p=2. For example, for dp=1, at p=1, the volume is 4pi*(1)^2 * (1/1^2) )=4pi. At p=2, dp=1, the volume would be 4pi*(2)^2 * (1/2^2) )=4pi*(4)*(1/4)=4pi. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, when p is 1, d=1. So the volume element for dr is 4pi*d^2 dr. But dr = 1/p^2 dp. So when p=1, dr=1* dp → so volume is 4pi * (1)^2 * (1 * dp) )=4pi dp.

At p=2, d=0.5. dr = 1/(2^2) dp = (1/4) dp. So volume element is 4pi*(0.5)^2 * (1/4) dp) =4pi*(0.25)*(0.25) dp =4pi*(1/16) dp = (pi/4) dp.

Wait, so for the same dp (like 1 unit), the volume element is 4pi dp when p=1, and (pi/4) dp when p=2. So the volume is much smaller at higher p. So the number of stars per unit p would decrease as p increases, which aligns with the 1/p^4 dependence. Because when p increases, 1/p^4 decreases rapidly.

So the correct answer would be option A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax \( p \) and distance \( d \). The parallax formula is \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), meaning \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) multiplied by \( dr \), i.e., \( N \propto 4\pi d^2 dr \).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we have \( d^2 = \frac{1}{p^2} \). The thickness \( dr \) can be expressed in terms of \( dp \) using the derivative \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars in a thin parallax shell between \( p \) and \( p + dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} dp \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( dp \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

As \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases rapidly due to the \( \frac{1}{p^4} \) dependence. This aligns with the fact that the volume element \( 4\pi d^2 dr \) decreases as \( p \) increases, leading to fewer stars in closer ranges of parallax.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
