Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So I think S is actually the Pauli Y matrix scaled somehow. Wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which matches S here. Oh wait, no, wait, Pauli matrices are usually Y = [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so yeah, S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix.

So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. But wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so that makes sense because the problem is dealing with 2x2 matrices.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and which statement is correct during that calculation. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

So first, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's compute Ay first. Since Ay = c·S, and S is [[
