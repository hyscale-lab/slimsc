Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let's see. The question has two parts, each involving a reaction. I need to find out what reagents A and B are from the options provided.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's often some kind of substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, if I add NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, to a ketone, what happens?

Oh wait, I think this is a nucleophilic addition. The ketone has a carbonyl group, which is electrophilic. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, after the attack, the oxygen would have a negative charge, right? So then I think it would pick up a proton. But under what conditions?

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's a hydroxy group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons. Let me see: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be something like CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's a secondary alcohol adjacent to the nitrile. So for the first reaction, the ketone reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps? Because NaCN is a good nucleophile, but maybe the reaction requires some acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic.

Wait, no. Wait, in the presence of acid, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic because the O gets protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more positive. So that would make the attack by CN- easier. So maybe reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B) or something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a CN- addition to the ketone, followed by some workup. So butan-2-one plus NaCN in acidic conditions. I think that's right. So the first reagent A is H3O+.

But wait, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, and C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. So what's the difference?

Wait, another possibility: sometimes when you have a nitrile addition, like in the case of the cyanohydrin formation. Oh yeah! I think that's right. The reaction of a ketone with HCN (or in this case, NaCN and acid) forms a cyanohydrin. So the product is the cyanohydrin.

So the reaction is: ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst. So the reagent A would be H3O+, so either option A or B, since they have A as H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And the reagent B (with H2O) produces 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think: hydrolysis of nitriles can be done with HCl and water, or with H2SO4 and H2O, or maybe using other acids.

Wait, the typical conditions for nitrile to carboxylic acid is using HCl (like in HCl with H2O and heat). Or sometimes using H2SO4 as a catalyst. So in this case, reagent B is used with H2O to produce the acid.

So the options for B are looking at what's in the options. Let's see the options again.

Option A: B = HCl.
Option B: B = CH3COOH.
Option C: B = HCl.
Option D: B = CH3COOH.

Wait, in the second reaction, the reagent B is used with H2O. So if the reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, then the conditions are usually strong acid and heat. So HCl (option A and C) or maybe concentrated H2SO4.

Wait, but in the options, the possible B reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl again, and CH3COOH. So which is correct?

Wait, another thought: hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under acidic conditions. The reaction is: RCN + H2O → RCOOH. The reagents are typically HCl (as a catalyst) and heat. So the B reagent would be HCl as a catalyst.

Looking at the options, options A and C have B as HCl. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A or B). Then, in the second reaction, B is HCl (so options A or C).

So putting it together: first reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B). Second reagent B is HCl (so options A or C). So the only overlapping option would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another possibility? For the first reaction, could A be NaHSO3?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What does that do? Oh, wait, sometimes when you have a ketone, you can do a bisulfite addition, but that's more for aldehydes and ketones reacting to form the bisulfite adduct, which upon workup gives diols or something else, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is not a cyanohydrin formation but something else. Wait, but the product is a cyanohydrin, so yes, acid is needed. So A is H3O+.

So the first reaction uses H3O+ (so options A or B). The second reaction uses HCl (so options A or C). So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me check the second reaction again. The product is a carboxylic acid. Another way to make a carboxylic acid from nitrile is hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions, like HCl in water, or maybe using a strong acid like concentrated H2SO4. But in the options, A is H3O+ (which is a weak acid?), and B is HCl.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+ (so maybe it's just an acid to catalyze the addition of CN-). So that would point to option A or B for the first part.

So for the second reaction, when you have a nitrile, to get to a carboxylic acid, you can use HCl in aqueous solution with heat. So the reagent B would be HCl. Hence, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Alternatively, if B is HCl, then option A matches. So the answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the CN⁻ ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. Acidic conditions are typically required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and facilitating the reaction. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺, which acts as an acid catalyst.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl in water, to facilitate the reaction. Thus, reagent B is likely HCl.

From the options provided:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  

Reagent A must be H₃O⁺ (eliminating options C and D), and reagent B must be HCl (eliminating option B). Therefore, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
