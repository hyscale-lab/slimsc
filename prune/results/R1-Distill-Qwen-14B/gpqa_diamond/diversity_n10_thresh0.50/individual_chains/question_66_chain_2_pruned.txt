Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory framework used when you have new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), and you can describe the effects of that new physics with higher-dimensional operators. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact symmetries involved.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, wait. Let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all reference frames moving at constant velocities relative to each other. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, right? Because Poincaré group is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if a theory respects Poincaré symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. But does SMEFT require Poincaré symmetry?

Wait, but wait. The Standard Model itself is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but not all its extensions are necessarily Poincaré invariant. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. No, I think the SM is Poincaré-invariant because it's a relativistic theory with local symmetries. So when you write SMEFT, you have to maintain the same symmetries as the SM. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. But wait, do they also have to be Poincaré invariant? Because Poincaré includes translations, which means the theory must
