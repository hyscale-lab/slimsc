Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, like per unit distance r.

First, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance. Oh wait, wait, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 parsec divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So distance d is inversely proportional to parallax. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So the formula given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in would give N proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. Oh wait, let me make sure. Let me write that out.

plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx

So replacing plx in the equation: N = k * (plx)^(-5) → N = k * (1/d)^(-5) → N = k * d^5.

Wait, so N is proportional to d^5. But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm. So that's like the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr. So the number per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So for a given region of the sky, when parallax is small (which is when distance is large), the number of stars increases. But wait, no, because when plx is small, 1/plx^5 is large. So higher number of stars when plx is smaller, which is when d is larger. So more stars at larger distances? That seems a bit counterintuitive because normally, in the universe, the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance because there are more stars nearby. But this is a specific region where the number varies differently. So perhaps in this region, the density increases with distance.

Wait, but the question is about the number as a function of distance. So N ∝ d^5. So if d increases, N increases as d^5. So for a given distance range, say from d to d+dr, the number of stars in that shell would be related to how N changes with d.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So maybe it's asking for dN/dr, the rate of change of number with distance. So dN/dr = derivative of N with respect to d.

If N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd = 5*d^4. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4, where r is distance. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

Wait, but the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

So the rate of change, the number per unit distance, would go as r^4, so option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance again. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and the formula is plx = 1/d (in parsecs). So d=1/plx.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5, so substituting d=1/plx, we get N = k*(d)^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. So if we imagine a thin shell at distance d, the number of stars in that shell would be 4π d² * (density). Hmm, but wait, perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, if we have N as a function of d, like for a certain volume, then the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr would be N = (density) * 4π d² dr. But in this case, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number is N = k / plx^5, which is N = k d^5.

Wait, but if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dr would be the difference N(d+dr) - N(d) ≈ dN/dr * dr = 5 k d^4 dr. So the number per unit dr (dN/dr) would be 5 k d^4, which is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (per dr) increases as r^4. So the correct answer would be option C: ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the given relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as \( d^5 \) with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To find this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance (\( \frac{dN}{dr} \)) is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
