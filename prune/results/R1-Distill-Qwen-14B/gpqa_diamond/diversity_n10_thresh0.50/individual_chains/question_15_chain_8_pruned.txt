Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, and I need to figure out which one has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about the transit method.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us because then it has a higher chance of passing in front of the star. But wait, how do we calculate that probability?

I remember that the probability (P) of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = R_star / a_orb, where R_star is the radius of the star and a_orb is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I might be mixing some terms here. Another thought: actually, the formula I'm thinking of is the geometric probability, which is roughly (R_star / (a_orb * sin i)), where i is the inclination angle. But since we don't know the inclination, maybe it's the average probability. Oh right, the average probability is (R_star / (a_orb)) multiplied by some factor. Wait, let me get this straight.

The transit probability (P) can be approximated as (R_star / a_orb) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So P is approximately R_star / a_orb.

Wait, but wait, that's not exactly right. Because another factor comes into play. I think the correct probability is (R_star / a_orb) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a_orb)^2))), but that's for the transit depth. No, maybe I'm confusing it. Let me think again.

No, the geometric probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it transits the star. This probability is (R_star / a_orb) * ( (a_orb) / (sqrt(a_orb² - R_star²)) ) )? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet. Because the planet has to be in the right part of its orbit when it's viewed edge-on.

Wait, another approach: the probability of a transit is equal to the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block, but I think that's more about the transit depth, not the probability of the transit happening.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Oh, I can't look it up, but I know that the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a_orb) * something. But since the planets are Earth-like and the stars are much larger, the planet's radius is negligible compared to the star. So, I can ignore R_planet.

So, the transit probability is approximately P = (R_star) / (a_orb) * (1 / (1 - (R_star / a_orb)^2 )^(1/2) ) )? Or maybe it's (R_star / a_orb) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps another way to think about it: the transit probability is the ratio of the star
