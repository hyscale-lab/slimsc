Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. So the question is essentially asking which theory doesn't have these kinds of problems even when energy scales are high.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. I think that's the theory of electricity and magnetism as described by Maxwell's equations. Classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, so they don't have the same divergences that quantum theories do. But wait, classical theories can have their own issues, like the problem of self-energy in point charges leading to infinite charge densities. Oh right, in classical electromagnetism, when you consider point particles, you get issues like infinite self-energy because the electric field of a point charge is too strong at close distances. So even classical theories can have problems, but they aren't solved using regularization and renormalization like in quantum theories. So would the question consider that as 'requiring regularization'? Probably not, because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So maybe option D doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know that QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. It's known for having loop corrections which can lead to divergent integrals. For example, the calculation of the electron's self-energy has divergences. These are handled using regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization. So option C is not the correct answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. QCD deals with quarks and gluons. It's a non-abelian gauge theory and it has something called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies. But when you do calculations, like loop diagrams, you still get divergences. So QCD definitely requires regularization as part of the process to handle these infinities. So option B is out.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I'm a bit rusty on string theory details. From what I recall, string theories aim to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity by describing particles as strings. One of the key features is that they don't have the same kind of divergences as in quantum field theories. Or wait, do they? Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, not point particles, which might help avoid some of the divergences. Also, superstring theory incorporates supersymmetry, which might help with some divergences. But wait, I thought that even string theories sometimes require certain kinds of regularization, like through the use of conformal field theories or other methods. Or maybe they don't require it because the underlying framework is different. Another point I remember is that string theories predict the same effective gravitational constant as in general relativity when considering different energy scales, which suggests they might not have the same loop divergences as in QFT. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I've heard that in string theory
