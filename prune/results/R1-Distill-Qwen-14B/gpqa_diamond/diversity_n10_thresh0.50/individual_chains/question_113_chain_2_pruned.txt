Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using spectroscopy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece it all together.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests there are -OH groups, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but a broad peak could also be from an amide, but that's less likely here. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, which makes me think it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretching or maybe an amide. But considering the presence of a broad peak around 3000, maybe it's something like a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone with some conjugation?

Moving on to the 1H NMR. There are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are in double bonds, so that suggests the compound has a C=C bond. So the structure probably has both carbonyl groups and double bonds.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. What fragments give 45? Let's think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2- or maybe something else. Wait, 45 is (CH2O) which is 30, no, wait, 12+2+16 =30? No, maybe it's (CH3)CO, but that's 58. Hmm. Another approach: 45 could be the molecular ion of a small molecule. For example, CH2CH2O? Not sure. Or maybe a ketene? Or perhaps the fragment is a carbonyl-containing group. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2O, but that's 30 again. Wait, maybe it's a methyl ester or some other group. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment that corresponds to a specific functional group.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12
