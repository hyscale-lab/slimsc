Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model, for a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have atoms connected by a bond, and their motion can be modeled in terms of rotation and vibration. 

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that's absorbed so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. Oh wait, fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state must be the first excited state.

The given data includes the masses of atoms X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are A to D, each with a different momentum value.

Wait, the molecule's energy levels depend on both rotation and vibration. So when a photon is absorbed, does it cause a transition in rotation, vibration, or both? I think the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the quantum numbers for rotation and vibration might change.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, it's similar to the harmonic oscillator, where E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, with n being the vibrational quantum number.

So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational parts. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy, which would have J=0 (lowest rotational state) and n=0 (lowest vibrational state). So E_total_initial = E_rot(J=0) + E_vib(n=0) = 0 + (1/2) h w.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state. The next lowest energy would probably involve either increasing J or n. But which transition is lower in energy? Because the vibrational energy levels have a larger spacing compared to rotations. So the next state would likely involve a change in J, not n, because that may require less energy. Or wait, it depends on the energies involved.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That suggests the smallest possible increase in energy. So the minimal energy jump. So maybe the photon causes a transition in the rotational state, because the vibrational transitions are usually higher energy (
