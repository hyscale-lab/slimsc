Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, right?

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance of P from the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in conductors, charges redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so all the charge must come from somewhere else. Oh wait, no, the problem says 'a small amount of positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity'â€”so maybe the conductor itself remains neutral? Or does it somehow affect the charges?

Wait, I think when a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an equal and opposite charge. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the
