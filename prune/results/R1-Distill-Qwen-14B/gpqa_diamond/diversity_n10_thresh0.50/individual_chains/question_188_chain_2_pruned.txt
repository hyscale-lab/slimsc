Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices. Let's think about what I know.

First, the crystal is rhombohedral. I think a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles the same, right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms in the lattice, which in a cubic system might be the edge length. But rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

The angles here are all 30 degrees. So alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. That's a pretty sharp angle. I'm trying to recall the formula for interplanar distance. Oh, right! The formula is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos β/(a^2)) - 2(hl cos γ/(a^2)) - 2(kl cos α/(a^2)) } ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (but in rhombohedral, a = b = c, right?), and angles between them, is something else.

Wait, wait. For a rhombohedral system, because a =
