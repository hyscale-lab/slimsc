Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I have to find the final product from the options given. Hmm, alright, let me take it slowly.

First, let me look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Breaking that down, the molecular formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, that's interesting because the nitrogen suggests maybe an amine or an amide or something like that. But given the NMR data, I should probably figure out the structure first.

The NMR data is given as:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each peak. Starting with the higher ppm values. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so I'm thinking it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes other deshielded protons could be that high, but aldehyde is a common one. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

But wait, the aldehyde would typically be a singlet, right? Because there's only one proton. Oh wait, but in this case, it's a triplet with 1H. Hmm, that might mean that the aldehyde proton is next to some other protons. Or perhaps it's not an aldehyde. Maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl, but that's more in the 2-3 ppm range. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause a high shift. Or wait, could it be an enol or something else?

Wait, another possibility: the 9.72 could be an exchange broadened peak, but it's a triplet. Maybe it's an aldehyde but coupled with two equivalent protons. So, in an aldehyde group adjacent to a CH2 group? Like, maybe CH2CHO. So the aldehyde proton is next to two protons, making it a triplet. Because each of the two protons on CH2 would split the aldehyde proton into a triplet. That makes sense. So if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group, that would explain the triplet. So the structure might have a CH2CHO group.

Looking at the next peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each for 2H. Those are likely aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted rings. For example, two doublets in the aromatic region could suggest two sets of two equivalent protons, perhaps in para positions. Maybe something like two phenyl groups attached to the molecule.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons: if there's a benzene ring, that's 6 carbons
