Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So the structure is (CH3)2C=O. When this reacts with NaCN, that's probably some kind of nucleophilic addition. Because ketones can undergo nucleophilic additions, like with something like HCN maybe. But NaCN would provide the CN- ion as a nucleophile.

Wait, but wait, butan-2-one plus NaCN... I think that's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN- in a suitable base or acid?) to form a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -OH group and a -CN group. So the product would have both an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon, right?

So in this case, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with CN- would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, butan
