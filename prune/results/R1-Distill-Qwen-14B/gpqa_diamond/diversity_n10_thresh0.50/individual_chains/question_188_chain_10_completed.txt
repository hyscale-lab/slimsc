Okay, I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let me think. So the question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The given parameters are the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The options are A to D, various numbers around 9-10.

Wait, wait, first, I need to recall what a rhombohedral crystal is. Rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. It's a type of hexagonal crystal, right? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh, rhombohedral is a special case where all the edges are equal and all the angles are the same. So it's like a cube that's been deformed so all the angles are equal but not 90 degrees. So in that case, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, with angles alpha=beta=gamma. That makes sense.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, does that refer to the lattice parameter a? Because in a crystal, the interatomic distance could vary depending on the structure, but in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a would be the interatomic distance. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance could be different because of the angles. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify that.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a simple cubic structure is a√1. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. Because in a rhombohedral lattice, each atom is at the corners of a rhombohedral unit cell, so the edges are a, and the nearest neighbors would be along the edges, so distance a. So in this problem, perhaps a is 10 Angstroms? Because that's the interatomic distance. So a = 10 Angstroms. That's a key point.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal. The formula I remember for interplanar distance (d_hkl) is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )) )

Wait, no, wait. For a general triclinic crystal, the formula is more complicated. But rhombohedral is a special case where alpha = beta = gamma. So maybe there's a simplified formula for that.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles alpha, beta, gamma, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(sin² beta sin² gamma / (sin² alpha)) ) + ... Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me think again.

Oh wait, I think the correct formula for d_{hkl} in a triclinic system is:

d² = [ (a² b² c²) / ( (h k l)·(A B C) ) ) ] ... Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to use the formula involving the Miller indices and the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, perhaps the better way is to use the formula:

d = [ (a² + b² + c² - 2ab cos gamma - 2ac cos beta - 2bc cos alpha) / (h² + k² + l²) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The interplanar distance formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles between them (alpha, beta, gamma) is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ ( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) ) + ( terms involving cosines of angles ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should refer to the general formula. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l²) + (k²/m²) + (l²/n²) + ... ) )

Wait, no, that's not it. Let me recall from my notes.

The correct formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d^2 = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / [ (h^2 b^2 c^2 sin^2 alpha + k^2 a^2 c^2 sin^2 beta + l^2 a^2 b^2 sin^2 gamma) + 2 h k a b c (b c cos alpha - a c cos beta - a b cos gamma) ) ]

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I can find a simpler expression when the crystal is rhombohedral, so a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta.

In this problem, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So substituting into the formula, since a = b = c, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So let's try to derive the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral lattice.

The general formula for interplanar distance is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2/(a^2)) + (k^2/(b^2)) + (l^2/(c^2)) - 2 hk (cos gamma) / (a b) - 2 hl (cos beta) / (a c) - 2 kl (cos alpha) / (b c) )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (b c sin alpha)^2 + k^2 (a c sin beta)^2 + l^2 (a b sin gamma)^2 + 2 h k a b c sin alpha sin beta cos gamma + 2 h l a b c sin alpha sin gamma cos beta + 2 k l a b c sin beta sin gamma cos alpha )) / (a^2 b^2 c^2) )

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula derived from the Miller indices.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

In crystallography, the metric tensor is defined by the lattice vectors. For a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice vectors are a, a, a, but with angles between them of 30 degrees each. So the metric tensor (g) is a 3x3 matrix where:

g_11 = a^2

g_22 = a^2

g_33 = a^2

g_12 = g_21 = a^2 cos gamma (since the angle between a1 and a2 is gamma)

Similarly, g_13 = g_31 = a^2 cos beta, and g_23 = g_32 = a^2 cos alpha.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same (alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees), so g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = a^2 * cos(30 degrees).

So the metric tensor is:

[ a²       a² cos30   a² cos30 ]

[ a² cos30   a²         a² cos30 ]

[ a² cos30  a² cos30     a²      ]

Now, the reciprocal metric tensor (g^(-1)) is used to find the interplanar distance. The relation is:

d² = (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) ) / ( (h^2 (sin beta sin gamma)^2 + k^2 (sin alpha sin gamma)^2 + l^2 (sin alpha sin beta)^2 ) + 2 h k (sin alpha sin beta cos gamma) + 2 h l (sin alpha sin gamma cos beta) + 2 k l (sin beta sin gamma cos alpha) ) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) / (a^2) - 2 hk cos(180 - gamma) / a^2 - 2 hl cos(180 - beta) / a^2 - 2 kl cos(180 - alpha) / a^2 )

Wait, because in the metric tensor, the angles between the lattice vectors are the internal angles, but when considering the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors, it's 180 minus the internal angle.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for d in terms of the metric tensor.

The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( h² g_33 + k² g_22 + l² g_11 - 2 hk g_23 - 2 hl g_31 - 2 kl g_32 ) / (a^2 b^2 c^2 sqrt(...)) )

Hmm, maybe I should approach it another way. Using the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I found a formula online before, but I can't access it now. Let me think.

In a rhombohedral system, if a is the lattice parameter, and alpha is the angle between the lattice vectors (which is 30 degrees here), then the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

Wait, wait, is that correct? Let me see. In a cubic system, where alpha=90 degrees, this would reduce to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct for cubic. So this formula might be correct for rhombohedral.

Wait, but wait, in cubic, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). So if alpha is 30 degrees, then the denominator should have a term adjusted by the cos(alpha) for the angles between the planes.

So, for rhombohedral, the formula would be:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

In this problem, h = k = l = 1 for the (111) plane.

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, and alpha=30 degrees.

So denominator becomes sqrt( 1+1+1 - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)*cos(30) )

Compute that:

sum = 3 - 2*(3) * cos(30)

cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2*3 =6. So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So sum inside sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because sqrt of negative is impossible. So this can't be the correct formula. So perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me go back to the drawing board.

Alternative approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system.

In the rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case of the hexagonal system? Or perhaps it's better to consider it as a special case of the triclinic system where a=b=c and alpha=beta=gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral lattice.

The general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors, i.e., alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees in this problem.

Wait, wait, because in the case of a cubic system (theta=90), cos(theta)=0, so d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which is correct.

So let me try this formula with the given values.

h=1, k=1, l=1, theta=30 degrees. cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator is sqrt( 1+1+1 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * 0.866 )

Compute:

Sum = 3 + 2*3 * 0.866 = 3 + 6 * 0.866.

6 * 0.866 = 5.196.

So sum is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d = a / 2.864.

Given a=10 Angstroms, d=10 /2.864 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But wait, none of the options are close to 3.5. The options are around 9-10.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula when the lattice is rhombohedral is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But let's plug in the numbers again.

h=k=l=1, theta=30.

Denominator sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*cos(30)).

cos(30)= ~0.866.

So 3 - 2*(3)*0.866 = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Negative again. Impossible. So that can't be right.

So perhaps I messed up the sign. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Then denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.866 ) = sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)= ~2.864.

Again, 10/2.864≈3.49, which doesn't match any options. So I'm definitely doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal of that. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula altogether.

Alternative idea: the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but then with theta=30, that gives d=10/sqrt(3+6*(0.866))= as before, which gives 3.49. Still not matching the options.

Wait, maybe the formula should have minus 2... but then we get negative.

Hmm. I must be using the wrong formula. Let me think of another approach.

In the case of a simple cubic system (theta=90), the interplanar distance for (111) is a/sqrt(3). So if a=10, d=10/sqrt(3)≈5.773. Still not matching the options.

Wait, but wait, the question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell volume and the area of the (111) plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the definition of the interatomic distance. Maybe the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighboring atoms. For a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of the rhombohedral unit cell. So the nearest neighbor distance is along the edge, so a. So a=10 Angstroms.

Wait, but perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length, but in a different structure. Maybe I'm confusing different terms.

Wait, let's think. In a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2/2, but that's not the case here because the problem states it's a rhombohedral crystal.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to find another approach.

Another formula I remember is that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) )

Wait, that's the same as what I tried earlier, which gave me 3.49 Angstroms, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the supplementary angle? Because in the metric tensor, the angles between the reciprocal vectors are 180 - alpha. So maybe when calculating, we should use cos(180 - theta) instead.

So cos(180 -30) = -cos(30) = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So then, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-0.866)).

Compute 2*3=6, 6*(-0.866)= -5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196. Again, negative. So that's not helping.

Hmm. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think of the general formula for interplanar distance.

The general formula is:

1/d^2 = (h^2 (b^2 c^2 sin^2 alpha) + k^2 (a^2 c^2 sin^2 beta) + l^2 (a^2 b^2 sin^2 gamma)) / (a^2 b^2 c^2) ) + ( 2 h k a b c sin alpha sin beta cos gamma )/(a^2 b^2 c^2) ) + ( 2 h l a b c sin alpha sin gamma cos beta )/(a^2 b^2 c^2 )) + ( 2 k l a b c sin beta sin gamma cos alpha )/(a^2 b^2 c^2 )) )

Wait, that's getting too complicated. Maybe let me factor out 1/(a² b² c²) from all terms.

So,

1/d² = [ h² (b² c² sin² alpha) + k² (a² c² sin² beta) + l² (a² b² sin² gamma) + 2 h k a b c sin alpha sin beta cos gamma + 2 h l a b c sin alpha sin gamma cos beta + 2 k l a b c sin beta sin gamma cos alpha ] / (a² b² c² )

But in rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So substituting a = b = c = a0, and all angles =30 degrees.

So sin(30)=0.5, cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

Now the numerator becomes:

h² (a0^2 * a0^2 * (0.5)^2 ) + k² (a0^2 * a0^2 *(0.5)^2 ) + l^2 (a0^2 * a0^2 *(0.5)^2 ) + 2 h k a0 a0 a0 (0.5)(0.5) cos(30) + same for the other cross terms.

Wait, let's compute each term:

Term 1: h² (a0^4 * 0.25)
Term 2: k² (a0^4 * 0.25)
Term3: l² (a0^4 * 0.25)
Term4: 2 h k a0^3 (0.25) (0.866)
Term5: same as term4 for h l
Term6: same as term4 for k l.

So summing terms:

Each term4,5,6 has 2 h k a0^3 *0.25 * 0.866.

Wait, but a0=10 Angstroms, but let me proceed symbolically.

So, all terms:

= a0^4 [ 0.25 (h² + k² + l²) ) + 2 h k * a0^{-1} * (0.25 * 0.866) * a0^3 ]

Wait, perhaps not. Let me compute each term.

Term1: h² a0^4 (0.25)
Term2: k² a0^4 (0.25)
Term3: l² a0^4 (0.25)
Term4: 2 h k a0^3 (0.5 * 0.5) (0.866) ) → 2 h k a0^3 (0.25) (0.866) → 0.5 h k a0^3 (0.866)
Similarly, term5: 0.5 h l a0^3 (0.866)
Term6: 0.5 k l a0^3 (0.866)

So the numerator becomes:

a0^4 [ 0.25 (h² +k² + l²) ] + a0^3 [ 0.5 *0.866 ( h k + h l + k l ) ]

Denominator is a0^6.

So 1/d² = [ ... ] / a0^6

So, factor out a0^3:

= [ a0^3 ( 0.25 a0 (h² +k² + l²) + 0.5 *0.866 (h k + h l +k l) ) ) ] / a0^6

= [ 0.25 a0 (h² +k² + l²) + 0.5 *0.866 (h k + h l +k l) ) ] / a0^3

Thus,

1/d² = [ 0.25 (h² +k² + l²) + 0.5 *0.866 (h k + h l +k l) ) ] / a0²

So,

d² = a0² / [ 0.25 (h² +k² + l²) + 0.5*0.866*(h k + h l +k l) ) ]

Given that a0=10 Angstroms, and for (111) h=k=l=1:

Compute denominator:

0.25*(3) + 0.5*0.866*(3) → 0.75 + 0.5 *0.866 *3.

0.5 *3=1.5; 1.5 *0.866 ≈1.299.

So denominator= 0.75 +1.299 ≈2.049.

So,

d² = 10² / 2.049 = 100 /2.049 ≈48.82.

Then d= sqrt(48.82) ≈6.987 Angstroms.

But wait, none of the options are near 7. So I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I did the wrong substitution. Let me recalculate the denominator.

Wait, let's compute each part again.

h=k=l=1, so:

h² +k² + l² =1+1+1=3.

h k + h l +k l =1*1 +1*1 +1*1=3.

So,

0.25*(3) =0.75.

0.5 *0.866 *3 =0.5 *2.598 ≈1.299.

So denominator=0.75 +1.299=2.049.

So 100/2.049≈48.82 → d≈6.987.

But options are all around 9.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative idea: Maybe the formula I used isn't correct.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 - theta) )

Because theta is the angle between the lattice vectors, but the angles in the reciprocal space are 180-theta.

Wait, cos(180-theta) = -cos(theta).

So,

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (-cos(theta)) )

= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which is the same formula as before. So same result as before, which gives about 3.49 Angstroms.

But that's not matching the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell volume.

The volume V of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos(theta)^2 + 2 cos^3(theta) )

But perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, the area of the (111) plane can be found using the vectors in the plane.

Wait, another method. The (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice is spanned by vectors:

a1 + a2, a1 + a3, a2 + a3.

Wait, no, perhaps the Miller indices are hkl=111, so the plane is defined by the intercepts at (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a).

Wait, in a cubic system, the (111) plane is easy. But in rhombohedral, it's more complex because of the angles.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The distance from the origin to the plane is d, and the equation of the plane is (1)(x/a) + (1)(y/a) + (1)(z/a) = 1, where a is the lattice parameter.

Wait, but in a cubic system, yes. But in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is not cubic, so the equation is more complex.

Wait, the general equation for a plane in a crystal is (h (x/a) + k (y/b) cos alpha + l (z/c) cos beta ) + ... Hmm, maybe I'm getting too stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Upon some quick thinking, the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta) )

Wait, but that can't be right because if theta=90, cos(theta)=0, which would give d= a/sqrt(h² +k² +l² ), correct for cubic.

But if theta=30, cos(theta)=√3/2≈0.866.

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(3) *0.866 )= sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)≈2.864.

d=10/2.864≈3.49, which again is not among the options.

Wait, this can't be right because the options are much larger.

Wait, maybe I inverted the formula. Maybe it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which in this case:

Denominator sqrt(3 - 6*(0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

But with alpha=30, cos(alpha)=0.866.

So denominator sqrt(3 -6*0.866)=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.

Hmm. Maybe the formula uses the reciprocal? Or perhaps the formula for d is  a/sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) / (1 + cos(theta)) )

Wait, that would be, for (111), denominator sqrt(3/(1+0.866))= sqrt(3/(1.866))≈sqrt(1.606)≈1.268. So d=10/1.268≈7.88 Angstroms. Close to option C (9.54), but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) )

But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k^2 + l^2) ) / (sqrt( something )).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But that gives negative denominator.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. The given options are all around 9 Angstroms. The interatomic distance is 10. So for a (111) plane, perhaps the interplanar distance is larger than a, which would imply that the denominator is less than 1. But in the cubic case, the (111) plane has d = a/sqrt(3) ≈5.77 when a=10. So 5.77 is less than a. But the options suggest a larger d.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think, if the formula I used earlier gives d=3.49, but the options are around 9, perhaps I should take the reciprocal of that, which is ~ 2.864. No, that's not making sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which, for (111), denominator would be sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d=10 *2.864=28.64. That's way off, so no.

Wait another approach: Perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) / a^2.

Wait, then for (111):

1/d²= (3)/(10^2) - 2*(3)*cos(30)/(10^2)

= (3/100) - (6 * 0.866)/100.

= (3 -5.196)/100 = (-2.196)/100.

Which is negative, so impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / sqrt( something else )

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the area of the plane.

Wait, the area of the (111) plane can be found from the vectors in the plane. The vectors would be a1 + a2, a1 + a3, etc., but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the interplanar distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. But that would give 10, which is option D. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are A:9.08, B:8.95, C:9.54, D:10.05.

If the correct answer is around 9.5, which is option C, then perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But when theta=30, cos(theta)=0.866.

So for (111):

Denominator sqrt(3 -6*0.866)=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196) → impossible.

So, perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the angles are 60 degrees, and not 30. Wait, no, the question states 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But when theta=30 degrees, this would give negative, which isn't possible. So perhaps I should take the absolute value, but that's not a standard approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a hexagonal crystal instead. But the problem states it's a rhombohedral crystal.

Hmm, maybe I should think of a rhombohedral system as a special case of a hexagonal system. In hexagonal, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is given by d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² + l² - hk) )) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, for a hexagonal system, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( 4 h² + h² +k² + l² - 2 h k - 2 h l )

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the plane.

The Miller indices are (111), so the plane is defined by the equation 1x +1y +1z = d'. The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the reciprocals multiplied by some factors.

Wait, perhaps using the formula:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2 (hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2 (hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2 (kl cos alpha)/(b c) )

But in rhombohedral, a=b=c=10, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So,

d = 1 / sqrt( (1/10)^2 + (1/10)^2 + (1/10)^2 - 2*(1*1 cos30)/(10*10) *3 )

Wait,

Each term:

(1/10)^2 = 0.01.

So sum of three: 0.03.

Now, the cross terms:

2*(1*1 cos30)/(10*10) = 2*(0.866)/100 = 0.01732.

There are three such terms (hk, hl, kl), so 3 *0.01732=0.05196.

So,

d = 1 / sqrt( 0.03 - 0.05196 )

= 1 / sqrt( -0.02196 )

Again, negative. So this can't be right.

Hmm. I must have made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the signs are opposite.

Wait, in the formula, the cross terms are subtracted. So the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( sum(h²/a²) - 2 sum( h k cos(theta) / (a^2) ) )

So,

sum terms: 3*(1/10^2) = 0.03.

sum cross terms: 3 * [ 2*(1*1 * cos30)/(10^2) ] → 3 * [ 2*(0.866)/100 ] → 3*(0.01732)=0.05196.

So,

d = 1 / sqrt( 0.03 - 0.05196) → same as before, negative.

So the formula can't be correct.

I think I'm stuck here. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Maybe using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is given by:

V = a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3 cos^2(theta) + 2 cos^3(theta) )

With theta=30 degrees, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So,

V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

3*(0.75) = 2.25.

2*(0.866)^3=2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So,

1 -2.25 +1.299= (1 -2.25) = -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So,

V=1000 * sqrt(0.049)=1000 * 0.221≈221 Angstrom^3.

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, the area of the (111) plane is given by (a^2)/(sqrt( ... )) ?

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )) )

But again, theta=30 so cos(theta)=0.866.

But denominator becomes sqrt(3 -6*0.866)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

I'm really stuck. Since none of the formulas I'm trying are giving me a plausible answer, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) * sqrt( (1 - cos(theta)) ) )

But let's test that.

For (111), sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - cos30) = sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - 0.866) = sqrt(3)*sqrt(0.134) ≈1.732 * 0.366≈0.634.

So d=10/0.634≈15.76. Not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply a, which is 10 Angstroms. That's option D.

But why would the interplanar distance be the same as the interatomic distance? That seems unlikely, but perhaps in this specific case, due to the angles, it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the (111) plane is the same as the unit cell edge, so d= a=10. But that's option D.

But I'm not confident. Since none of the other approaches are working, perhaps option C is the right one.

Wait, in the formula I used earlier, when I calculated d≈6.987, but maybe I made a mistake in that calculation. Let me recheck.

In the previous approach, after substituting, I got d≈6.987.

Wait, but the options are 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05. These are all larger than a, which is 10. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But with theta=30, cos(theta)=0.866.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6 * 0.866 )

= 10 / sqrt(3 -5.196 ) = 10 / sqrt( -2.196 )

Impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angle of 150 degrees instead of 30 degrees, because 180-30=150.

So cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 +6 *0.866 )

=10 / sqrt( 3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.864≈3.49. Still no match.

Hmm. Maybe the formula is wrong, and perhaps the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) (sqrt(3)/2) )

But I'm making this up as I go, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the lattice spacing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are h, k, l. The interplanar distance is 1/|G|, where G is the vector sum h a^* +k b^* + l c^*.

Wait, but without knowing the exact form of the reciprocal vectors, it's hard to proceed.

Another thought: Perhaps the correct approach is to compute the unit cell volume and use that to compute the interplanar distance.

But I don't see a direct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would give d=10/sqrt(3+6*(0.866))=10/2.864≈3.49.

But I'm stuck because this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but something else. Maybe the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral structure is a√(something).

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√( function of theta).

Hmm. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2.

But in a rhombohedral with theta=30, what is the nearest neighbor distance?

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance along the edges is a, so the given interatomic distance is a=10. So I think my initial assumption was correct.

But then why am I not getting any of the options as the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the (111) plane is not the same as the nearest neighbor direction. Wait, the (111) plane is not along the edges; it's a diagonal plane.

Hmm. Maybe the interplanar distance is larger than a.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Since I'm not getting anywhere, perhaps I should look for the formula for the interplanar distance of (111) in a rhombohedral system with a=10 and theta=30 degrees.

Suppose I'm not recalling the formula correctly. Another way is to think about the unit vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the three lattice vectors are a, a, a, each with angles of 30 degrees between them.

The (111) plane has a normal vector (1,1,1). The distance from the origin to the plane is d.

The equation of the plane is 1*(x) +1*(y) +1*(z) = d.

But in terms of the unit vectors, which have angles, the actual coordinates are a bit more complex.

Wait, no. The actual coordinates are in terms of the rhombohedral axes. So the unit vectors are not orthogonal.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance using the reciprocal vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) ( cos(theta) sin(theta) ) etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing.

Alternatively, the distance from the origin to the (111) plane can be found using the formula:

d = 1 / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ) )

Wait, but that brings me back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But again, that would give negative for (111).

Hmm. Since I'm not making progress, and the options are all around 9.5, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstroms.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(3 +6*0.866)=10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.864≈28.64. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But that gives a negative denominator.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: Use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Assuming theta=30 degrees. For (111):

Denominator= sqrt(3 -6 *0.866)=sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.

Wait, maybe I should compute this as a complex number, but that doesn't make physical sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angle of 60 degrees instead of 30, but the question says 30. So that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell, but in reality, the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is a multiplied by some factor due to the angles.

Wait, for example, in a cubic system, each atom is at the corner, so the interatomic distance is a. If the crystal is rhombohedral with a=10 and theta=30, perhaps the actual interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) is a√something.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance would be a√(something), which could be different from a.

But the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So that suggests that a=10.

But maybe my confusion is between the lattice parameter and the interatomic distance. For example, if each atom is at the corner of a cube, the interatomic distance is a√1 for the edges, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so the interatomic distance is a. So a=10.

But that doesn't resolve the issue with the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a * sqrt( (1 + 2 cos(theta) ) / (1 - cos(theta)) )

But that's a made-up formula, and I don't know if it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) is a times sqrt(3) / (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to conclude that none of the approaches are working, and perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the interplanar distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. So d=10, option D. But that's just a guess.

Wait, but in a cubic system, the (111) plane has d= a / sqrt(3), which is about 5.77 when a=10. So the interplanar distance is less than a. So in this case, the answer can't be 10, unless the formula is different.

But in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees, so the formula could give a larger d than a.

Wait, considering that, perhaps the formula is:

d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But that gives negative.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the reciprocal. Maybe the formula is:

d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which for (111) would be 10 * sqrt(3 -6 *0.866)=10*sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Since all my approaches are leading me nowhere, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstroms.


To determine the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the following analysis was conducted:

1. **Understanding the Rhombohedral Crystal**:  
   A rhombohedral crystal is a special case of the triclinic crystal system where all lattice parameters \( a = b = c \) and all angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma \). The interatomic distance \( a \) refers to the distance between nearest neighbors along the lattice edges, which is given as \( 10 \, \text{Å} \).

2. **Interplanar Distance Formula**:  
   The interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for a crystal with lattice parameters \( a, b, c \) and angles \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) is generally given by:
   \[
   d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{k^2}{b^2} + \frac{l^2}{c^2} - 2\frac{hk}{ab}\cos\gamma - 2\frac{hl}{ac}\cos\beta - 2\frac{kl}{bc}\cos\alpha}}
   \]
   For a rhombohedral system (\( a = b = c \) and \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma \)), this simplifies to:
   \[
   d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl)\cos\alpha}}
   \]

3. **Substituting Values for (111) Plane**:  
   For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \) and \( \cos(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these into the formula:
   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)(0.866)}}
   \]
   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866}}
   \]
   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 + 5.196}}
   \]
   \[
   d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}}
   \]
   \[
   d_{111} \approx \frac{10}{2.864} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around \( 9 \, \text{Å} \). This suggests either an error in the formula or a misinterpretation of the interatomic distance.

5. **Revisiting the Formula**:  
   Alternative approaches were considered, including using the reciprocal lattice, unit cell volume, and other derivations. However, all attempts led to inconsistencies or values that did not align with the given options.

6. **Final Conclusion**:  
   Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the provided options, and the lack of clarity in resolving the discrepancy, the most plausible answer based on the options is **C) 9.54 Å**.

Answer: C
