Okay, let me think through this problem step by step. So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities. From what I remember, luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law! Which says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, how does mass relate to temperature here? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a red herring since the luminosity calculation here uses radius and temperature. Oh, but wait, the question says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation, right? Which is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So if both have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That makes sense.

Wait, but then if their temperatures are the same, how do their luminosities compare? Let's plug into the Stefan-Boltzmann formula. L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴. And L2 = 4π R2² σ T⁴. So the ratio L1/L2 would be (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait the options have 2.23, 2.25, etc. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Hmm. But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, wait, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Does that affect anything?

Oh wait, the radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But I thought that doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation, which is based on their intrinsic properties (radius and temperature). Unless perhaps it affects the observed flux or something else. But the question says they computed the luminosities assuming blackbody radiation. So maybe the radial velocities are a distraction, or perhaps it's about the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest (λ_max) are the same. So in their rest frame, if their temperatures are the same, their λ_max are the same. But if they are moving, their observed λ_max would be Doppler shifted.

Ah! Oh right! So the observed wavelength might be different from the actual emitted wavelength. So, let's think about that. Let's say Star_1 has a certain temperature and emits at λ_max, but because it's moving, we observe a different λ. Similarly for Star_2.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. So perhaps the Doppler shift is causing the same observed λ_max despite different actual temperatures.

Wait, but earlier I thought that λ_max for both stars is the same, implying same T. But if they have different velocities, maybe their actual temperatures are different, but the observed λ_max is same because of Doppler shift.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me re-examine the problem statement:

Astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. So, if the stars are moving towards or away from us, their observed λ_max would differ from their rest frame λ_max.

So, let's model this. Let's denote the rest frame λ_max as λ0, which for each star depends on their T. The observed λ is given by λ_obs = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (v along line of sight), and c is speed of light. But wait, I might have the formula wrong. Let me think: the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), assuming v is small compared to c. Or alternatively, the relativistic Doppler effect. But since the velocities given are 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% the speed of light (c ≈ 3e5 km/s), so 700 is about 0.0023c. So maybe the approximation is manageable.

Wait, but let's think. The observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

For Star_1, v_r1 is 0, so lambda_obs1 = lambda0_1.

For Star_2, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's say it's moving away, so the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). So lambda_obs2 = lambda0_2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) ) ).

Since lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2, we have:

lambda0_1 = lambda0_2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

But lambda0 is given by Wien's law: lambda0 = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Therefore,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Alternatively,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c) )

But wait, what's the sign of v_r? If Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive. So, if Star_2's observed wavelength is longer (moved away), then T2 would be lower, because lambda0 is longer. So with the same observed lambda, but higher lambda0, you have lower T.

Wait, but Star_1's v_r is 0, so lambda_obs1 is lambda0_1. Star_2 has v_r2 = 700 km/s, so lambda_obs2 = lambda0_2 * Doppler factor.

Since they're the same, we can relate lambda0_1 and lambda0_2 via the Doppler shift.

But since lambda0_1 = b / T1 and lambda0_2 = b / T2, substituting:

lambda0_1 = lambda0_2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Which gives:

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c) )

Hmm, so T2 is less than T1 because v_r2 is positive (assuming Star_2 is moving away, so Doppler shift makes its observed wavelength longer, implying that its emitted wavelength is shorter than observed. But wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, Star_2's observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength (lambda0_2) would be shorter than the observed wavelength, because moving away makes the wavelength longer (redshift). So in this case, lambda_obs2 = lambda_obs1 = lambda0_1 = lambda0_2 * Doppler factor. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted lambda0_2 is shorter than lambda_obs2, but since lambda_obs1 is same as lambda_obs2, lambda0_1 = lambda_obs1 = lambda0_2 * Doppler factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should approach it numerically.

Let me calculate the Doppler factor.

v_r2 =700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s.

v_r2/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333...

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333, 1 - v_r2/c ≈ 0.997667.

The ratio (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00467.

Taking the square root: sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.00233.

So lambda_obs2 = lambda0_2 * 1.00233.

But lambda_obs1 = lambda0_1.

Since lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2, so lambda0_1 = lambda0_2 * 1.00233.

But lambda0 is b / T, so:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.00233

Cancel b:

1/T1 = 1.00233 / T2

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

Wait, that can't be right because if Star_2's Doppler shift is making its observed wavelength longer, and if it were moving away, then its emitted wavelength would be shorter, implying higher temperature. But according to this, T2 = T1 * 1.00233, so T2 is larger than T1. But wait, that can't be the case because Star_2's observed wavelength is same as Star_1's. Oh wait, maybe I got the direction wrong.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So, if the observed wavelength is same as Star_1's, which is lambda0_1, then lambda0_2 must be shorter than lambda_obs1. So, lambda0_2 = lambda_obs1 / 1.00233.

Because lambda_obs2 = lambda0_2 * 1.00233 = lambda_obs1.

So, lambda0_2 = lambda_obs1 / 1.00233.

But lambda0_1 = b / T1 and lambda0_2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b/T2) * 1.00233

Again, same as before, leading to T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

Wait, but that would mean Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But that's conflicting with the idea that Star_1 has larger radius and perhaps larger luminosity.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the velocities. Alternatively, perhaps Star_2 is moving towards us, leading to blueshift. Let's try that.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then v_r2 is -700 km/s. So,

(1 + v/c) becomes (1 - 700/3e5) = 0.997667,

(1 - v/c) becomes 1 + 700/3e5 = 1.002333.

So the ratio (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99534.

The square root is sqrt(0.99534) ≈ 0.99767.

So Doppler factor is 0.99767.

So lambda_obs2 = lambda0_2 * 0.99767.

But lambda_obs1 is lambda0_1.

Since lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2,

lambda0_1 = lambda0_2 * 0.99767.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 0.99767.

So,

1 / T1 = 0.99767 / T2

Which implies,

T2 = T1 * 0.99767.

So T2 is lower than T1.

Ah, that makes more sense. So Star_2 is moving towards us, making its emitted wavelength shorter (since it's blueshifted), so for the observed wavelength to be the same as Star_1's (which isn't moving), Star_2 must have a higher temperature in its rest frame.

Wait, no. Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, so the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest frame. So if the observed lambda for Star_2 is same as Star_1, which isn't moving, then Star_2's rest frame lambda must be longer (so when blueshifted, it becomes same as Star_1's lambda). Because suppose Star_2 emits at a longer wavelength and moves towards us, so the observed wavelength would be same as Star_1's.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the temperatures.

So, for Star_2, the observed λ is λ0_2 * Doppler factor. The Doppler factor is less than 1 because it's moving towards us, causing the observed wavelength to be shorter.

So, λ_obs2 = λ0_2 * 0.99767.

But λ_obs1 = λ0_1.

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ0_1 = λ0_2 * 0.99767.

But λ0 is b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 0.99767 → 1/T1 = 0.99767 / T2 → T2 = T1 * 0.99767.

So, T2 is smaller than T1.

So, the temperatures are different.

Wait, that's a key point. So earlier assumption that T1 = T2 is incorrect because of the Doppler shift. So I have to factor this into the luminosity calculation.

So, luminosity L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

And, from earlier, T2 = T1 * 0.99767 ≈ T1 * 0.99767.

Wait, so T2 is approximately T1, but slightly less.

Wait, but 0.99767 is approximately 0.99767 ≈ 1 - 0.00233.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.00233) → approximately T1 * 0.99767.

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

Taking the ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1/R2 = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 1 / 0.99767 ≈ 1.00233.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = (1.00233)^4 ≈ ?

Calculating (1.00233)^4.

We can approximate using the binomial expansion.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² + ... for small x.

Here, x = 0.00233, n=4.

(1.00233)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.00233) + (4*3/2)*(0.00233)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.00233)^3 + ... 

Let me compute each term:

Term 1: 1.

Term 2: 4 * 0.00233 = 0.00932.

Term3: 6*(0.00233)^2 = 6*(0.0000054289) = ~0.00003257.

Term4: 4*(0.00233)^3 = 4*(0.0000000125) ≈ 0.00000005.

So, adding all terms:

1 + 0.00932 = 1.00932.

+ 0.00003257 → 1.00935257.

+ 0.00000005 → 1.00935262.

So approximately 1.00935.

But wait, let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps compute it using a calculator approach.

(1.00233)^2 = (1 + 0.00233)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 → 1 + 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 1.0046654289.

Then square that to get the fourth power:

(1.0046654289)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.0046654289) + (0.0046654289)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.0093308578 + 0.000021764 → ≈ 1.00935262.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935.

So, approximately 1.00935.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 * 1.00935.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00935 = approximately 0.0210375.

Adding together: 2.25 + 0.0210375 ≈ 2.2710375.

So approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest option would be option C) ~2.35, but wait, that's higher than our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the direction of the velocity. Let me reevaluate the Doppler effect.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest frame wavelength. So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, wait, I think I might have the Doppler formula backwards earlier. Let me check the formula again.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

If the source is moving towards the observer, β is positive, and λ_obs < λ_rest (blue shift).

So in this case, for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away or towards us?

The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So, what is the sign convention? Radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards.

So, Star_2 has radial velocity of +700 km/s, meaning moving away.

So, for Star_2 moving away, β = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So,

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) )

Calculate (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) = (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99534.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.99534) ≈ 0.99767.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.99767.

But lambda_obs1 is λ_rest1.

Since the observed wavelengths are the same,

λ_rest1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 0.99767.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 0.99767.

But λ_rest is given by Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 0.99767 → 1 / T1 = 0.99767 / T2 → T2 = T1 * 0.99767.

So, T2 is lower than T1.

So, now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We have R1=R2 *1.5 → (1.5)^2=2.25.

T1= T2 / 0.99767 → T1^4 / T2^4 = (1 / 0.99767)^4 ≈ (1.00233)^4.

As calculated earlier, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.00935.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00935 ≈ 2.271.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, B is ~2.32, C is ~2.35. So 2.27 is closest to option D (~2.23) or option A (~2.25). Hmm, but 2.27 is about 2.27, so perhaps none of the options are exactly that. But perhaps my approximation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.00233)^4 more accurately.

(1.00233)^2 = 1.0046654289.

(1.0046654289)^2 = ?

Compute 1.0046654289 * 1.0046654289.

Let me compute it step by step:

= (1 + 0.0046654289)^2.

= 1 + 2 * 0.0046654289 + (0.0046654289)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093308578 + 0.000021764.

Adding up: 1 + 0.0093308578 = 1.0093308578.

+ 0.000021764 → 1.0093526218.

So, (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1.0093526218.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0093526218.

Compute 2.25 * 1.0093526218:

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.0093526218 ≈ 0.021037.

Adding: 2.25 + 0.021037 = 2.271037.

So approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options, which are:

A) ~2.25.

B) ~2.32.

C) ~2.35.

D) ~2.23.

Hmm, none matches exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, could it be that I should have considered the Doppler shift in the other direction? Let me think again about the velocities.

Star_1 has v_r=0, Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. Since radial velocity is positive when moving away, Star_2 is moving away.

So, the observed wavelength for Star_2 is longer than its emitted wavelength.

If both have the same observed λ_max, then:

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c) [approximate formula for small velocities].

Wait, no, the approximate formula for wavelength shift when v<<c is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive for moving away.

But that's the approximation for small velocities.

So,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 (1 + v_r2/c).

Set equal:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v_r2/c).

But λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) (1 + v_r2/c).

Simplify:

1 / T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2.

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, no, let me re-arrange:

1 / T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2 → T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, so T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact Doppler formula.

The exact Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when moving away.

Wait, no, the exact formula is:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when the source is moving away.

Wait, no. Let me get this right.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), where β = v/c.

But this applies when the source is moving away. If it's moving towards, it's sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ).

So for Star_2 moving away (v_r positive):

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), where β = 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333.

For Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Set λ_obs1 = λ_obs2:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But λ_rest is b / T, so,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Wait, that would make T2 larger than T1.

Because sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) is greater than 1.

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) )

Compute (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) → (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00467.

The square root is sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, this is the opposite of what I thought earlier. So earlier I thought Star_2 has lower T, but now it's higher.

But that seems contradictory. Let me think about it.

If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. So for the observed wavelength to be same as Star_1, which has λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, then Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter. Because when moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest. So for Star_2's observed wavelength to match Star_1's, Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter, which implies higher temperature.

Yes, that makes sense. Because a shorter wavelength corresponds to higher temperature. So T2 is higher than T1.

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 1 / 1.00233 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 → (0.99767)^4.

Compute that:

(0.99767)^2 = (approx 0.99534).

Then square that: (0.99534)^2 ≈ 0.99069.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99069.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the effective temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)). Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the rest-frame wavelengths are related to the temperatures as:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

where \(\beta = \frac{v_r}{c}\) is the velocity of Star_2 as a fraction of the speed of light. For Star_2, \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\beta = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

The Doppler factor is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}} \approx 1.00233
\]

or equivalently:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Term
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the binomial approximation for small \(\beta\):

\[
(1 - 0.00233)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00233) = 1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.99068
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99068 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 5: Closest Option
The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately \(2.23\), which matches option **D**.
