Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through this step by step. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances, so I need to calculate this correctly.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula, I think, is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh right, because in particle physics, the natural linewidth is given by the uncertainty principle, so the width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. But wait, I should make sure I'm using the right units here.

So first, I'll need to convert all the energy units to consistent units. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. The production energy is 8 GeV, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. Oh, wait, the mean decay distance probably depends on the velocity of the meson and its lifetime. Because the distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime. So the formula would be something like L = v * τ.

But how to find v? The meson's velocity can be found from its energy and mass. Since it's a resonance, I think it's produced with some kinetic energy, but wait, maybe I should calculate the velocity using relativistic equations.

Wait, the meson
