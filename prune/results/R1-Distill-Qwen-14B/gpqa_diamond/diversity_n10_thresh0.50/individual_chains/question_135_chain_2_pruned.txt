Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that when a particle decays, the energy released has to be enough to create the decay products. So, the mass of the boson must be greater than the combined mass of the particles it's decaying into.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. Wait, GeV is a unit of energy, right? And the rest mass of particles is usually given in that unit. So I need to figure out which fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV each because if the boson is producing a pair, each fermion would have mass up to 3 GeV.

Wait, right, because the decay would be X → f f̄, so each f must be at least half the mass of X. So 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The top quark is the heaviest, but I think its mass is around 173 GeV, way above 3 GeV, so it's out. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, but wait wait, I might have that wrong. Wait, I remember the top is the heaviest, then bottom, charm, strange, up, down, and the leptons like electrons, muons, taus.
