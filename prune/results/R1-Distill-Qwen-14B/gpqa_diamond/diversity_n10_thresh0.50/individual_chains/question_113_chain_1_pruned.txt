Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to match these observations to the correct chemical formula among the options given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak, especially around 2500-3300, right? Or is it more about the type of O-H? Oh, right, alcohols have a broad peak too, but maybe less broad than carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000. Oh, sometimes O-H in alcohols is around 3300-3500, but maybe the broadness suggests something else.

Also, the FTIR shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. What functional groups have that? ketones, aldehydes, maybe esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated or an aromatic ring, or maybe an amide? But wait, amides are lower, around 1650 maybe. Or perhaps it's an conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an ester where the carbonyl is conjugated with something else.

So from FTIR, possible functional groups: maybe a ketone and something else? Or perhaps an ester. Also, the presence of a carbonyl suggests oxygen-containing groups. The O-H might be from an alcohol or maybe another carbonyl group like a carboxylic acid, but that would usually have a much broader O-H peak.

Looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in al
