Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The compound X has some given IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let me think about what the reaction conditions imply. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydroboration reaction. Wait, no, wait—red phosphorus is often involved in the substitution reactions. Oh, right! When you have a compound with a triple bond (like an alkyne) reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. Specifically, for terminal alkynes, it usually adds two equivalents of HI, leading to a vicinal dihalide. But wait, another thought—if the alkyne is internal, maybe it would add in a different way, but I might be mixing this up with other reactions.

Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is also used in the substitution of certain functional groups, perhaps in the formation of alkenes via elimination, but more likely, I think it's about the hydration of alkynes. Or wait, maybe it's about adding HI across a triple bond. Let me think: when an alkyne reacts with HI, especially in the presence of a catalyst or certain conditions, it can add HI to form a diiodide. But wait, another possibility is that it's a hydrohalogenation of an alkyne. For example, adding HX (like HI) to an alkyne would add two molecules, turning the triple bond into a single bond with two X groups. But I'm a bit rusty on this, so I should probably think about the data first.

The IR and NMR data will help me figure out what compound X is. Let me start by analyzing those.

IR data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad region suggests the presence of an -OH group (maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or an alkyne (C-H stretch). Wait, the broadness could also indicate an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an alkyne's C-H stretch, which is usually around 3300 cm-1, but the range here is 3400–2500, which also includes O-H stretching. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the exact peaks: 3400–2500 is a broad region. If the compound has an alkyne, the C-H stretch is usually a strong, sharp peak around 3300 cm-1. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is broad and around 2500-3300. So maybe the compound has both an alkyne and a carbonyl group? Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Other IR peaks:
- 1720 cm-1: This is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids usually have it around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit higher depending on substitution.
- 1610 cm-1: This is in
