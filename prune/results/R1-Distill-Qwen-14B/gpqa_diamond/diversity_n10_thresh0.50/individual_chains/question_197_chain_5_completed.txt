Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see... The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, right? Or is it something else? Oh wait, no, maybe that's the other one. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is usually for the reduction of alkenes, but I'm not so sure. Wait, no, another thought: maybe it's for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Let me think. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI can also be used to reduce esters or ketones. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to remember: The Clemmensen reduction is for ketones and aldehydes, using Zn(Hg) and HCl, and it gives alkanes. But the reaction with red phosphorus and HI... Oh, right! That's the reaction where esters are reduced. So, red phosphorus and HI would reduce esters to alkanes. Or wait, maybe it's for the reduction of nitriles? No, wait, I think another possibility is that it's used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes as well, but more specifically, maybe it's used for the reduction of alkenes? Wait, no, that's hydrogenation, which needs metal catalysts. Maybe red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles? Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should first figure out what compound X is.

Looking at the data: IR and NMR. Let's start with the IR. The peaks are at 3400-2500, which is a broad region and probably an O-H stretch. Then 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H around 3000-2500. Wait, the IR has a 3400–2500 cm-1 region, which could indicate an O-H. But then 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

The NMR data: Let's look at the 1H NMR.

There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 1H. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehyde protons are around 9-10, but more downfield. Wait, but a broad peak could be an acid. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the peak is usually around 9-10, but more like a triplet or something else. But wait, in this case, the 10.5 is a singlet, broad, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid O-H proton. So that suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group.

Then, there are aromatic protons. 8.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, also d, 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, perhaps a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm, multiplet (m), 1H. That's probably a methine (CH) group adjacent to something. 1.7 ppm, m, 2H — maybe a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl or something. 1.4 ppm, d, 3H — that's a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or a carbon adjacent to a branch. 0.9 ppm, t, 3H — that's a terminal methyl group, probably from an ethyl chain or similar.

Putting this together, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. The NMR shows a para-substituted benzene, so perhaps 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So if it's a benzoic acid, the carbonyl would be in the COOH group, which typically absorbs around 1700 cm-1. But wait, the peak is at 1720, which is higher than 1700. Hmm, that could mean it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Because conjugation can increase the carbonyl absorption frequency. So if the compound is a benzophenone or something similar, the carbonyl might be around 1720.

Wait, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, the O-H in the IR would show a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which fits a carboxylic acid. Also, benzoic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700. So maybe the 1720 is because of an ester. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester of benzoic acid. So, something like phenyl acetate or similar. Let me think about the substituents.

Looking at the NMR: the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which for an ester might not fit, because esters don't have O-H protons. Wait, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, that would fit. Let me think: the 10.5 is the O-H of the carboxylic acid, the aromatic protons are para-substituted, and then the other signals are for the substituent.

Looking at the substituent's NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to something. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, perhaps. So putting that together: the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH3. Wait, that would be like a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group, but with branching.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. If the aromatic ring is para-substituted, and the substituent is a side chain.

So, the substituent's NMR: 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), 2H at 1.7 ppm (m), 3H at 1.4 (d), and 3H at 0.9 (t). Wait, so the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which is a terminal methyl group. So perhaps a longer chain, like ethyl or something. Let me think.

So, the substituent might be a butyl group, perhaps. Let's see:

The 0.9 t is 3H, so that's the end of a chain, maybe a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. But wait, the 1.4 d is 3H, which would be a methyl attached to a CH. So, perhaps a structure like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me think: sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2- as a substituent? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something else?

Wait, perhaps it's a isobutyl group. Isobutyl is (CH2)2CH-. No, isobutyl is (CH2CH(CH3)2). Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let's think: butyl groups can be n-, iso-, sec-, tert-.

n-Butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3.

iso-Butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no, wait. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3). No, wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2. No, I'm getting confused. Wait, perhaps it's better to sketch it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the aromatic ring, with some branching.

Wait, let's try to figure out the substituent chain.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (t) with 3H is a methyl group attached to a CH2. So, maybe CH2CH2CH3. But then, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet with 2H, which would be adjacent to the CH2. And the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet with 1H, which could be a CH that's connected to another group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Wait, but that would be a longer chain. Let me think of it as -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent group that is a secondary carbon attached to a methyl and another group. Let's try to see: the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) is a CH attached to something. Then the 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 connected to that CH, and the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl attached to the CH. Then, the 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would be something like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group? No, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, let me imagine the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. For instance, a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

But wait, let's count the NMR signals:

The substituent's signals: 2.9 (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H), 0.9 (3H).

So, the substituent is likely a four-carbon chain with a branch, perhaps a butyl group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, the substituent seems to be a secondary carbon (the 2.9 ppm is 1H, so CH), attached to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), then a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d), and a CH2CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2. No, wait, maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, let me think about the substituent structure. The substituent is connected to the benzene ring, and the substituent has a CH group (the 2.9 ppm, 1H), which is connected to a CH2 (1.7, 2H), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4, d), which is connected to a terminal CH2CH3 (0.9, t).

Wait, that would make the substituent a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. No, that's a pentyl group, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a four-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a secondary carbon attached to a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-. Hmm, but that seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would be a longer chain.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think of the possible options and see which one matches the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, looking at these, options A, C, and D have substituents on the benzene ring. Let's see.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group (so a COOH) at position 4, and a sec-butyl group. Wait, but the substituents are in the para positions. Wait, if the benzoic acid is at position 4, then the substituent would be perhaps at position 1, but not sure. Wait, no, the substituents are in para positions, so if the benzoic acid is at position 4, the substituent would be at position 1, but that would not be para.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: for benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, and the substituent would be at position 4 (para). So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Let me see if the NMR fits this.

The aromatic protons: in benzoic acid, the ring is substituted with COOH and another group. Wait, but the substituent would be in para position, so the ring would have two substituents: COOH and another group. Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic signals are 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical of a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each having two protons. Wait, but wait, if it's a para-disubstituted benzene, like two substituents opposite each other.

Wait, but in this case, the compound would have a COOH and a substituent group. So, for example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the ring would have two substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (the substituent), which are para. So, the ring would have two substituents, each para to each other.

In such a case, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H, as observed in the NMR. So that fits.

Now, the substituent's signals would come from the substituent group. Let's think about option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached at position 4.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is (CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2- ?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the substituent structure: the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2- ?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

But perhaps I should construct the substituent structure:

The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, maybe it's a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but in any case, the substituent would have a chain that includes a CH, a CH2, and a CH2CH3.

In the NMR, the substituent's protons:

At 2.9 ppm, a CH (1H) which is adjacent to a CH2 or another group. Then, 1.7 ppm (2H, m) would be the CH2 next to the CH. Then, 1.4 ppm (3H, d) would be a methyl group attached to the CH. And 0.9 ppm (3H, t) would be a terminal methyl group (CH2CH3).

Wait, that suggests the substituent has a structure like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But what would that be? That would be a pentyl group, but perhaps with a branch.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a butyl group where the second carbon has a methyl branch. That would be a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a pentyl group, right? No, that's a four-carbon chain, but with a branch.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model the substituent based on the NMR data.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is probably a CH group attached to another CH2. So, the structure would be something like CH-CH2-... .

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This is a CH2 next to the CH. So, the substituent would be CH-CH2-....

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to the CH. So, the structure is CH(CH3)-CH2-... .

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, which is part of a CH2CH2CH3. So, the substituent is CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that makes the substituent a pentyl group. But wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, but the substituent is attached to the benzene ring, so perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. That would be a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So, that would be a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the branching is on the second carbon. So, its structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, I think the structure of sec-butyl is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky, maybe I should think about the structure of each option.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4 (para). The substituent (sec-butyl) would have the structure CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, so the substituent's NMR would consist of:

The CH(CH3) group would give a triplet or something else, but in the given data, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm. The CH2 next to it would be at 1.7, and the CH3 would be at 1.4 (d), and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 (t).

Wait, but the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. The CH2 attached to the ring would have two protons. Then the CH(CH3) would have one proton, and the CH2 group would have two. But in the NMR, the substituent's signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m) → probably the CH.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, m) → the CH2 next to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (3H, d) → the methyl attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (3H, t) → the terminal methyl.

Wait, but in the substituent, the terminal CH2CH3 would be connected through a CH2 group. So, the substituent would be: ring-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that's a five-carbon chain, which seems too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that's four carbons, making it a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary carbon attached to a methyl and a CH2 group, then another CH2, then a CH3.

But regardless, perhaps the key point is that the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, leading to the NMR signals as given.

Now, for the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that do?

Red phosphorus and HI are usually used for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Wait, I think that's the case. So, if the carbonyl is a ketone or an aldehyde, it would be reduced to an alkane. However, in the case of esters, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think: red phosphorus and HI is used for the reduction of alkenes to alkanes, but I thought that's in the presence of HCl. Alternatively, maybe it's for the reduction of nitriles or amides.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, esters can be hydrolyzed. No, hydrolysis is usually under acidic or basic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction. If the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative (option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), then reaction with red phosphorus and HI—what happens?

Wait, but for a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is part of the COOH group. If we reduce that, with something like red phosphorus and HI, would that convert the COOH group to a CH2OH group? Or perhaps to a CH2NH2? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester. So, if the starting material is an ester, then red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to a primary alcohol.

Wait, but the initial compound X has a COOH group (from the IR and NMR data). So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then when reacted with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it would reduce the COOH group.

Wait, but in that case, what would happen? The COOH group (carbonyl) being reduced. The COOH group is a carbonyl (C=O) attached to an -OH. Reduction of a carboxylic acid would typically produce a primary alcohol. But wait, can red phosphorus and HI reduce a carboxylic acid? Or is there another possibility.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting material is an ester. If X is an ester, then red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to a primary alcohol. Let me see: for example, if X is benzyl acetate, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ester to benzyl alcohol.

But in this case, the NMR shows a COOH group. So perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid but an aldehyde. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be more for a carboxylic acid rather than an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but not as broad. Also, the IR at 1720 could be an ester, ketone, or aldehyde.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group. The reduction would convert the COOH group into a CH2OH group. Wait, but that would produce a benzyl alcohol derivative. However, I'm not sure about the exact product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. But the NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting material is a ketone. Let me think, if X is a ketone with a benzene ring, then the IR would show a peak around 1720, which matches. The NMR would have a singlet at 10.5 ppm, but that's more for an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Let me consider option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. But then, the substituent on the benzene is ethyl, so the aromatic NMR would be different.

Wait, the aromatic NMR in the question is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which suggests a para substituent. So, if the substituent is an ethyl group, then the ring would have two substituents, but that's not the case in option A, which is a propanoic acid attached to a 4-ethylphenyl group. So, the substituents would be at positions 1 (propanoic acid) and 4 (ethyl), which are para. So, that would fit the aromatic NMR.

But then, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as 8.0 and 7.2, which matches. Then, the substituent's NMR would be from the propionoic acid. The propanoic acid part would have a CH2 group next to the COOH. So, the propanoic acid would have a structure like CH2CH2COOH.

Wait, but the NMR data shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a CH attached to something. Then, 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest a longer chain.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, like methyl benzoate or something, the reaction would reduce the ester to a benzyl alcohol.

But going back to the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have a COOH group, and the substituent would have the NMR signals as described.

Assuming that the reaction reduces the COOH group. Wait, but how? Reduction of COOH to CH2OH would require certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me consider that for a moment. Suppose X is an ester, say, benzene ring with a substituent and an ester group. Then, red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ester to a primary alcohol.

But the NMR data suggests a COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but something else. Maybe it's a hydrolysis. But under what conditions? Red phosphorus and HI are usually strong reducing agents, not hydrolyzing agents.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but the NMR doesn't show any nitrile signals.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the options again.

Looking at the options, options A, C, and D have substituents on the benzene. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Let's think about the NMR for option C.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be:

O
||
O-C6H4-(sec-butyl)

So, the benzene ring has a COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the NMR.

The substituent's NMR: the sec-butyl group would have a CH(CH3) group attached to the ring via a CH2. Wait, no, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have the structure:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that's only two carbons beyond the ring. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH(CH3) group: would have a proton that's split into a doublet of doublets or something else. But in the NMR, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H). That fits.

- The CH2 groups: the CH2 attached to the ring would have protons that are split based on neighboring groups. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be the CH2 next to the CH(CH3).

- The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which fits.

- The terminal CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which also fits.

So, the substituent's NMR matches option C.

Now, the reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the reaction would involve the reduction of the COOH group.

Wait, but what's the product of reducing a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it would convert the COOH into a CH2OH group. Alternatively, maybe it would reduce the carbonyl to a CH2 group, but that's more for ketones.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation and substitution. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group in the benzoic acid to a methylene group. So, the COOH would become CH2OH, but without the O.

Wait, maybe the reduction would convert the COOH group into a CH3 group. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's converted into a CH2NH2 group, but that's more under different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction differently. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of esters to alkanes. For example, an ester RCOOR' is reduced to RCH2OR', which then undergoes some reaction. Alternatively, the ester is reduced to a primary alcohol.

Wait, but if X is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction is not applicable, so maybe X is an ester.

Wait, but the NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction is not with the COOH group, but with another functional group.

Wait, looking at the IR data, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These might indicate aromatic C=C stretching. So, compound X has an aromatic ring, which I've already considered.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a ketone group. But then, where would the ketone be?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a carbonyl group. For example, if the substituent is an isopropyl group with a ketone, but that's not matching the NMR.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. So, if X has a carbonyl group, perhaps an ester, a ketone, or an aldehyde, it would be reduced.

Assuming that X is an ester, like RCOOR', then the reaction would reduce the ester to RCH2OR', which upon workup would form RCH2OH. But in this case, the product would be a primary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile. But the NMR doesn't show any nitrile peaks.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So, if X is benzoic acid, the peak would be around 1700 cm-1. But 1720 suggests a more electron-deficient carbonyl, such as an ester or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester, and the NMR signals I thought were from a COOH group are actually from something else.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very high and broad, typical for a carboxylic acid O-H. So, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid.

But then the IR at 1720 would be a bit high. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR peak at 1720 is due to an ester carbonyl, and the 10.5 ppm is from an aldehyde. But that seems unlikely because aldehydes usually have a peak around 9-10 ppm, not as high as 10.5.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a higher wavenumber.

Wait, but without more data, it's hard to say.

Let me try to proceed with the initial assumption that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). So, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Red phosphorus and HI are a strong reducing agent. They can reduce carbonyl groups to CH2 groups. So, the COOH group (which is a carbonyl) would be reduced. So, the product would have a CH2 group where the COOH was.

Wait, but COOH is a carboxylic acid. Reduction of the carbonyl would convert the COOH group into a CH2OH group. Wait, but that would require a more specific condition, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction would convert the COOH group into a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reduction of the carbonyl group in the benzoic acid would produce benzyl alcohol. So, the COOH becomes a CH2OH group.

But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the aromatic ring, but that's not typical with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the options and their reactions.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reaction with red phosphorus and HI. If the product is an alkane, then perhaps the COOH group is reduced to a CH3 group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. No, that doesn't make sense because the substituents would be meta, not para.

Wait, perhaps the product is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but only the COOH group.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and the COOH is reduced to CH2OH, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is completely reduced to a CH3 group, making it 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that's not one of the options either.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene with substituents at positions 1 and 4. But that would imply two substituents, which isn't the case for option C.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't in the options. But that can't be; the options are given. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the structure of X.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Let's reconsider.

If X is an ester, like methyl benzoate, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to benzyl alcohol. But the NMR data would have to fit that, which it doesn't because of the 10.5 ppm peak.

Wait, unless the ester is attached to the benzene ring in such a way that the COO group is part of a substituent. For example, the substituent is an ester group like OCOCH2CH2CH3.

But then the NMR would have a peak around 4 ppm for the ester oxygen, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alkane.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If X is a ketone, then the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group.

So, the product would be a substituted benzene with a CH2 group instead of the ketone.

But then, the NMR data would have to fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile. But the NMR doesn't show any nitrile protons.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- Based on the NMR and IR data, X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

- The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carbonyl group. But I'm not certain about the exact product.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Decarboxylation of a benzoic acid would produce benzene. But that would require heating, and I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would induce that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that doesn't fit with the reagents.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid's COOH group to a CH2 group, making it benzene with a substituent.

But I'm not sure about the exact product.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But how?

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then perhaps upon reduction of the COOH group, it becomes a CH2 group, but more likely, it becomes a CH2OH, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings. But that typically uses ammonia and a metal like Na or Mg. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester group to a primary alcohol, but I don't see an ester in X.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the starting material is not a carboxylic acid but an ester. For example, if X is a methyl ester, then the reaction would produce a primary alcohol.

But the NMR data shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be a carboxylic acid, not an ester.

Wait, perhaps the IR peak at 1720 is an ester carbonyl, and the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. But that doesn't make sense because an aldehyde would be around 9-10 ppm, not 10.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde, and the 1720 is a ketone or ester.

But I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester group to an alcohol. So, if X is an ester, say, RCOOR', then the product would be RCH2OH.

But the NMR doesn't show an ester's oxygen or the R group.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of nitriles to amines, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile group to an amine, but there's no nitrile in the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that X is a ketone. For example, if X is acetophenone, then the reaction would reduce the ketone to an ethyl group. So, the product would be toluene.

But in this case, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group, so perhaps the product would have a longer chain.

But the NMR data suggests a substituent with a CH and a CH2 group, which would fit a reduction of a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a butyl group attached to the ring via a ketone. For example, (sec-butyl)phenyl ketone.

But then, the NMR would show a ketone's proton, which is usually around 2.1 ppm as a singlet. But in the data, there's nothing around 2.1 ppm.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to make a decision based on the data.

The initial analysis suggests that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong reducing agent, it would reduce the carbonyl group. The product would likely be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is reduced to a CH2 group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But none of the options directly match that.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But I don't see how that would form from the reduction of X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but a substitution. Wait, but I don't see any leaving groups in X.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent but reduces the COOH group to a CH2 group, making it 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which isn't an option, so maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester, but the data doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me think: the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde's proton. But why is the IR at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl.

So, perhaps X is an aldehyde with an aromatic ring. Then, the reaction would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group.

But the substituent's NMR would need to match.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propiolic acid (but that's probably not the case).

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's try to think about the answer options again.

The options after reaction are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: still has a COOH group.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: a toluene derivative.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: same as X.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: another toluene derivative.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but reduces something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzoic acid ester, like methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then, reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ester to a benzyl alcohol. But the NMR data would have to fit that.

The NMR of the ester would have a methyl group attached to oxygen (around 3.8 ppm), which isn't present in the data. So that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that option C is the correct starting material, and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH2OH group, but the product isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but does something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: what's the actual reaction of red phosphorus and HI with a benzoic acid?

Upon checking (in my mind), I recall that red phosphorus and HI can reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. So, the COOH group (RCOOH) would be reduced to RCH3.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group (from COOH reduction). But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. However, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. Wait, but that would imply two substituents on the ring, which is not the case for option C.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct answer is option C because the starting material is that, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent but reduces the COOH group. But I'm not seeing the exact product in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but an elimination. But I don't see how that would fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should go with option C as the starting material and the product being a reduction of the COOH to a CH3 group, making 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think again about the NMR data.

The substituent's NMR: 2.9 (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), 0.9 (3H, t).

The substituent is a chain with a CH, then a CH2, then a CH3, and a terminal CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is likely a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring.

That would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch, but perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon. So, the structure would be CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- attached to the ring.

In that case, the substituent is a iso-butyl group? Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that has three methyl groups attached to a central carbon.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, making it a pentyl group with a branch.

But then, the substituent's NMR would have the CH at 2.9 ppm, CH2 at 1.7, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a neopentyl group, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with the structure CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

So, the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon. That would be a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Thus, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH is reduced to CH2OH or CH3.

If reduced to CH3, the product is 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But looking at the options, none of them match. However, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have substituents at 1 and 4. But X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have only one substituent (the COOH group and the sec-butyl at para positions). So, after reduction, the product would have two substituents: the methyl from the COOH reduction and the sec-butyl, making them at para positions. But option D has substituents at 1 and 4, which are ortho and para to each other, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the product structure. Maybe the product is simply the removal of the COOH group and adding a CH3, making the substituent at position 4 a sec-butyl group and position 1 a methyl group. But that would require the COOH to be at position 1, which it isn't.

Wait, perhaps the reduction doesn't add a methyl but converts the COOH into a CH2 group.

But without knowing the exact reaction outcome, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should make an educated guess. The starting material is option C, and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH3, giving a product that's not listed. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, the options are for the product, not the starting material. So the question is: which product is formed when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Assuming X is option C, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not an option. So perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce the COOH group but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone group elsewhere, but I don't see that in the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a CH2CH3 group. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 group, and the multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group.

This suggests a substituent like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a pentyl group with a branch. But that's five carbons, which isn't matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a iso-butyl group. Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-.

Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, making the structure 4-(iso-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, the substituent's NMR would have the CH(CH3)2 group. The NMR would show a singlet for the CH(CH3)2, but in the data, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the CH(CH3)3, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option C as the starting material and the product being something else, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but something else. Maybe X is an ester, and the reaction reduces it to a primary alcohol. But the NMR doesn't fit that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a ketone, and the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. But that doesn't make sense, as aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a nitrile, but I don't see any nitrile protons in the NMR.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the data, the starting material is likely option C, and the reaction reduces the COOH group to a CH3, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct product is not listed. But since I have to choose from the given options, I'll have to pick the best fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ester group to an alcohol, but I can't find an ester in the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the starting material. Maybe the starting material is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But then, the NMR wouldn't fit because the aromatic protons would be different.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, possibly from a carboxylic acid or an ester.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely a CH group adjacent to other groups.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A terminal methyl group, likely from a CH₂CH₃.

### Structural Determination:
The data suggests that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C)**. This structure fits the para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent. The NMR signals match the expected protons for this structure.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are strong reducing agents. In this case, they reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The product is **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**, which is not explicitly listed among the options. However, the closest match to the reaction outcome is **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, which has a methyl group and a sec-butyl group on a benzene ring, even though the substituents are not in the correct positions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C)**, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI produces a product similar to **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, despite the substituent positions not being perfectly aligned.
