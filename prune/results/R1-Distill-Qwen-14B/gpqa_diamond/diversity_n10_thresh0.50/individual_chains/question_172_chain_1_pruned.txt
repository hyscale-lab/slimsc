Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, if they're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level, which is the population of a certain energy state, is higher in star_1. I think the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, star_1 has twice the excitation level as star_2. So n1/n2 = 2? Or is it the other way around? Wait no, star_1 has higher excitation, so if n is the number in the excited state, then n1 = 2 * n2. Or maybe I should think in terms of their ratios relative to each other. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the ratio n1/(n1_total) is twice that of n2/(n2_total)? Or maybe it's just the ratio of the excited
