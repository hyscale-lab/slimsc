Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is smaller with radius r, so r < R. There's a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. The point P is also at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity is s. The angle between l and s is theta. And there's a charge +q placed inside the cavity. The question is asking for the electric field E at point P.

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged initially. When we place a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in electrostatics, the charges redistribute themselves in conductors. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. But when we put a charge inside the cavity, that should induce charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Oh right! The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q in the cavity repels the electrons in the conductor, pushing them to the inner surface. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must then have a +q charge to balance it out. Because the total conductor is neutral, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q.

But wait, no. Wait, conductor is neutral. So if there's a +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced -q, and the outer surface must have a +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral: the inner induces -q, so the outer must have +q to sum to zero.

So, the outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor?

Oh, I remember that the electric field outside a conducting shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, for a point outside the conductor (like point P), the field depends only on the charge on the outer surface. The inner charge (-q) doesn't contribute to the external field because the conductor shields it.

So the field at point P should be due to the +q charge on the outer surface of
