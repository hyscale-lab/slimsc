Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and there are three reagents used in sequence. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, let's parse the molecular formula. C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for this molecule: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a couple of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees) and a double bond and a ring? Or another setup.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet. High ppm, so probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group here.

6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) – these look like aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests they are para to something de-shielding, like an electron-withdrawing group. Maybe these are two sets of para-substituted aromatic protons.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton or something else. But it's 2H, so maybe two equivalent protons like a CH2 group adjacent to something. Or maybe it's part of an aromatic ring but in a different environment.

3.66 (d, 2H) – a doublet, 2H. This could be a CH2 group attached to something deshielded. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. For example, a CH2O group, as in an ether or ester, or maybe a carbonyl adjacent.

So putting this together, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and another substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. Benzene is C6H6. Then the remaining substituents would be C2H3NO. Hmm. Let me think: maybe the substituent is a nitro group? Or an amino? Or perhaps an aldehyde and another group.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's an aldehyde proton (9.72), so maybe the substituent is an aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring. But wait, that would leave C2H3NO. Hmm, alternative approach: maybe the molecule is a diaryl compound with a side chain that includes the aldehyde and another group.

Looking at the options, they're all butenals or similar. Let's see the options:

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So structure would be Ph-
