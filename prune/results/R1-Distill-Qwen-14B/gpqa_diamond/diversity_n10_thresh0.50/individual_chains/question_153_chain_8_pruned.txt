Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each part gives reactants and conditions, and I need to figure out the major products. Then, match these products to the options given.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. 

I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate. So dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has an alpha-beta unsaturated ester structure, so it's the electrophilic part.

Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups and a CH2 in the middle. In the presence of a base like NaOEt, the malonate would deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position (the less substituted carbon) of the acrylate.

Wait, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. So when the enolate attacks, the nucleophile (from the malonate) will add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. This would form a new carbon-carbon bond.

After the attack, the product would have the malonate's groups attached. So the acrylate's structure is CH2=CH-C(OR)R', where R is ethyl and R' is p-tolyl. The attack would happen at the CH2, leading to a new substituent.

Wait, perhaps the addition is at the beta position, which is the CH2 part. So the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2-CH2-CO-OEt? No, wait, no. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt, right? So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the substituents on C2 being the p-tolyl and the ester group.

So when the enolate attacks, it adds to the C1 (the beta position relative to the carbonyl), which is connected to the double bond. Wait, no, the attack is on the beta carbon relative to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is on C3. Then the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the beta position is C2. So the enolate would attack C2.

So the product would have the malonate's group added to the C2 position. Let me draw this out mentally. The initial acrylate is CH2=CH-C(OEt)(p-tolyl). The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the C2 (
