Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. So, we've got an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle has 2 times that, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Wait, but the problem says 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm. So the setup is kind of like a central charge with twelve others arranged around it, each at a distance of 2 meters. So, all the 12 are at the same distance from P.

I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Oh right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions.

Wait, but wait. Each charge is 2e. So, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so it's not moving. The other 12 are each at 2m from P. So, the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? Let me think. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since the system is made of multiple charges, I need to calculate the total potential energy. But wait, in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each unique pair. So for each pair (i,j), i < j, I calculate U_ij and sum them all.

In this case, there are 13 charges. But one is fixed at P, and the others are 12 around it. So, the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 other charges will interact with it, and also with each other.

Wait, no. Wait, the 13th charge is at P, fixed. So, each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So, each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from
