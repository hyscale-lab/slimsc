Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space. But wait, I'm not entirely sure what 'uniformly distributed' exactly implies here. Maybe it means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant?

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Oh right, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the question is asking about the number of stars per unit of plx. So like, for each small change in parallax, how many stars do we expect? Since parallax is inversely related to distance, maybe we should think about how the number of stars depends on distance, and then relate that back to parallax.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr should be the volume of the shell times the number density. So N = 4π r² dr * n, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But we want this in terms of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so distance d = 1/plx. So r is 1/plx. Let me write r = d, so plx = 1/d. Then dr is the change
