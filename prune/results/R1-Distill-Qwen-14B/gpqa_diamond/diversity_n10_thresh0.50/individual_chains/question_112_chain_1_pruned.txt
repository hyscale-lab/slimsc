Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first off, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is usually represented as a vector in a Hilbert space, and here it's a two-dimensional space since we're dealing with spin up and spin down states.

The question is asking two main things: first, the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and second, the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the elements Aij are hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, the options given are A to D, each providing two probabilities and an average value.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional, which means it's not necessarily normalized. Then, I need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of the operator A. Wait, wait, waitâ€”the operator A's matrix is given. Let me think about that.

The operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if iâ‰ j, and zero otherwise. So in a two-dimensional space, the matrix would look like:
[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0      ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. That looks familiarâ€”this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices are:
X = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, if A is (hbar/2) times X, then its eigenstates are the eigenstates of X, which are the eigenstates of spin in the x-direction, right? Those eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the problem states that the operator's eigenstates are the ones we need to measure. So, the states |+x> and |-x> are the eigenstates of
