Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question is asking about the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one using matrix exponential functions approximated by a fractional approximation. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that solving partial differential equations, especially heat equations, often involves discretizing the equations using finite differences. For higher dimensions, the problem becomes more complex, and using parallel methods can help speed things up.

Matrix exponential functions come into play when dealing with systems that can be represented in matrix form. The solution to such systems, especially over time, often involves matrix exponentials. But matrix exponentials can be computationally expensive, especially for large matrices. So, approximating them using fractional approximations might make them more manageable.

Now, the question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. Sequential algorithms are single-threaded, whereas parallel algorithms split the workload across multiple processors or threads. So, the key must be something that allows the algorithm to be split into parts that can run concurrently.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I'm not sure how it directly relates to making the algorithm parallel. Maybe it's about ensuring each part is stable when run in parallel, but I'm not certain if that's the key factor here.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate the setup, but I don't immediately see how that affects parallelism. It's more about the nature of the problem setup than the algorithm's structure.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximations... Wait, fractional here might refer to something like the Pad√© approximant, which is a way to approximate functions with rational functions. If the approximation has complex roots, that could mean the matrix has complex eigenvalues. But how does that affect parallel algorithms? Maybe if the approximation leads to a system that can be decomposed into independent parts, each part could be solved in parallel. Alternatively, complex roots might not be the main factor here.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are a way to decompose complex expressions into simpler terms. Linear partial fractions would break down the approximation into parts that might be easier to handle individually. If each part can be processed independently, that would lend itself well to parallel computation because each term could be computed on a different processor or thread. So this might be the key factor enabling parallelism.

Wait, so when you use a fractional approximation, especially one that can be linearly decomposed into partial fractions, each fraction can be handled separately. This decomposition allows each term to be computed in parallel, thus converting the sequential process into a parallel one. That makes sense.

Stability analysis (A) is crucial for the method's correctness, but the question is about the conversion factor. So probably not A. Nonlocal boundary conditions (B) are part of the problem setup, not the algorithm's parallelism. Complex roots (C) might complicate things but I don't see them as the key factor for parallel conversion. Linear partial fraction (D) seems more about breaking the problem into manageable, parallel tasks.

So the answer should be D
