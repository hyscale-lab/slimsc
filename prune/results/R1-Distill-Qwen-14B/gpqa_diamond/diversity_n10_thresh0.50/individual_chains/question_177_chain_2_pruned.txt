Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there's two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. So, that must be related to their temperatures, right? Because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law, lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same.

Wait, but wait! Because the problem says the stars are radiating as black bodies. So yes, their temperatures are the same because the peak wavelengths are the same.

But wait, the problem also gives their radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So, would that impact the calculated temperature? Because when a star is moving towards us or away from us, its spectral lines shift, which can make it look hotter or cooler than it actually is. But in this case, since Star_1's radial velocity is zero, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. But Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, so how does that affect its observed temperature?

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So they see the same lambda_max for both. But if Star_2 is moving, its observed lambda_max is different from its actual emitted lambda_max. So, we have to consider that when calculating the actual temperature, the Doppler shift comes into play.

Let me think. The observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light, which it is here (700 km/s is about 0.0023% the speed of light, which is small). Alternatively, using the approximation for small velocities: lambda_observed â‰ˆ lambda
