Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix equal volumes of two solutions, the concentration halves. Oh wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, but when you dilute it, the concentration goes down, right? So the initial solution is 0.05 M, and after adding 20 cm³ of water (same volume as the acetic acid), the new volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L) = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M? Wait, wait, no. Wait, M = moles/volume. So initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) water, the total volume is 0.02 + 0.02 = 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, right.

So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Then we start titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. Wait, when they say 25% titration, does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH? Or 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence has been added? Hmm. I think it's the latter. Because in titration, the percentage usually refers to the volume added relative to the equivalence point volume.

So I need to find the equivalence point volume first. Let's calculate that. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles (as calculated before). Since the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence point will also be 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³.

At 25% titration, we have added 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 liters. Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this amount of NaOH will react with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. The total moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001, so after reaction, moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.0002
