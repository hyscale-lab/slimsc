Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance s. Oh, right, and a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Wait, I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, any charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh right, the cavity is nonconducting, right? Because it's a cavity. So the charge +q inside would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q. Then, because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

But wait, how does this affect the electric field outside? The electric field outside a conductor depends on the total charge on the outer surface. Since the outer surface has charge +q, the electric field at a point outside should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but wait a second. The conductor's outer surface is spherical, right? So any external point, regardless of the internal configuration, should have an electric field based on the net charge outside. So in this case, the outer charge is +q. So the electric field E at point P should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q/(L²)), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor.

Let me look at the options. Option B is exactly that: 1/(4πε₀) * q/(L²). But wait, other options involve l and theta. Why would that be?

Wait, point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, but l is the distance from the cavity's center. Hmm, but the outer surface charge is +q, so when we're outside the conductor, the field should only depend on the total charge outside, which is +
