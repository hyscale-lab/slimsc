Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm. Let me think this through step by step.

Alright, first, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the inverse of the parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So, d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in what sense? I think it probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I'm looking for N(>plx) or something like that. Wait, no, it's the number per unit plx range. So, maybe it's the differential number of stars in a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. So, N(plx) dplx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. But how does parallax relate to distance? Because plx is inversely proportional to distance, so I need to express dV in terms of plx.

Let me think about the volume. For a given distance d, the volume of a spherical shell (like a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr) is 4π d² dr. But wait, the parallax plx is 1/d. So, d = 1/plx. So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, because d = 1/plx implies that dr/dplx = -1/plx². So, dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. But I think I can ignore the negative sign because I'm dealing with a small range, so dplx is positive.

Now, the volume element dV for a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = (-1/plx²) dplx (but taking the absolute value since dV is positive), that becomes 4π (1
