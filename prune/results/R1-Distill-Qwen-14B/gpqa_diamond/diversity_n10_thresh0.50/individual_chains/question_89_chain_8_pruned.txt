Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to walk through each part carefully.

Alright, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So, 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it usually does an elimination reaction to form an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But wait, in this case, the dihalide isn't vicinal. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but in a different way. Wait, wait another thought—KOH in such conditions might lead to a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps, since it's a dihalide, maybe it's undergoing a double elimination to form an alkyne? Oh, wait no, alkyne formation usually needs a stronger base and higher temperatures, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination to form a conjugated diene, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of something like an epoxide, but no, epoxides are usually formed from alkenes with peracids. Or maybe a ketone? The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests a ketone is formed. So how does heating dibromoadamantane with KOH produce a ketone?

Oh! Wait, maybe it's a case of elimination to form a carbonyl. So, for example, when a dihalide with two adjacent X groups undergoes dehydrohalogenation, it can form a carbonyl. Like, if two adjacent carbons each have a Br, eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl group. But wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are on carbons 1 and 3. Are they adjacent? Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are across from each other, maybe? So not adjacent. So elimination would not form a carbonyl from them.

Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a single elimination from each Br, leading to a diene? But then the IR wouldn't show a strong carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product's 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet perhaps. That could be from an oxygen-bearing group, like an epoxide, but no, because an epoxide's protons are typically around 3-4 ppm, but split into a triplet or so. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with adjacent protons? Or maybe it's an alcohol. Wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so it's a ketone. So maybe each Br is replaced
