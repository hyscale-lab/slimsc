Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity formulas.

Let me read the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, the relative speed. Wait, wait. So if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c. Oh right, because in relativity, velocities don't add up that way. I think the formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me get that right.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Wait, the problem says they're moving in the positive x-direction. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B? Or wait, no—wait, are we calculating the relative speed as seen by one astronaut? Like, the relative speed between them would be when considering the frame of one, how fast the other is moving. Oh, right. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, but both in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me write that down. Let me denote the velocities as v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. So the relative velocity, u, would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait—because from A's frame, B's velocity is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)) if I'm subtracting the velocities correctly. Wait, let me think. No, wait, when you're calculating the relative velocity, it's u = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Because in the frame S where A is moving at v1, B is moving
