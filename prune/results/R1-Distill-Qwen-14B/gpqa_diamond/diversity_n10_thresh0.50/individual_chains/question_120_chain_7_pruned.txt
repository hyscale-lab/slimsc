Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are various inverse power laws of parallax. 

Okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star. I think the formula is distance d = 1/(plx), where plx is in parsecs, right?

So the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about this. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means their number density is constant. Wait, number density is stars per unit volume. 

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I guess I need to find how many stars fall into a small range of parallax, like d plx. 

Hmm, let's model this. Suppose the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV, where n is the number density (since it's uniform, n is constant). 

But I need to express dV in terms of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me think about a shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π d² dd. So dV = 4π d² dd.

But wait, we're looking for the number per unit parallax. So, if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd
