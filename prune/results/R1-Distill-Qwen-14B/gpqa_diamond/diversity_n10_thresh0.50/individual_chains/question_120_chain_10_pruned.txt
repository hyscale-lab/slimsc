Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A to D, each with different exponents. 

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Oh right, parallax (often denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer to us. And since stars are spread out in space, their distribution affects how many we can see at different distances.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I imagine looking at a range of parallaxes, how does the count of stars in each slice change as parallax increases or decreases.

I remember that for a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Because the universe (or galaxy) isn't expanding in this scenario, more stars would be found in larger volumes. But how does this translate to parallax?

Wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume dV would be proportional to dV. But the volume itself depends on distance. Let me think: for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr. So if the number of stars is proportional to volume, then the number per unit volume is n, and the number in the shell is n * 4πd² dr.

But wait, the question is about parallax. Parallax plx is equal to 1/d (in parsecs), so d = 1/plx. So if I express everything in terms of plx, that's plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx, and dr would be the change in distance. Let me express dr in terms of plx. Taking derivative, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need to worry about the negative sign here. Since I'm considering a small change in plx, maybe the absolute value is more important.

So, dV is the volume of a thin spherical shell, which is 4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. Now, expressing dr in terms of plx: dr is the change in distance when plx changes by dplx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative indicates that as plx increases (since plx = 1/d), the distance decreases, but since we're looking for number per unit plx, I'm more interested in the magnitude.

Putting it all together, the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax plx would be proportional to 4π (1/plx)^2 * |dr|. Which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, let me see: dr is (1/plx²) dplx times the negative. But the absolute value is (1/plx²) dplx. So plugging that in, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. 

Simplifying, that's n *
