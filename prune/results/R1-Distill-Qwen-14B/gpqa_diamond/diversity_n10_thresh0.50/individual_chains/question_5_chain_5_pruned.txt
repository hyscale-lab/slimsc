Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like the muon, the components of the operator (like P_x, P_y, P_z) are 2x2 matrices. The eigenvalues for the total spin operator along any direction would be ±ħ/2.

But wait, the problem is about the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it lies somewhere in the plane formed by x and z axes. That would imply that the angle theta (I think polar angle) is between 0 and 90 degrees, or 0 and pi/2 radians. So, the direction can be described by an angle phi (azimuthal angle) around the z-axis.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin operator along an arbitrary direction can be written as a combination of the standard components. Oh right, the operator P along direction n is given by P · n, where n is a unit vector. So, P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the problem says that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So that means n_y =
