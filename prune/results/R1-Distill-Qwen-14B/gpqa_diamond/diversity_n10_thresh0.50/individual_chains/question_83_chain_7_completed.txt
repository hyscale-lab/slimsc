Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The problem gives me some specific volumes and concentrations, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's parse the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Diluting with water will change the concentration of the acetic acid. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH.

The question is about pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So I need to calculate both.

Let me break it down into parts.

Part 1: pH at 25% titration.
Part 2: pH at equivalence point.

Starting with Part 1: 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of what? Oh, I think it's 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So first, I need to find the equivalence point volume.

To find the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added should equal moles of acetic acid originally present.

Wait, but after dilution, the acetic acid concentration is lower. Let me calculate the initial moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid before dilution: Molarity * Volume = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 0.05 M, 20 cm³. Diluting with 20 cm³ of water. So the new volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 0.020 L) / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant.

So after dilution, the acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. The solution is 40 cm³.

When titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid present are 0.001 mol (from 0.05 M * 0.020 L). So the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal 0.001 mol.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Now, the next step is to calculate the pH at this point.

Hmm. So, at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The solution at this point will be a buffer solution, a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how much acetic acid and acetate is present at 25% titration.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. NaOH added is 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M, which is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid (HA) will decrease by 0.00025 mol, and moles of acetate (A-) will increase by the same amount.

So, moles of HA after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
Moles of A-: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the solution's total volume is original solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M approx.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pKa is given by the formula pKa = -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5.

Calculating pKa: log(1.85e-5). Let's think, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Then, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) 
= 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )
What's 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26.

So that's the pH at 25% titration. Looking at the options, the first part of the answer should be around 4.26.

Looking at the options: option A is 4.26 and 8.52; option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation says pH = pKa + log (nA-/nHA), but since the volume is same for both, the ratio of concentrations is same as ratio of moles. So, the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So log(1/3) = log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So approximately 4.26. So the first part must be around 4.26.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form acetate ions and water. So the solution contains sodium acetate in solution, which will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

So, the solution at equivalence point will be from the acetate ion acting as a base.

So, first, calculate the concentration of acetate ions.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol (as before). So the total volume will be initial solution (40 cm³) + NaOH added (10 cm³) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Acetate ion (CH3COO-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is approximately 5.405e-10.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction can be represented as:

B- + H2O ↔ HB + OH-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. Since Kb is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than initial concentration, so:

[OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) where C is the concentration of acetate.

C is 0.02 M.

So [OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 (since 1e-5 is pH 5, 1.04 is slightly higher than 1e-5, so pOH is about 4.98).

pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 -4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait, none of the options have a pH around 9.02 at equivalence. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52
Option B: 3.17;6.73
Option C:4.73;7.00
Option D:4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of them match 9.02. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating Kb or the concentration.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

At equivalence, moles of acetate = 0.001 mol, volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So [A-] = 0.02 M. Correct.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10.

Yes.

Then, Kb = [HB][OH-]/[B-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is 4.98, pH is ~9.02.

But the options don't have anything near 9. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't just sodium acetate. Oh wait, sodium is a spectator ion, so yes, the solution is sodium acetate.

Wait, unless there's an error in the way I calculated the moles or concentration.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I forgot that in the equivalence point, when all the acid is neutralized, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base, but perhaps I should account for the dilution correctly.

Wait, let me re-calculate the acetate concentration.

Moles of NaOH at equivalence: 0.001 mol. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate.

So moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. The total solution volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH added) = 50 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

So why is the pH not matching any options? Did I make a mistake in the Kb calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

Calculate 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. That's 1/(1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M, Kb is 5.405e-10.

So the OH- concentration is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH ≈9.02.

But no option has pH of ~9.02. The options' equivalence point pHs are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for weak base pH correctly.

Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis reaction for acetate is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02, [CH3COOH] =0, [OH^-] =0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small).

[CH3COOH] = x.
[OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02) =5.405e-10.

x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe the initial concentration after dilution is wrong.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then 20 cm³ water is added. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M *0.02 L) / 0.04 L = (0.001 mol)/0.04 L =0.025 M. Correct.

So moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol.

So equivalence point is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not just acetate ions but also including the sodium ions, but sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH, so that's not the issue.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the acetic acid is being titrated in the diluted solution, but maybe I made a mistake in considering the dilution. Let me go back.

Wait, the original solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to account for the dilution in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, no. Because the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol regardless of the concentration. So when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed is 10 cm³. Correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should use the concentration of the resulting solution after adding NaOH. Wait, but no, after equivalence, all the acid is neutralized and the solution is acetate in water.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution also contains some sodium ions, but sodium is a strong ion and doesn't affect pH.

Another possibility: Maybe I should use the exact value of Kb without the approximation, but that shouldn't make such a big difference.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Kb =5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log10(1.04e-5) = 4.98.

pH=14-4.98=9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made an error in another part.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of acetic acid.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

So equivalence point is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not just acetate ions, but I forgot about the activity coefficients? No, that's way beyond the scope of this problem.

Wait, another thought: when you dilute a weak acid, its dissociation increases. So maybe the initial assumption that [HA] ≈ initial concentration minus x is not valid? But in the equivalence point calculation, I used the exact approach, so that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration of acetate at equivalence point.

Wait, acetate concentration: 0.001 mol, 0.05 L → 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that I didn't account for the autoionization of water. No, that's negligible.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the pH at the equivalence point as 7, but that's only the case for strong acid-strong base titrations. Since acetic acid is weak, the equivalence point is basic, so pH >7.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → equivalence pH is 8.52, which is less than 9.02.

Option D: 4.57;6.92 → equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic, which can't be right because equivalence point for a weak acid is basic.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point. Another approach: maybe the solution isn't just acetate, but includes something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the exact expression without approximations.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

Setting up the equation:

x²/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, which is what I did before. So x ≈ sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5, leading to pH ~9.02.

Hmm, but maybe the problem is that I miscalculated the initial moles or the concentration.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, which is correct. So the moles are 0.001 mol.

Wait, going back to the options, none have pH of ~9 at equivalence point. So maybe I messed up the calculation of the moles at equivalence.

Wait, wait a second. How much NaOH is needed for equivalence? 0.001 mol of NaOH.

0.1M NaOH → volume needed= 0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³.

Yes. So that is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should re-examine the problem statement. Oh wait, the question says "dilute 20.00 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water".

So the initial volume is 20 cm³, adding 20 cm³ of water. So total 40 cm³.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the solution after dilution.

Wait, let me compute the concentrations at 25% and equivalence point again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial solution after dilution is not 0.025 M.

Wait, 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the 25% titration refers to 25% of the initial volume of acetic acid. No, I think it's 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, another possible mistake: when calculating pH at 25% titration, perhaps I should have considered the initial solution's pH before any NaOH is added.

Wait, no. The 25% is the fraction of the NaOH added, not the initial solution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial solution's pH was considered, but no, the pH after adding 25% of the NaOH is what's needed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equivalence point pH calculation in another way. Maybe using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula for pH at equivalence point when a weak acid is titrated with a strong base is:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2.

Wait, no. More accurately, pH = pKa + (pKw - pKa)/2 → pH = (pKa + pKw)/2.

Wait, because at equivalence point, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base, which has a Kb, and Kb = Kw / Ka.

Wait, or perhaps I can calculate pH using the relation:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

At equivalence, [A-] is (n / V_total), but [HA] is zero? No, wait, at equivalence, all HA is converted to A-. So [A-] = 0.02 M, and [HA] is negligible, but in reality, it's zero, which would make log(0) undefined. So that approach isn't correct.

Wait, another approach: the solution at equivalence is a solution of acetate, which is a weak base. So the pH can be found by considering the hydrolysis of acetate as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, Kb =5.405e-10. C=0.02.

Using the exact formula:

x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x≈sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. So [OH-]=1.04e-5, pOH=4.98.

pH=14-4.98=9.02. So I think my earlier calculation is correct.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest equivalence point pH is option A:8.52. But my calculation is 9.02.

Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I flipped Ka and Kb somewhere. Wait, no, I used Kb = Kw / Ka.

Wait, another approach: using the pH formula for a solution of a weak base.

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, no. At equivalence, it's just the base, so [acid]=0. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

So, the equivalence point is 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, if the problem is the total volume, perhaps I should also consider that the NaOH solution is being added to the diluted acetic acid. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³.

Yes, which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to account for the fact that NaOH is a strong base and dissociates completely, but I think that's already considered.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is being heated, but the problem states 25°C, which is standard.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb. Let me recalculate it.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH using the formula for a buffer solution, but that's only applicable before the equivalence point. After that, it's a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH using the exact value, but I can't see where I went wrong.

Wait, looking at the options again, option A has pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. My calculation for 25% is 4.26, which matches option A.

But the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation of 9.02.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the solution at the equivalence point as a 0.02 M solution of sodium acetate, but the pH is calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the exact solution for the hydrolysis.

The equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentrations:

[CH3COO^-] =0.02 M; [CH3COOH]=0; [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-]=0.02 -x; [CH3COOH]=x; [OH^-]=x.

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

But perhaps the problem assumes that the solution is approximated in a different way, or perhaps the wrong Ka was used.

Wait, the problem gives the Ka as 1.85e-5, which I used. So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at equivalence point, but that's not possible because [HA] is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the buffer approach is not applicable, as I've already considered.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the solution at equivalence point as a solution of sodium acetate, but uses the formula for a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, which I did.

I think I'm correct, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first part.

Wait, let me recheck the 25% titration calculation.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L= 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of HA after reaction:0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of A-:0.00025 mol.

Total volume:40 cm³ +2.5 cm³=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) =4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) =4.733 + log(0.333).

log(0.333)=-0.477. So pH=4.733-0.477=4.256≈4.26.

So that part's correct, which matches option A and D.

Wait, option D has pH at 25% as 4.57, which is higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error there.

Wait, let me recompute [A-] and [HA].

Moles after reaction:

HA: 0.00075 mol.

A-:0.00025 mol.

Volume: 42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425 =0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

Ratio [A-]/[HA]=0.005882/0.017647≈0.333.

Log(0.333)= -0.477.

pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256. So 4.26.

So the first part is 4.26, which is option A (4.26,8.52) and option D (4.57,6.92) is 4.57.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio of A- to HA.

Wait, 0.00025 /0.00075 =1/3, so log(1/3)= -0.477.

Yes.

So the first part is correct.

So perhaps the options have a mistake, but the problem gives options, so perhaps I should look for the option that matches the first part and the equivalence point.

But none match the equivalence point.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution after equivalence is not 0.02 M acetate, but different.

Wait, no. The moles are 0.001, and the volume is 50 cm³, so 0.001/0.05=0.02 M.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, and the pH at equivalence is given by:

pH = 14 - 0.5 (pKa - pKw) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula pH = pKa + log (n_base / n_acid), but that's the buffer region.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the solution as a buffer when not all the acid is neutralized. But that's not the case at equivalence.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact value without the approximation.

Wait, but when [HA] is much larger than [A-], the approximation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression.

Wait, let's try that.

At equivalence point:

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) =1.04e-5. As before.

So, [OH-] is 1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula to find pH at equivalence point. Let me think again.

At equivalence point, solution is CH3COO^- in water. So using the formula:

pH = 14 - 0.5 (pKa + pKw) ?

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, pH = pKa2 of water? No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH using a different method, like the exact quadratic equation.

Wait, let's try that.

The Kb equation:

x^2 = Kb * (0.02) → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) =sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

Which gives pH=9.02.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution in the equivalence point calculation. No, that can't be, because at equivalence point, all the acid is converted to its conjugate base.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the concentration of the initial solution before dilution. But that's not correct, because the solution has been diluted.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

My calculation for 25% is 4.26, which matches. But the equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is much lower than my calculation.

Hmm. 8.52 is lower than 9.02, meaning the solution is less basic than I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kb =1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles were calculated incorrectly. Let me recheck.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol. Correct.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added=0.00025 mol. So moles of HA=0.00075, A-=0.00025.

Wait, perhaps the total volume is 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³=42.5 cm³.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

So ratio [A-]/[HA]= (0.005882)/(0.017647)=0.333.

So pH= pKa + log(0.333)=4.733 -0.477=4.256 →4.26.

So that's correct.

At equivalence point, the pH is 9.02, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution after equivalence is not 0.02 M acetate, but I have another mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a weak base's pH, but I think I did that.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the Kb is correct.

Wait, Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

So Kb for acetate is 1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10.

Yes.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence point as (pKa + pKw)/2.

Wait, pKa is 4.733, pKw is 14. So (4.733 +14)/2= 18.733/2=9.3665.

Which is close to my calculated pH of 9.02.

Wait, but no option is near 9.36.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate it as (pH= pKa2 + pKa1)/2), but I don't think that's correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, but I can't be certain.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So if my 25% is correct, perhaps the equivalence point is 8.52 due to some miscalculation.

How could I get 8.52?

Wait, let's see.

If I have pH=8.52, then pOH=14-8.52=5.48 → [OH-]=2.63e-6 M.

So Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-] = (2.63e-6)^2 /0.02= (6.9169e-12)/0.02=3.458e-10.

But the correct Kb is 5.405e-10, which is higher than 3.458e-10.

So that would suggest that the acetate concentration is higher, which isn't the case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the initial concentration after dilution is different.

Wait, initial solution: 0.05 M acetic acid, 20 cm³. Dilute with 20 cm³ of water → total 40 cm³.

Concentration after dilution: (0.05 *20)/(40)=0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the solution after 25% titration in a different way. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps in the 25% titration, the volume is 25% of the equivalence point volume, which is 10 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH without considering the dilution of the added NaOH.

No, because the volume of NaOH is added to the solution, so the total volume increases.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. But given that the first part of option A matches my calculation, perhaps the answer is option A, even though the equivalence point doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula for the pH at equivalence point as:

pH = 14 - pKa.

Wait, because:

At equivalence, the solution is a weak base, and pH = 14 - pKa.

pKa is 4.73, so pH=14-4.73=9.27. Closer to my calculation of 9.02.

But 9.27 isn't in the options either.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses an approximation for the equivalence point pH.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the solution is 0.02 M acetate, and uses the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKw).

Which would be pH= (4.733 +14)/2= 9.3665.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'll look for another approach.

Another approach for equivalence point pH:

At equivalence point, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of acetate.

Using the formula:

pH = pKa + log( [A-]/[HA] )

But at equivalence, [HA] is zero, which is undefined. So that's not applicable.

Alternatively, using the formula for a weak base:

pOH = ½ (pKb + pKw)

Wait, pKb= log(1/(Ka))= log(1/1.85e-5) → pKb= log(5.405e4)= 4.733.

Wait, no. Wait, pKb is -log(Kb).

Kb=5.405e-10 → pKb=9.266.

So, using pOH=½ (pKb + pKw) → pOH= ½ (9.266 +14 )=½ (23.266)=11.633.

pH=14-11.633=2.367. No, that can't be right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and choose the option that matches the 25% titration value.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, which matches my calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is A, even though the equivalence point doesn't match.

But then why the equivalence point is 8.52 in option A?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't dilute the acetic acid, but I don't think so because the question says it does.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the dilution when calculating the equivalence point.

Wait, that would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what was done.

If I ignore the dilution, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, 20 cm³. Moles are 0.001 mol. Equivalence point volume is 10 cm³. So same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence point using the initial concentration before dilution. But that would be incorrect.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the 25% titration is 4.26, and the equivalence point is around 9.02, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but among the options, option A's 25% is correct, and the equivalence point is perhaps a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pH at equivalence point is 8.52, which would imply that the [OH-] is 3e-6 M. Let me see:

If pH=8.52, then [H+]=3.02e-9 M.

pOH=14-8.52=5.48 → [OH-]=2.63e-6 M.

Then, Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-] = (2.63e-6)^2 /0.02= (6.9169e-12)/0.02=3.458e-10.

But the actual Kb is 5.405e-10, which is higher.

So, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the volume. Let me recheck.

At equivalence point, the volume is 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH using the formula pH = pKa + log (n_base / n_acid), but that's only for buffers.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at equivalence point, but that's incorrect because [HA] is zero.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all possible approaches. Given that my 25% titration pH is 4.26 and the equivalence point is around 9.02, but the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, 4.57 is higher than my 4.26, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact Henderson-Hasselbalch equation without the assumption that x is small.

Wait, but in the buffer region, the approximation holds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the initial concentration before dilution in the 25% calculation. Let me see.

If initial acetic acid is 0.05 M, 20 cm³. Dilute with 20 cm³ water → 40 cm³. So 0.025 M.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles of NaOH:0.00025 mol.

Moles of HA:0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Volume:42.5 cm³.

[HA]=0.00075/0.0425=0.017647 M.

[A-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH= pKa + log(0.005882/0.017647)=4.733 + log(0.333)=4.733-0.477=4.256. So 4.26.

Thus, the first part is correct.

So, given that, the answer must be option A or D. But option D's first pH is 4.57, which is higher than 4.26.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the buffer pH. Let me recompute using more precise values.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

n_A- =0.00025 mol, n_HA=0.00075 mol.

Volume=0.0425 L.

So [A-]=0.00025 /0.0425= 0.005882 M.

[HA]=0.00075/0.0425=0.017647 M.

Ratio [A-]/[HA]= (0.005882)/(0.017647)=0.33333.

Log(0.33333)= -0.4771.

So pH=4.733 -0.4771=4.2559 →4.26.

So that's correct.

Thus, the only option that matches the first part is option A and D.

Option A: 4.26;8.52.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

But none have the equivalence point correct.

Hmm.

Given all this, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the pH at 25% of the initial volume, not the equivalence point. That would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to not dilute the solution before titration. Let's see.

If I don't dilute, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, 20 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: same as before.

Wait, no, the problem says we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water.

So, I think the correct approach is as I did, but the options don't match. Perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other approaches.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at 25% of the initial solution's volume, not the equivalence point.

Wait, the problem says 25% titration, which usually refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for 25% of the initial solution's volume. So 25% of 40 cm³ is 10 cm³ of NaOH added. But that's the equivalence point, which we already considered.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the first part is 4.26, and the equivalence point is about 9.02, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the concentration of 0.025 M acetic acid and ignore the dilution when adding NaOH, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.001 mol.

Yes.

At 25% titration: 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH →0.00025 mol.

So, moles of HA:0.00075, A-:0.00025.

Volume:42.5 cm³.

Thus, [HA]=0.017647, [A-]=0.005882.

Ratio 0.333.

pH=4.26. So option A's first part is correct.

Since none of the options have the correct equivalence point, and the first part is correct, perhaps the intended answer is option A, and the equivalence point in the option is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence point as 8.52, but I can't see how.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at equivalence point, but that's not applicable.

Hmm.

I think I have to go with option A, even though the equivalence point doesn't match my calculation. Or perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but among the options, option A's first part matches.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Part 1: pH at 25% Titration
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Moles of acetic acid initially:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
     \]
   - After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³. The new concentration of acetic acid is:  
     \[
     \text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
     \]

2. **25% Titration**:  
   - At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached.  
   - The equivalence point volume is calculated by neutralizing all 0.001 mol of acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH:  
     \[
     V_{\text{eq}} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
     \]
   - At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is:  
     \[
     V_{\text{25%}} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
     \]
   - Moles of NaOH added:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
     \]
   - After the reaction, moles of acetic acid (\( \text{HA} \)) and acetate (\( \text{A}^- \)) are:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of HA} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
     \]
     \[
     \text{Moles of A}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
     \]
   - Total volume of the solution:  
     \[
     V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
     \]
   - Concentrations of \( \text{HA} \) and \( \text{A}^- \):  
     \[
     [\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
     \]
   - Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
     \]
     where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \).  
     Substituting the values:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
     \]

### Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point
1. **Equivalence Point**:  
   - At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ions.  
   - Total volume of the solution:  
     \[
     V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
     \]
   - Concentration of acetate ions:  
     \[
     [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
     \]
   - Acetate ions act as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:  
     \[
     \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
     \]
   - The \( K_b \) for acetate is:  
     \[
     K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
     \]
   - Using the approximation for weak bases:  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
     \]
   - pOH:  
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
     \]
   - pH:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
     \]

### Conclusion
The calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, which matches option A. However, the calculated pH at the equivalence point is **9.02**, which does not match any of the provided options. Among the given choices, option A is the most consistent with the calculations for the 25% titration.

**Answer: A**
