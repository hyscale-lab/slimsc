Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take my time and think this through.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and a compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the options given.

First, let me try to visualize what's happening in the reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a cyclic amine—specifically a five-membered ring with one nitrogen and a methyl group on the third carbon. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Breaking that down, it seems like a cyclohexylmethylene group is attached to the pyrrolidine ring at position 1.

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl... that's like a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene or something. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexylidene group is a substituent attached via a methylene group (CH₂) to the pyrrolidine.

I remember that when amines react with carbonyl compounds under acid catalysis, they can undergo various reactions. One possibility is the formation of enamines. Enamines are typically formed from an amine reacting with a ketone or aldehyde, followed by elimination to form a conjugated amine (enamine).

So, the reaction might be forming an enamine. Let me think about how that works. Enamine synthesis generally involves two steps: first, the formation of a Schiff base, and then the elimination of water to form the double bond, creating the enamine. This elimination step usually requires an acid catalyst and sometimes heat.

In this case, the starting amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine. To form an enamine, it would react with a carbonyl compound (like an aldehyde or ketone) to form a Schiff base, and then lose water to form the double bond.

Looking at the product structure, the substituent on the pyrrolidine is cyclohexylidenemethyl. That suggests that the enamine has a cyclohexene ring attached. So, the carbonyl compound (A) must be derived from a cyclohexene group.

Wait, what's the structure of the product?
