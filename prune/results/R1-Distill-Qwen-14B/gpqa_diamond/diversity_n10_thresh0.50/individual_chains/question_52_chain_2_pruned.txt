Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that when stars have spots, it can affect their observed temperature and emission.

Alright, the star's parameters: it has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But wait, the key points are about the effective temperature. When the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star's temperature is lower when spots are present.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”specifically, the ratio when no spots are present compared to when spots are present.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation because we're dealing with the distribution of atoms in energy levels under LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), which is given in the problem.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by the thermal energy. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower. So perhaps the temperature is lower, which would affect the exponent in the Boltzmann factor.

But wait, wait. The star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature when spots are present. The spots are cooler, so parts of the surface are at lower temperatures, and others are at higher. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Oh, but the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So I think we can model the photosphere
