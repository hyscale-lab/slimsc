Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data given are IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's look at the IR first. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But since we don't have any info about amines here, maybe it's an acid, or maybe an alcohol or phenol. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretches, so there's probably a benzene ring involved.

Now looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid, but their protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. But since the IR shows a peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl for a ketone or aldehyde. Let me think: aldehydes have a strong absorption around
