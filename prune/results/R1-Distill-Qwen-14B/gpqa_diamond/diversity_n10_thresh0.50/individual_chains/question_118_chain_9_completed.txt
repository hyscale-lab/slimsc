Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I need to figure out what the major outcome is.

Wait, first I should probably recall what kind of reactions bromine typically undergoes with enols. Oh right, enols are compounds that have an adjacent -OH group and a double bond. They can undergo various addition reactions. But wait, bromine is Br2, which is a dienophile maybe? Or is it more about addition to double bonds?

Wait, no, bromine can add to double bonds in a dibromination. Oh, right, when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), it's usually an addition reaction where each bromine atom adds to opposite ends of the double bond. But wait, the starting material here is an enol, which is a cyclopentene ring with an -OH group attached. Oh, the structure is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the cyclopentene ring has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, I think. And the enol has an -OH group on carbon 1, with two methyl groups on carbon 4.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol means the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl is on C1. So the structure is a five-membered ring, with a double bond starting at C1, and an -OH on C1 as well. So the structure is like O=C-OH attached to C1, but wait, no—enol is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. Wait, the enol structure is an alcohol (OH) attached to a carbon that is adjacent to a double bond. So in this case, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the cyclopentene is numbered such that the double bond is between C1 and C2. The enol group is -OH on C1. So carbon 1 has both the OH and the double bond. So when you look at the structure, it's a five-membered ring: C1 is connected to C2 (double bond), C5, and the OH. C1 also has a single bond to C5, which is part of the ring. Then, C4 has two methyl groups.

So, when bromine (Br2) reacts with such an enol, what happens? Well, bromine can react with the double bond in an addition reaction. Since the enol is in a conjugated system, perhaps the reaction could involve some sort of conjugation, but I think the main reaction here is the diaddition of Br2 across the double bond.

Wait, but wait—another possibility. Enols are known to undergo some kind of conjugate additions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the double bond is more reactive because of the adjacent hydroxyl group. So when Br2 is added, it would add across the double bond, leading to the formation of a dibromide.

But wait, another thought: cyclopentene rings can undergo ring-opening reactions, especially under certain conditions. But I don't think that's the case here. The question is about addition, not ring-opening.

So, Br2 would react with the double bond. The reaction is likely to proceed via an electrophilic addition mechanism. The bromine molecule is a di-electrophile, and the alkene would attack first with Br+ or perhaps Br2 opens up to form a bromonium ion intermediate.

Wait, but in the case of enol, the addition might be influenced by the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent hydroxyl group. Wait, the hydroxyl is an electron-withdrawing group. So the double bond is more electron-rich, making it more reactive towards electrophilic addition.

So bromine would add across the double bond, leading to vicinal dibromide. So in this case, the double bond between C1 and C2 would be converted into a single bond with Br atoms on each of those carbons.

So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, right? But wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2, and an -OH group on C1, and two methyl groups on C4.

After adding Br2, the double bond is gone, and each of C1 and C2 have a Br. So the ring would now be cyclopentane, with Br on C1 and C2, and the OH still on C1, and two methyl on C4.

Wait, but wait. The enol would now have Br substituents on C1 and C2. So the structure would be 1-bromo-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol? Wait, no, because it's a vicinal dibromide. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, and option D is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-...

So the question is about the configuration of the Br atoms. When Br2 adds to a double bond, the addition is anti. So the Br atoms add to opposite faces.

Wait, the starting material is an enol, which is planar around the double bond. So when Br adds, the two Br atoms would come from the same face or opposite? Wait, the addition of Br2 to an alkene is typically a bromonium ion formation, which leads to the anti addition.

Wait, for cyclopropane alkenes, the addition would lead to the Brs being on opposite sides. So in the cyclopentene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. When Br2 adds, the Brs would be on opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration.

But what's the configuration of the starting material? Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the substituents are at C4: two methyl groups, and the enol is at C1 and C2.

After addition, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, with anti configuration.

But the product options are about the stereochemistry. Let's think about the product.

The starting compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the ring is in a certain conformation. When Br adds, the Brs will add across the double bond in a trans fashion, leading to the dibromide.

But wait, the enol is a cyclopentene with an -OH on C1. So when Br adds to C1 and C2, the OH group is also on C1. So the product would have Br on C1, OH on C1, and Br on C2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if both Br and OH are on C1, that's possible? Or is the addition across the double bond, so C1 and C2 each get a Br.

Wait, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2. When Br adds, each Br adds to each carbon of the double bond. So C1 gets a Br, and C2 gets a Br. The OH is on C1, so the product would have a Br on C1 and another on C2, with the OH still on C1.

So the structure would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Looking at the options:

Option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option D is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So the question is about the configuration—whether the Brs are on the same face or opposite.

But wait, in the addition of Br2, the di bromide adds in a trans manner because of the bromonium ion intermediate. So the two Brs are added with anti stereochemistry.

Wait, considering the original structure, the OH is on C1, which is part of the enol. When the Br adds, the two Brs are on opposite sides.

But wait, the ring is cyclopentane, so the addition would lead to the Brs on adjacent carbons but in a trans arrangement.

Wait, how would that look?

The starting material has the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. So the substituents around the double bond would be: on C1, the OH is on one side, and the ring (C5) on the other. On C2, the substituent is the ring (probably C3).

When adding Br2, the bromine adds across the double bond. The Br atoms add from opposite sides because the bromonium ion opens in a way that leads to anti addition.

So in the product, the Br on C1 and the Br on C2 would be on opposite faces.

But how does that translate to the configuration (R or S)?

Wait, perhaps the product is a diastereomer. Let me try to imagine the structure. The cyclopentane ring has the OH on C1, Br on C1, and Br on C2.

Wait, but wait—can a carbon have three substituents besides the ring? Let me think. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two other ring carbons. For C1, the substituents are:

- OH group,
- Br,
- and two ring connections (C5 and C2).

Wait, no, each ring carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons in the ring. So for C1, substituents are OH, Br, and two ring bonds. Wait, that's three substituents plus the ring, but each carbon in the ring has four bonds, so that's correct.

Wait, but when adding Brs to C1 and C2, each will have two Brs? No, each will have one Br. So C1 has OH, Br, and two ring bonds (but in a cyclopentane, each ring bond is a single bond, so in the product, the ring becomes a single bond with Brs on C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But looking at the options, that's what options A and D are. So I need to determine the stereochemistry.

In the addition of Br2 to a double bond, the Brs add anti to each other. So for the cyclopentene, the initial double bond is between C1 and C2. So when the Brs add, they are on opposite sides.

In terms of the configuration, the starting material's double bond would have the substituents (OH on C1 and the ring on C2) in a certain arrangement. When Br adds, the two Brs will be on opposite faces.

Wait, but the starting material is a cyclopentenol. So, the double bond is CH(OH)-CH2... No, wait, the structure is a five-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. So C1 has the OH, and C2 is connected to C3 and C1.

Wait, perhaps drawing a rough structure would help, but since I can't draw, I'll visualize.

In any case, when Br adds to the double bond, each Br is on opposite sides. So the configuration around C1 and C2 would be trans.

So for C1, the OH is on one face, and Br on the opposite. For C2, the Br is on the opposite face relative to the substituent on C2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the specific configuration of the product.

But wait, another possibility: the enol can undergo a ring-opening via bromine. But that's probably not the case here because Br2 is more about addition to the double bond.

Wait, another possibility is that the enol might undergo some kind of keto-enol tautomerism, but I don't think that's relevant here. The reaction is with Br2, which would proceed via the double bond.

So, the main product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Now, considering the stereoisomerism.

The starting material is a trans or cis dienol? Wait, wait, the starting material is a cyclopentenol, which is a cyclic enol. In the case of a cyclopentenol, the hydroxyl group is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the configuration of the starting material would have the OH group on C1 and adjacent to the double bond.

But since it's a five-membered ring, the substituents around the double bond are such that the dihedral angle is fixed. So the addition of Br would proceed with anti addition.

Thus, the Brs would end up on opposite sides.

But how does that affect the configuration of the product?

Let's consider the configuration of C1 and C2 in the product.

For the cyclopentane ring, the substituents around each carbon are the Br, OH (only C1), and the adjacent ring carbons.

Wait, but for each carbon (C1 and C2), the Br is added in a way that causes the stereochemistry.

But wait, since the addition is anti, the Br on C1 and C2 will be on opposite sides relative to each other.

In terms of R/S configuration, we can assign based on the priorities.

For C1: substituents are OH, Br, and two CH2 groups (ring carbons). The substituents in order of priority: OH (highest), Br, then the two ring bonds (which are equal, so order doesn't matter for stereochemistry).

For C2: substituents are Br, and three ring bonds (but wait, no—C2 is connected to C1, C3, and another substituent?)

Wait, no. C2 is connected to C1, C3, and any substituents. In the product, C2 has a Br and is connected to C1 and C3, and the other ring carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the molecule.

After adding Br to C1 and C2, the Brs are on opposite faces. So, for C1, the Br is on one face, and for C2, the Br is on the opposite face.

But wait, the starting material is a cyclic enol, so the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

When Br adds across the double bond, the Br on C1 would be on the same face as the OH, and the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Since the addition is anti, the Brs would be on opposite sides. So if the OH is on the top face of C1, the Br on C1 would be on the bottom (since the addition leads to Br on opposite sides).

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let's think about the geometry of the starting alkene.

The starting material is cyclopent-1-enol. The enol has a double bond between C1 and C2, with the OH on C1.

In the case of a cyclopentenol, the ring is in a chair-like or boat-like conformation, but for small rings like cyclopentane, it's more puckered.

But for the sake of determining the addition, perhaps it's better to consider the double bond as a planar structure, with the substituents on either side.

The bromine adds in a way that the two Brs are on opposite sides (anti addition). So, the Br on C1 and the Br on C2 are trans to each other.

So, considering the starting material, the OH is on C1, which is on one face of the double bond. The Br on C1 would be on the opposite face of the OH, and the Br on C2 would be on the same face as the adjacent substituent.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use a specific example. Let's imagine the cyclopentene ring with the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1, let's say on the top face. The Br will add to the same face as the OH, or the opposite?

Wait, no. Because when Br2 adds, the Brs add on opposite sides. So, for the double bond, if the OH is on the top of C1, the Br on C1 would be added to the bottom (because the Brs come in from opposite sides). Similarly, the Br on C2 would be added to the top face.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The bromonium ion forms when Br2 reacts with the double bond. The ring opens with Br attacking from the opposite side, leading to anti addition.

So, if the starting double bond has the OH on C1 on the top face, and the other substituents (like the adjacent ring carbons) on the bottom, then the Br would add to the bottom of C1 and the top of C2.

Wait, that might result in the Br on C1 being on the opposite side of the OH, and the Br on C2 being on the same side as the adjacent substituent.

But without knowing the exact geometry of the starting material, perhaps it's hard to assign the exact configuration. However, in the product, the Brs are on opposite sides, leading to a specific stereochemistry.

Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S) and option D is (1R,2R).

Wait, another approach: maybe the addition leads to the formation of a diastereomer or an epoxide? No, it's a dibromide.

Alternatively, perhaps after the addition, the molecule can undergo an acid-catalyzed ring opening, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could react with bromine in a different way. Enols can sometimes react with electrophiles in conjugate addition, but I think in this case, the diene is more reactive, so the main reaction is addition across the double bond.

So the major product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol with a specific stereochemistry.

But which option is correct? Options A and D are the only ones with 1,2 dibromo and OH.

Wait, but another possibility: the reaction could be a bromohydrination, but that's when water is present, which it isn't here. So it's more about addition of Br2.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to the vicinal dibromide, and the configuration depends on the addition's anti fashion.

Wait, perhaps the product is a meso compound, but looking at the options, the options don't have that. So perhaps the Brs are on adjacent carbons in a trans configuration.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the possible diastereomers.

If the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, then adding Br across C1 and C2 anti would result in the Brs being trans to each other.

But how does that translate into the R/S configuration? Let me imagine C1 and C2.

For C1, substituents are:

1. OH (highest priority)
2. Br (second)
3. Two ring bonds (same, so third and fourth)

Wait, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH (priority 1)
- Br (priority 2)
- CH2- (from the ring, priority 3)
- CH2- (from the ring, priority 3)

Wait, but when determining the configuration, you look at the four groups around the carbon. So, for C1, the four groups are:

1. OH
2. Br
3. C5 (ring)
4. C2 (ring)

Wait, no. Each ring carbon is connected to two other ring carbons. So, the substituents on C1 are OH, Br, and two ring bonds (to C5 and C2). Similarly, C2 has Br, and three ring bonds (to C1, C3, and another which would be C4? No, the ring is five-membered.)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product would have both Brs on the same face, leading to a cis configuration, but then the addition of Br2 is usually trans.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the enol reacts in a way that the OH group is deprotonated, making it more nucleophilic, but I don't think that's the case here. Bromine is more of an electrophile.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an example of allylic bromination, but that usually involves a different mechanism, like using a peroxide or NBS, and it's a radical mechanism. I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but the starting material is an enol, which is typically more reactive towards electrophilic attack. But the presence of Br2 suggests an addition across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. The options are:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

Options B and C suggest a ketone formation, which would involve a ring-opening or some oxidation. But the starting material is an enol, which is an alcohol. So adding Br2 wouldn't directly lead to a ketone unless there's an elimination followed by some oxidation, which I don't think is the case here.

So, options B and C are probably not the major products, unless the reaction involves oxidation, but the question doesn't mention any oxidizing agents besides Br2.

Thus, the major product is likely a vicinal dibromide with OH, which are options A and D.

So, the product is either A or D.

Now, the question is about the configuration. Since the addition is anti, the Brs are on opposite sides.

But what is the configuration of each center?

Let's imagine the cyclopentane ring. Let's say C1 has the OH group on the top face. The Br on C1 would be added on the bottom face (since addition is anti). Similarly, the Br on C2 would be added on the top face.

Wait, but how does that affect the chirality?

For C1: substituents are OH (top), Br (bottom), C5 (left), and C2 (right). The priority order is OH (1), Br (2), then the two ring bonds (3 and 4). To determine R/S, we look at the order of substituents around the carbon.

The arrangement would be: OH (1), Br (2), C5 (3), and C2 (4). If the Br is on the bottom, then looking from the priority 1 (OH) to 2 (Br), the order would be considered as the direction of the other substituents.

Wait, perhaps using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the configuration can be determined.

But without a clear model, perhaps it's easier to think that the addition leads to a specific diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product will have the Brs in a trans configuration, leading to either (R,S) or (R,R), but I'm not sure.

Another approach: when the Brs are added anti, the two Brs are on opposite sides of the ring.

Assuming that, the configuration would be such that C1 and C2 each have the Br on opposite faces.

So, for C1, perhaps the Br is on the same face as the adjacent substituent, but it's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the product will have the Brs on the same side of the ring. No, because addition is anti, so they are on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecule as a cyclopentane ring. The Br on C1 is on the top face, and the Br on C2 is on the bottom face. Or vice versa.

But how does that translate to R and S configurations?

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is a trans-dibromide, leading to an (R,S) configuration, which would be option A.

But I'm not entirely certain, but given the options, I think option A is the correct one, but I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is both R, leading to option D.

Wait, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on the same face, but that would be a cis addition, which isn't the case with Br2 addition.

Wait, no. Br2 addition is anti, so the Brs are on opposite faces.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the chair conformation, but cyclopentane isn't a six-membered ring so that doesn't apply.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomer formed is (1R,2S), which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound, but that would require the molecule to have a plane of symmetry, which I don't think it does in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't suggest that; they just provide specific configurations.

Wait, maybe the starting material is not chiral. Let's see: the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The substituents on the ring are two methyl groups on C4, the OH on C1, and the double bond.

Is this molecule chiral? Let's see. The enol is on C1, which is connected to C2 (double bond) and C5. The other substituents on C1 are the ring bonds. So, does C1 have four different substituents?

Substituents on C1: OH, C2 (double bond), C5 (single bond), and the other ring bond (C2 is double bond, but it's part of the ring). Wait, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH group
- C2 (as part of the double bond)
- C5 (as a single bond)
- The ring structure (in which case, the substituents might not all be different)

So, perhaps C1 doesn't have four different substituents, making it not a chiral center. Similarly, C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), C3 (single bond), and two ring bonds.

So, the starting material might not be chiral. Thus, the product after addition would have two chiral centers (C1 and C2), and depending on the addition, could be a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

But if the addition is anti, then the Brs would be on opposite sides, leading to a meso compound. But looking at the options, none of them are meso, except perhaps if the configuration leads to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the two chiral centers have opposite configurations (R and S), then the molecule would be meso if there's a plane of symmetry. Let me see: with Brs on C1 and C2, and both having opposite configurations, would it have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, if the molecule is symmetrical, then it would be a meso compound. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the ring, making it a meso compound.

If that's the case, the configuration would be (1R,2S), which is option A.

But wait, the question asks for the major outcome. So if the product is a meso compound, it would be a single compound, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the product isn't a meso compound, it would be a racemic mixture, but the options don't give that.

But the options only have specific configurations, not racemic.

So, putting this all together, the product is a meso compound (1R,2S), which is option A.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol reacting with bromine (Br₂). The starting material is a cyclopentene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. Bromine reacts with the double bond via anti-addition, forming a vicinal dibromide. The anti-addition mechanism results in the bromine atoms being added to opposite faces of the double bond.

The product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with two chiral centers at C1 and C2. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the anti-addition of Br₂. Since the starting material is not chiral, the product can either be a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers. A meso compound arises if there is a plane of symmetry in the molecule, which occurs when the configurations at C1 and C2 are opposite (1R,2S). This configuration corresponds to a meso compound, making it the major product.

Options B and C, which involve ketone formation, are not consistent with the reaction conditions, as no oxidation or ring-opening occurs. Options A and D represent the two possible stereoisomers of the dibromide. However, the anti-addition of Br₂ favors the formation of the meso compound (1R,2S), which is option A.

Answer: A
