Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow. The question involves several reactions, and I need to determine the coupling pattern in the NMR of the final product.

First, let me read the problem again. So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH at 240°C to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding any that exchange with the solvent.

Alright, let's break this down. The first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when a dihalide reacts with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene via elimination. So, perhaps the product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, it would form an alkene between the 1 and 3 positions. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar? Or maybe it's a bridge structure, but I think in this case, elimination would form an exo double bond.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is formed by heating with KOH. Wait, KOH is a strong base, but maybe it's an E2 elimination forming an alkene. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Hmm, maybe product 1 isn't an alkene but something else. Oh! Wait, KOH is a base, but maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihalide elimination forming a ketone. Or maybe it's a ring-opening?

Wait, another thought. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination, the product might not be an alkene but a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think: elimination of two HBr molecules from adjacent carbons would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, but 1,3 positions are not adjacent. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, and the structure of adamantane has a bridge structure. So maybe elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead double bond? Or perhaps a ketone.

Wait, wait. The IR peak at
