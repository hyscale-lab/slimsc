Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, right? I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Okay, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. The question is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, wait. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, that means the probability from x=1 to x=3 must be 1, and zero outside. So we can set up the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 equal to 1, and that should let us solve for 'a'.

Let me write down the wave function again: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the square modulus is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because when you square a complex number, the modulus squared is (real part)^2 plus (imaginary part)^2. Wait, but wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus i*(0.5), so when you square it, you have to compute (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by its complex conjugate, which is (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i). So, |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - bi)(a + bi) = a² + b².

So that's (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.25). Because 0.5 squared is 0.25.

Now, the integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. So,

Integral (from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split this integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding the two parts together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7206.

Then a is the square root of that. What's sqrt(0.7206)?

Well, I know that 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.85^2 is 0.7225. Let me check: 0.85^2 is (85/100)^2 = 7225/10000 = 0.7225. Oh, that's very close to 0.7206. So a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, correct. So yes, the integral becomes as above.

Compute a²:

a²= (0.5) / (ln(2)) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ approximately 0.7206.

So a is sqrt(0.7206) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't forget any constants. Oh, wait,
