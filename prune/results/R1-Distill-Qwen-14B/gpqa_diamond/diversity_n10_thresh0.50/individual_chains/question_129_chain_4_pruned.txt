Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let's see, the question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with E. There are also some hints and the options to choose from. Hmm, I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll try to outline each reaction step to understand what's happening.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups, so maybe A is a ketone or an aldehyde. But wait, when HCN adds to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. So A probably has a carbonyl group. Alternatively, if A is a nitrile, but then HCN might not react that way. Hmm, more likely a carbonyl.

2. Compound B is then reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So B has something that can be hydrogenated. If B is a nitrile (like from HCN addition), then hydrogenation would reduce it to an amine. Wait, but HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin which is an alcohol with a nitrile group. Alternatively, if A is a ketone, B is a cyanohydrin (with -CH(OH)CN structure). Then reducing B with H2 and Pd would probably hydrogenate the nitrile part. Because Pd is usually for hydrogenolysis. So the nitrile (CN) would become CH2NH
