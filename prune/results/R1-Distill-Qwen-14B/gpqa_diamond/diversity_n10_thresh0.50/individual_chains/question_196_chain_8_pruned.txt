Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The options include a relativistic correction, so I need to consider how relativity affects this.

Relativistic effects come into play when the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So in this case, the velocity might need to be adjusted using the Lorentz factor or something related.

In special relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does this tie into the harmonic oscillator?

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2) k x², and at maximum amplitude A, all the energy is potential, so (1/2) k A² = (1/2) m v_max². Solving for v gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C, but that's the non-relativistic answer. So in the relativistic case, this must change.

Wait, the problem says it's a relativistic oscillator. So the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx² anymore? Or maybe
