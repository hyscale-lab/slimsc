Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are for the complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants. Right, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So the higher the β, the more stable the complex. The complexes here are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, no, wait. Cobalt thiocyanato complexes – I think the common ones are the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- which is blue, and [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is maybe another color? Or wait, perhaps the complexes are different. Oh wait, the stability constants are given for each step
