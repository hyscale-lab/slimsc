Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The first part asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, I need to figure out what this operator looks like and its eigenstates.

Wait, also, after finding the probabilities, I have to find the average value of that operator. So, two main tasks: probabilities and expectation value.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's normalize the state |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, so I'll need to compute the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let's calculate the inner product.

The state can be written as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i), b= (2 -i). The inner product is a* a + b* b.

Wait, no, actually, the inner product is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So compute |a|^2: (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 +1 =2.

Similarly, |b|^2: (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 + (i)(-i) + 2i -2i? Wait wait, no. Let me compute (2 - i)(2 +i) = 2² + (i)(2) - (i)(2) + (i)(i) ?

Wait, actually, (a - b)(a + b) = a² + b². No, wait, no. Wait, (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², but in this case, a is 2 and b is i. So (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5. Oh right, that's easier. So |b|^2 is 5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Now, the operator given has a matrix representation A where A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j, and zero otherwise. Wait, in 2x2 matrix terms, since the states are |up> and |down>, the operator matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because for i≠j, it's hbar/2, and diagonal elements are zero.

Wait, wait, no: the operator is defined as A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So the matrix is:

A = [ [0, (hbar/2)],
       [(hbar/2), 0] ]

So that's the operator matrix. Now, this operator probably corresponds to some observable. Since the matrix is 2x2 and symmetric, it's diagonalizable, and the eigenstates would be the eigenvectors of this matrix.

The eigenvalues of such a matrix can be found by solving det(A - λI)=0.

So the characteristic equation is:

| -λ      (hbar/2) |
|(hbar/2) -λ | = 0

Which is λ² - ( (hbar/2)^2 ) = 0.

So λ² = (hbar²/4 ), which gives λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, no, because the determinant is (λ)^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for each eigenvalue can be found. For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I ) |v> =0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2 , hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

Which gives the equation (-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the equations would give v1 = -v2, so eigenvectors proportional to (1,-1).

We can normalize these. The first eigenvector (for +hbar/2) is (1,1)/sqrt(2), and the second is (1,-1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

These are the eigenstates of the operator A, with eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Now, the next step is to express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

So, let's compute the expansion of |alpha> in the basis of |+> and |->.

First, let's write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

We can compute c_+ and c_- by projecting |alpha> onto |+> and |->.

Compute c_+ = < + | alpha >.

Similarly, c_- = < - | alpha >.

Let me compute c_+ first.

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2))( <up| + <down| ) |alpha>.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ].

Compute <up|alpha> and <down|alpha>.

From |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>,

<up|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7),

<down|alpha> = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

Combine the terms:

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

(1 + 2) + (i -i) → 3 + 0i.

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) * 3

= 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute c_-.

c_- = < - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2))( <up| - <down| ) |alpha>,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up|alpha> - <down|alpha> ]

So,

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Simplify inside:

(1-2) + (i +i) → (-1) + (2i).

So,

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) ] / ( sqrt(14) )

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

(3)^2 / (14) ) → 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

And |c_-|²:

| (-1 + 2i) |² /14 → [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, wait, 9/14 ≈ 0.64286, and 5/14≈ 0.35714.

So probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close.

But let's double-check.

Compute |c_-|²:

(-1 + 2i) → modulus squared is (1 +4) =5 → 5/14 ≈0.357, which is 0.357, so 0.357 is approximately 0.36 (when rounded to two decimal places).

But looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64 and 0.36.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the c_+ and c_-.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation of c_+ and c_-.

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = [3 + 0i]/sqrt(14) → 3/sqrt(14).

So |c_+|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = [ (1-2) + (i + i) ] / sqrt(14) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So modulus squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So yes, the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, which is very close.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3 hbar/sqrt(7).

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7).

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar/sqrt(7).

Hmm, so option A is the only one that matches the probabilities. But wait, I need to compute the average value of the operator to see which option is correct.

The expectation value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in its eigenbasis, the expectation value is |c_+|² * (hbar/2) + |c_-|² * (-hbar/2).

So,

< A > = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9/14 -5/14 ] (hbar/2) ) = (4/14) (hbar/2) ) = (2/7) (hbar/2) ) → hbar/(7).

Wait, that's hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7, which matches option A's third part.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check the average value calculation.

Another way: compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in the standard basis, |alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So,

A |alpha> = [ (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) , (hbar/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate of the first component multiplied by the first component of A|alpha>, plus the conjugate of the second component multiplied by the second component of A|alpha>.

Wait, no, more accurately:

<alpha| A |alpha> = ( ( (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ) ) * A |alpha> )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = ( (0)( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (hbar/2)( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ), (hbar/2)( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + 0*( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) )

So,

A |alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is:

( ( (1-i)/sqrt(7) ), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ) multiplied by the above vector.

Which is:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7 )

Factor out (hbar/2) and 1/(7):

= (hbar/2) [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] /7.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1(-i) -i(2) +i^2 → 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) + (-3i) → 1-3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 → 2 +2i +i -1 → (2-1) + (3i) → 1 +3i.

Adding these two terms together: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2 +0i.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * 2 /7 → (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) → hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier calculation. So the average is hbar/7.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357), and the average is hbar/7. So option A.

Wait, but looking at option A, the average is hbar/7, which matches. So the correct answer must be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 \), where \( a = 1+i \) and \( b = 2-i \). 

- \( |a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 + 1 = 2 \),
- \( |b|^2 = (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 1 = 5 \),
- Total normalization factor: \( \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7} \).

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenbasis of \( A \). The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are computed as:

\[
c_+ = \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
