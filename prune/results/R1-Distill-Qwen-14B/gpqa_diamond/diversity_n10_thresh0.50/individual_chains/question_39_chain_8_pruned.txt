Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, we've got a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3, not outside that range.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A to D, with some numerical values. So I need to find 'a' such that the wave function satisfies the normalization condition because the probability of finding the particle is 1 within that region.

Wait, normalization condition. Right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. But since the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, the integral is from 1 to 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, that's a complex function. So the square of the absolute value would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Because |ψ|^2 = (Reψ)^2 + (Imψ)^2.

So let's write ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - (0.5)i.

Then |ψ|^2 is [a² / (1 + x)] + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is
