Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> describing an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Hmm, right, so these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The first part asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. So let's think about this matrix.

Wait, for a two-level system, the operator's matrix would be 2x2. So if iâ‰ j, A_ij is hbar/2, else 0. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0     ]

Hmm, that's a spin operator but not the standard Sz. Wait, because the standard Sz would have diagonal elements. But this operator A has off-diagonal elements and zero diagonal. So it's like a sigma_x kind of operator multiplied by something, perhaps.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply by hbar/2, then A would be (hbar/2) sigma_x. Because sigma matrices are 2x2, so this A looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so for A, the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of operator A. So the operator A is proportional to sigma_x, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, the spin states along the x-axis.

So the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis, but we need to express it in the x-basis to find the probabilities.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors of A and express |alpha> in terms of those eigenvectors. Then the coefficients will give the probabilities.

So let me find the eigenvectors of A. Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Right, because sigma_x |+x> = +|+x>, and same for the other.

So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, if I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.
