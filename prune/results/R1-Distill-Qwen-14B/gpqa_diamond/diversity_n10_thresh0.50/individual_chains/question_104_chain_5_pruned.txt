Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let's see what the problem says.

So, we have two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and the problem gives the wavelength shift for each.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The star moves in a small orbit around the system's center of mass. The RV signal depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, among other factors.

Wait, the formula I think is related to the semi-amplitude of the RV signal. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the orbital distance. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

I recall that K is proportional to (M_planet * sin(i)) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1/(P))^(1/3). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing some terms here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / (4 * pi^2 * (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3)) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ) * something else. Hmm, maybe I should think of the formula in a different way.

Wait, let me get this straight. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(3/2) )) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune and stars are solar mass, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p â‰ˆ M_*, which is the mass
