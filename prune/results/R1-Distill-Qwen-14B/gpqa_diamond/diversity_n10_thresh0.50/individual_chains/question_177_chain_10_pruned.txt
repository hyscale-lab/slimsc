Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

First, let's jot down the given information. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting. The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength. And the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity might not directly affect this, but I'll think about it later.

The astronomers assumed the stars radiate as black bodies, so I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law here. The luminosity of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the peak wavelength is the same for both stars. I remember Wien's Law, which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719 ×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, right, same peak wavelength implies same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Because if the stars have the same peak wavelength, then according to Wien's Law, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2. So that's a key point.

So now, let's think about the luminosities. L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴. Since T1=T2, the ratio L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²). Because R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 =1.5. So (R1^2)/(R2^2) = (1.5)^2 = 2
