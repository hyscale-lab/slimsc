Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) times molarity. So for the acetic acid, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Molarity is 0.05 M, so moles = 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles.

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles divided by new volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) would be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let me figure out how much NaOH is used.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH is a strong base, each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. So the number of moles of NaOH added is 0.00025.

But wait, the NaOH's concentration is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH added is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. But maybe I don't need the volume for this part.

After adding 25% of the required NaOH, the solution will be a buffer solution. Because some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, and log(1e-5) is -5. So pKa is approximately 4.737 (since 1.85 is 10^0.267). Wait, precise calculation: 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. So pKa = 4.737.

Now, for the buffer solution. Moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001. 25% has reacted, so moles of HA (acetic acid) remaining are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of A^- (acetate) formed are 0.00025.

But wait, the total volume after adding NaOH is important. The initial solution was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations: [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let me calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425. Hmm, 0.00075 is 7.5e-4, divided by 0.0425 is approximately 0.017647 M.

[A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M.

Now, plug into Henderson
