Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h over 4π. And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So the matrix S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σx, σy, σz. And the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which matches the S matrix here. Oh, so S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay is (h/4π) times sigma y.

The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the options aren't directly about the eigenvalues; they're about statements regarding the process or properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. So I need to go through the calculations and see which statements are correct.

First, let's think about the general approach. For a 2x2 matrix, finding eigenvalues involves solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

Alternatively, since Ay is a scalar multiple of S (which is sigma y), and since sigma y is a Pauli matrix, I can recall the properties of Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when I multiply by a constant, the eigenvalues will just be scaled accordingly.

Let me compute Ay. Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma y.

Since sigma y has eigenvalues 1 and -1, the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1), so a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ± h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the eigenvalues of Ay would be real numbers. Hmm. Because sigma y is Hermitian, so Ay, being a real multiple of a Hermitian matrix, is also Hermitian. So its eigenvalues should be real. So any option suggesting imaginary parts is incorrect.

So options A and B are talking about the eigenvalues having both real and imaginary parts, which can't be correct. Because the operator Ay is Hermitian (since S is Hermitian, because S^\dagger = S; wait, S is sigma y, which is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and its conjugate transpose would be [[0,i],[-i,0]], which is not the same as S. Wait, actually, no—sigma y is Hermitian. Because for a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose.

Wait, let's calculate S^dagger. The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], right? Because the (1,2
