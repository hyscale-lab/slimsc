Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand the criteria for each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, brighter than 17, meaning apparent V magnitude less than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So for a star to be detected, its apparent V magnitude must be <= 17 for ESPRESSO? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I think the brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent V magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitude up to 17. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, so if the apparent magnitude is brighter (lower), then it's detectable. So ESPRESSO observes stars with apparent V <=17, because brighter than 17 is the same as magnitude less than 17.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Apparent magnitude is how bright the star appears from Earth. The magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are
