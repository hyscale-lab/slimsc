Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars and their luminosities. Hmm, I need to figure out the factor by which Star_1 is more luminous than Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the masses are in the same ratio, so M1 = 1.5 * M2. But wait, the question is about luminosities, which I remember depends on radius and temperature, not mass directly. Oh, right, but mass might be relevant if it affects the temperature somehow, but maybe I can ignore that for now since the problem says they radiate as black bodies.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Black body radiation peaks at wavelength λ_max, which according to Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T were different, λ_max would change. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity depends on the square of their radii.

Wait, wait! But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that come into play? Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, right? So if a star is moving towards us (or away), the observed wavelength shifts. But in this problem, the brightest wavelengths are the same for both, which we already accounted for by setting their temperatures equal. Or is there another effect here?

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers calculated the luminosities using the black body radiation, so perhaps the radial velocities are a red herring. Or perhaps they affect the observed flux, which might influence the calculated luminosity. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think more carefully.

The luminosity is an intrinsic property of the star, while
