Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. 

The given data is the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, wait. Wait, the interatomic distance—does that mean the lattice parameter 'a' is 10? Or is it something else? Oh, wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the lattice parameters are the same, right? So a = b = c, and all angles are the same as well, which is 30 degrees each here.

So the formula I remember for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal formula. The formula is d = 1/(sqrt((h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2(hk cosβ/(a^2)) + ... wait, I think the general formula involves cosines of the angles between the axes. Oh right, the formula for d in a rhombohedral system is more specific since all the angles are equal and a, b, c are equal.

Wait, the general formula for d_hkl in a crystal is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cosγ) - 2(hl cosβ) - 2(kl cosα) )) ). But in a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c, and α = β = γ, this simplifies. 

So substituting, because a = b = c = a, and all angles are the same. So the expression becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosγ - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosα )

Since all angles are γ, β, alpha are 30 degrees, and we have h, k, l as 1,1,1 for the (111) plane.

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, and angles 30 degrees.

First, compute each term:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
