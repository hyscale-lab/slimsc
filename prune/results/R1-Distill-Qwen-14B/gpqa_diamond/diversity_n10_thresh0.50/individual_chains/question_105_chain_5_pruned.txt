Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out. 

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of it (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area of the spots relative to the total surface area of the star. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They say that because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star's brightness over time (like from photometry), we'll see periodic variations because the star is rotating. These variations might mimic the signal of an exoplanet transiting the star. 

The question is asking: if the star wasn't spotted, what size exoplanet (in terms of radius relative to the star) would produce the same amplitude in the light curve? So essentially, comparing the brightness dip caused by planet transit versus the brightness variation due to these spots.

Hmm, okay, I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. 

First, I should think about how each of these situations affects the star's brightness as seen from Earth. For a planet transiting a star, the dip in brightness is the area of the planet's disk compared to the star's disk. The formula is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, what's happening with the star's spots? The spots are cooler, so when they are facing towards us (as the star rotates), the total brightness we receive decreases. Since it's one hemisphere covered, but the spots are only 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20%—I think that means that the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Because the star's surface area is 4πR², the spots take up 0.20 times that. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, does that mean the entire hemisphere is spotted? Well, the filling factor is 20%, so perhaps the total area of spots is 20% of the star's surface. 

Let me clarify: If the spots cover one hemisphere, that's half the surface. But the filling factor is 20%, so the actual area covered by spots is 0.20 * 4πR². So the area of the spots is 0.20 * total surface area.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the area covered by spots on the hemisphere that's spotty. So if one hemisphere is spotty and the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere, then the total area of spots is 0.20 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Because a hemisphere is half the surface area: 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR², so the spot coverage is 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1 or 1
