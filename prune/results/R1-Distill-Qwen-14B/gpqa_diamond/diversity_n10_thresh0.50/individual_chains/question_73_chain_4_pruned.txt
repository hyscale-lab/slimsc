Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through this.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Starting with the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Wait, let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7. Let's compute that. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428... so 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Hmm, so looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I should calculate the energy for each and sum them. The energy E for each is gamma multiplied by m c squared. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct total energy should be about 5.96 mc². Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but I should double-check the relative speed calculation. When both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So I did (0.6c - 0.5c) over (1 - (0.3c²)/c²). So 0.1c / (0.7) is indeed 1/7 c, which is approximately 0.1428c. So 0.14c is correct, as in options C and D.

Thus, the options are C and D for the velocity part. Since C has the correct energy, the
