Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has different capabilities when it comes to the brightness of the stars they can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, when the question says "brighter than 17 mag", does that mean apparent magnitude less than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star has an apparent magnitude of 17, it's dimmer than a star with 16. So, for ESPRESSO, it can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, which would be stars with V mag less than or equal to 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag less than or equal to 16.

Wait, but the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, which is V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. Because, for example, a star that is brighter (lower magnitude) than 17 is observable by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 by HIRES.

So, the star must be observable by both, which means that its apparent magnitude must be <=16, because HIRES can only go up to 16. Because, wait, wait. Let me think. If a star's apparent magnitude is 17, ESPRESSO can see it (since it's brighter than 17, so 17 is the limit). But HIRES can only go up to 16. So a star with an apparent magnitude of 17 is too dim for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V magnitude <=16 to be detected by both.

Wait, no, because
