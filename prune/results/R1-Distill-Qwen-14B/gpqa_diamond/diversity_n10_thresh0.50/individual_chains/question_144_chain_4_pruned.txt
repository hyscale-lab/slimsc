Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But how do I calculate that?

I think the formula for the mean decay distance involves the particle's lifetime (τ) and its velocity (βc). The formula should be something like L = cτβ. Right, because L is the distance, which is velocity multiplied by time. So I need to find τ first.

The lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ. The uncertainty principle tells us that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, but in particle physics, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE. So τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Wait, but I should double-check the exact relation. Oh right, the relation is Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, no. Wait, Γ is the decay width, which is the total width, and Γ = ħ / τ. So τ equals ħ divided by Γ. But I need to make sure about the units here.

So, let's note down the constants. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because ħ is 1.0545718 ×10^-34 J·s, but converting to GeV units, I think it's around 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ_X. Substituting the numbers, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) → let's compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, I think the decay width is actually Γ = ħ / τ, so τ is ħ/(Γ). Correct.

Now, I need to find the velocity β. To find β, I should use the energy and mass of the meson. Beta is v/c, so β = v/c.

The energy of the particle is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c
