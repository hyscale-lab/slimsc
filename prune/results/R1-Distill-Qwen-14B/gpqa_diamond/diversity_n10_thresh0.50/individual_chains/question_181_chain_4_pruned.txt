Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm. Let me think. The question is about the Sun's neutrino flux in two different energy bands after the pp-III branch reactions stop. 

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that in the Sun's core, there are several proton-proton (pp) reactions. The main ones are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-I reaction produces helium-4 and positrons, pp-II involves more steps, maybe with higher energy? Or wait, pp-III is a higher-energy branch, maybe involving more protons and producing higher-energy neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for the neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the decay of positrons in the pp reactions. The specific reaction is when a positron (Î²+) is captured by a neutron, emitting a neutrino. So each of these reactions would produce neutrinos with specific energy ranges.

The pp-III branch probably produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Oh, because the pp-III reactions might involve higher temperatures or more energetic particles. So if pp-III stops, then the flux of higher-energy neutrinos (like in the 800-900 keV band) would drop, but the lower bands might be unaffected or less affected.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio of two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower energy, band 2 higher.

If pp-III is responsible for producing neutrinos in the higher energy bands, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 more than band 1. So the flux in band 1 would be similar, but band 2 would drop. So the ratio (band1 / band2) would increase because band2 is lower.

What's the typical distribution of solar neutrino energies? I think most of them are in the lower keV range. The pp-I and pp-II reactions produce lower-energy neutrinos, while pp-III produces more energetic ones. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos would be fewer.

So if the flux in band 2 (800-900) is mainly from pp-III, and band 1 is from other sources (like pp-I and II), then without pp-III, band2 flux drops. So the ratio band1/band2 would be higher than before. 

Wait, but what was the original ratio? Without the pp-III stopping, what's the flux in these bands? Let me think. The main solar neutrinos come from the dominant pp-I reaction, which emits lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are minor but contribute to higher energies. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (band2) would drop, but band1 (lower energy) would be mostly from pp-I and pp-II, which are still active.

So the flux in band2 would decrease, while band1 remains roughly the same. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be higher. 

If the pp-III was contributing a significant fraction to band2, then without it, band2's flux would drop a
