Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think Li usually has 3 protons, so with 3 neutrons, it must be Li-6, right? Because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy of the collider. So, I remember that in particle accelerators, the total energy is related to the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or is it just the kinetic energy? No, wait. When you accelerate particles to relativistic speeds, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But sometimes, in accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this.

Wait, the question says "what is the energy of the RHIC". I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy per beam is usually given as the kinetic energy. Or wait, noâ€”sometimes, especially in high-energy physics, the energy referred to is the total energy, which includes both rest mass and kinetic. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, the problem gives options in GeV, which is giga-electron volts. So I need to compute the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96
