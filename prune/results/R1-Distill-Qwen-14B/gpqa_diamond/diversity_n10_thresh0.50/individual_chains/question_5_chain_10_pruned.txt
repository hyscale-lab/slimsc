Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, okay.

So, first, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the components like P_x, P_y, P_z are represented by 2x2 matrices. The problem gives each of these components multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down what each component matrix looks like.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So, that's (ħ/2)(σ_x), where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2)(σ_y), and P_z is (ħ/2)(σ_z).

Wait, yeah, the Pauli matrices. So σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Right.

The operator P is the vector operator, so it's P = P_x x, P_y y, P_z z. But the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. That means it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), or maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, right? Because in the x-z plane, the direction lies along, say, the x and z axes. So, if the direction is in x-z, then the angle φ is zero or π, but wait, since it's arbitrary, maybe the components are (n_x, 0, n_z) with n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Wait, the operator P is along direction n, so the operator in question would be P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator becomes P = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

So, the operator we're dealing with is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the problem says to find the eigenvector of the operator P (that is, along n) corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, we need to find the eigenvector of (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the spin operator. Since for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of S·n are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. The eigenvalue for spin-up would be ħ/2.

So, in this case, the eigenvector we are looking for is the spin-up state along the direction n
