Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the specific question again?

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And it's asking about the geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

I think I need to figure out where this density matrix lies in the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Each qubit can be represented as a point on a unit sphere.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = ½ (|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, calculating this out, each term is a projector. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (2,2). Adding them together, each adds 0.5 when multiplied by ½. So ρ becomes a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 in (1,1) and (2,2), and 0 elsewhere.

I think the density matrix for a pure state |ψ> is |ψ><ψ|. For example, |0> is (1,0), so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. But ρ here is a mixture, a completely mixed state. Oh wait, because
