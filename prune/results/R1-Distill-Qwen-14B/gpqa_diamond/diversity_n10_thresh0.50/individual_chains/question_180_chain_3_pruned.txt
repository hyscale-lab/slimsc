Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is about electric potential energy since we're dealing with charges and their arrangement. Since the system is isolated, energy considerations would involve potential energy.

Wait, the system consists of 13 charges. Twelve are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the charge at P is fixed, and the others are arranged in a sphere 2 meters away. But wait, are the 12 charges all at the same distance from P? Oh, yes, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P.

So the setup is a central charge, and 12 others arranged symmetrically at a distance of 2 meters from it. But since the system is isolated, the potential energy would be due to the interactions between all these charges.

Wait, but each charge is 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is 2 * 1.6e
