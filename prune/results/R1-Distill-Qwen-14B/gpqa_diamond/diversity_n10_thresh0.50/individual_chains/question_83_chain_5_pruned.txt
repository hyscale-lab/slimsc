Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is usually in the basic range because the salt formed (in this case, sodium acetate) will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions.

But let's break it down.

First, I think I need to calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Initially, it's 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Since we're adding 20 cm³ of water, the new concentration is moles divided by total volume: 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the first step is to find out the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question also asks about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³, right? Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So now, the two points we need are: 

1. When 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added (25% titration).
2. When 10 cm³ (equivalence point) of NaOH has been added.

Let's handle each case one by one.

Firstly, the 25% titration point (2.5 cm³ NaOH added).

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). Let's find the concentrations.

The initial diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. The volume is 40 cm³ (20 +20). When we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025 mol, and moles of CH3COO^- will increase by the same amount.

Original moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol. So after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now has both the weak acid and its conjugate base. This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

First, pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). Let me compute that. Let's see: 1.85e-5 is the Ka. So log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pKa is approximately 4.73.

Now, the concentrations of A- and HA. The total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

[HA] = moles / volume = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is approx -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Rounded to two decimal places, that's about 4.25. Let's say approximately 4.26? Hmm, looking at the options, option A starts with 4.26. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, let
