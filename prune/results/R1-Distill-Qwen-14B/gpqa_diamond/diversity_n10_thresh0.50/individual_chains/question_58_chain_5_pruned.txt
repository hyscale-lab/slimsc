Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which don't make physical sense. Regularization helps to make these infinities manageable so we can calculate finite results after renormalization.

So, each option: let's think about each theory.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I've heard that string theories are supposed to be finite or at least have fewer divergences than other quantum field theories. Regularization isn't needed as much because the theory doesn't have the same kinds of divergences. Or wait, do they still use it? I think in string theory, the calculations often don't require the same kind of divergent regularization because the underlying structure is different. Strings have higher-dimensional aspects, so maybe they avoid some of the problems that other QFTs face.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong force. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with asymptotic freedom. Because of that, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling becomes weak. But wait, in QCD, calculations often lead to things like Landau poles or other divergences. I think QCD does require regularization. Also, because it's a non-abelian theory, things like confinement and the existence of things like instantons might complicate things, so they probably use regularization methods.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established abelian gauge theory. QED does have issues with divergences. For example, the electron self-energy and the vacuum polarization both lead to divergent integrals. These require regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or using Pauli-Villars regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization because of these divergences. But wait, after regularization and renormalization, QED works perfectly and gives accurate predictions.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version. So, in classical ED, do we have any issues that
