Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, what's a resonance in this context? Oh right, a resonance in particle physics is a particle with a very short lifetime, which means it can't be observed directly and instead decays almost immediately. 

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, ranging from around 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

So, how do I find the mean decay distance? I think it's related to the lifetime of the particle. The mean lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For a particle, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), and the mean lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time (Δt). So I can write τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should double-check that. Oh right, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So rearranging, τ = ħ / Γ. Makes sense.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance (L) would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ. But I need to find the speed. How?

The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The mass of the meson is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the kinetic energy and then the speed. Wait, but wait, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. The rest energy is m_X c². But since we're working in GeV, and c is approximately 1 in these units (because E = mc² and when E is in GeV and m in GeV/c², c is 1), I can approximate E ≈ gamma * m, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So gamma = E / (m c²). Since in natural units (GeV, GeV/c², etc.), c is 1
