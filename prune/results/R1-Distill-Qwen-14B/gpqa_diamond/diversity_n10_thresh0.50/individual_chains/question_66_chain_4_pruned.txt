Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives four options: 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, 4. CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these, and I need to choose which combination must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, what's SMEFT again? I remember it's a framework where you take the Standard Model and add higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the Standard Model physics. These operators must respect certain symmetries.

So, starting with the symmetries. Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because in any relativistic theory, Lorentz symmetry is fundamental. Operators in SMEFT would have to respect that, right? So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (momentum conservation and such). Since SMEFT is a effective field theory, I think it's based on local symmetries. Effective theories are usually Lorentz invariant, which implies Poincare invariance as well. Wait, but isn't Poincare symmetry more about the combination of Lorentz and translations? So if operators respect Lorentz symmetry, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or is Poincare a separate symmetry that must be enforced?

Wait, I'm getting confused. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. That would mean that Lorentz symmetry is definitely respected. Does that imply Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations (like momentum conservation), which in EFT is handled by the fact that the theory is translationally invariant. So operators are local, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. Hmm, so both Lorentz and Poincare are required. So options which include both 1 and 2 are possible.

What about CP and CPT symmetries? Now, in the Standard Model, the SM is CPT symmetric. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I'm not so sure. Because SMEFT allows for higher-dimension operators that can break CP. For example, some operators in the SMEFT basis can violate CP, which is why people look for CP violation in SMEFT for things like new physics beyond the SM. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect
