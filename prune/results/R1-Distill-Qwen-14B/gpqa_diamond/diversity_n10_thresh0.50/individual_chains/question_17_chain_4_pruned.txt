Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given K value is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, each with different concentrations.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, calcium is forming a complex with EDTA. The stoichiometric complex implies a 1:1 ratio between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because the EDTA is binding to Ca²+, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be much lower than the concentration of the complex.

I think the key here is the formation constant, K. K for the complex formation is given as 5x10^10. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formula I remember is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

Since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-]. Let me denote the concentration of free calcium ions as [Ca²+] = x, and the concentration of free EDTA^4- as y.

Wait, but because EDTA is a polydentate ligand, I think that under the assumption of ideal conditions and that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, the concentration of EDTA^4- and Ca²+ would relate in a certain way. Let me think about the total concentration.

The total concentration of EDTA in solution would be the sum of the free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. But in this case, since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming that all the EDTA is in the complex form (since the pH is ideal, maybe the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available), the total EDTA is 0.02 M.

Wait no, wait. The complex is Ca
