Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx in arcseconds equals 1 over distance in parsecs. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is larger, the star is closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what way? Oh, wait, I think it refers to the density of stars being uniform in space. So, the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. But since we're observing from Earth, the way they appear in the sky depends on their distance.

So the problem is about counting the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I have a small range of parallax, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Let's think about the distribution. If the stars are uniformly distributed, then the number density n is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume.

But wait, how does parallax relate to distance? Parallax plx is approximately 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So as d increases, plx decreases.

Now, for a star at distance d, the volume of space around it would be a sphere of radius d. But when considering a range of distances, say from d to d+Î”d,
