Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me think this through step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile like NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Oh wait, in the presence of a base, maybe it's a substitution. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a cyclic ketone? No, butan-2-one is a straight chain ketone. So the reaction is probably a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be: the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an oxime intermediate. Oh wait, NaCN might not be the right reagent for that. Or wait, maybe it's a more straightforward addition. Alternatively, could it be a substitution?

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yes, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + nitrile in H+ to form a cyanohydrin. So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2
