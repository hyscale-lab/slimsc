Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, relativistic means their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so I guess I need to use special relativity principles here.

The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A, B, C, D with different values for the relative speed and total energy.

First, I need to think about how to find the relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember that you can't just subtract their speeds because that would give something faster than light, which isn't allowed. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different.

The formula for relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u1 and u2 relative to a rest frame (and assuming they're moving in the same direction) is u' = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1*u2)/c²). Wait, but wait—no, I think I might have that reversed. Because if u1 is moving faster than u2, then the relative speed should be u1 - u2 divided by that factor. So let me get it right.

Wait, no. The formula for the speed of an object as observed from another frame moving at velocity v is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case
