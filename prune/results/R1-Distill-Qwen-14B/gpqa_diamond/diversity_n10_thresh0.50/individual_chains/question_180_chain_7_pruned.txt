Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. 

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at the same distance from P, which is 2 meters. 

I think the question is about finding the electric potential energy of the system. Because when you have multiple charges in a system, the potential energy depends on their arrangement. Since all the 12 charges are at the same distance from the fixed charge, maybe they're arranged symmetrically around it. Like, maybe they're equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 meters centered at P.

Wait, but how does that affect the potential energy? Oh right, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the charges are identical and repel each other, the system's energy will be the sum of the potentials due to each charge.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So when I bring each of the 1
