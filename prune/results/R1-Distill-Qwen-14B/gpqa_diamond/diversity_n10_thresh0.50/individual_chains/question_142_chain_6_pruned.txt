Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are A to D with different r coordinates.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out properly. So, |0> is the basis vector for the ground state, and |1> is the excited state. Each is multiplied by their respective outer products and added together, then multiplied by 1/2.

I remember that a density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and would be a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But here, ρ is a mixture of two projectors: |0> and |1>, each with a coefficient of 1/2. So this must be a mixed state.

In terms of qubit space, a qubit is a two-level system, so it can be represented as a vector in a 2D space. But wait, the density matrix is 2x2, so it's in the space of 2x2 matrices. However, the question is about its geometrical position—maybe in the Bloch sphere representation?

Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. For a pure state |θ, φ>, the Bloch vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), where θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively. But this is for pure states. What about mixed states?

I think for mixed states, especially when they're a completely mixed state, like this ρ might be. Because ρ here is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that: each of the basis projectors contributes ½, so when you add them, you get a diagonal matrix with ½ on the diagonal. So ρ is [[½, 0], [0, ½]]. I remember that this matrix is the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Now, how does this correspond to the Bloch sphere? Well, the pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and the completely mixed state is at the center. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, the center would be the point (0,0,0). So the density matrix ρ being maximally mixed would correspond to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is a point in three-dimensional space.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which matches that. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Are there other representations where the point isn't (0,0,0)? Like, perhaps when considering the vector representation in terms of the density matrix's parameters. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as (I + r · σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So for ρ = (I)/2, which is exactly the case here, the r vector would be zero because there's no contribution from the Pauli terms.
