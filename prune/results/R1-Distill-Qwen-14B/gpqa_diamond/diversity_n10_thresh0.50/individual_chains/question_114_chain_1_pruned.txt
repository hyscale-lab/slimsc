Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is another reaction where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given are A to D, each pairing reagents A and B. I need to choose the correct pair.

Let me break this down. Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. When ketones react with NaCN, I remember that under certain conditions, they can undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically don't react with HCN in the same way as aldehydes because they're less reactive. Oh wait, waitâ€”maybe it's the formation of cyanohydrin here.

Cyanohydrin formation involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the
