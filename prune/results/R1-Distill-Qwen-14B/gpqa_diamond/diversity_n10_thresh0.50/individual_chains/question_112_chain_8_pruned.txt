Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Then, I also need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because it's given as proportional, I should find the normalization constant.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, calculate the inner product:

(1-i) (1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)
Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is 1 if same, 0 otherwise.

So <alpha|alpha> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i).

Calculating each term:

(1-i)(1+i) = 1*(1) + 1*(i) -i*(1) -i*(i) = 1 + i -i -i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 +0 +1 = 2.

Similarly, (2+i)(2-i) is 2² - (i)² = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, wait. What are the basis states here? Since the state is in spin space, the operator is acting on spin states. The z-projection has |up> and |down> as eigenstates. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix.

So let me write out the matrix for A. Since Aij is ħ/2 for i≠j and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

So the matrix is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

Wait, but wait, sometimes in quantum mechanics, the basis order matters. So in this case, the first basis is |up>, second is |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of this matrix. So perhaps the eigenstates are different from |up> and |down>. So the operator A is given, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues when measuring this operator on |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the measurement is in the eigenbasis
