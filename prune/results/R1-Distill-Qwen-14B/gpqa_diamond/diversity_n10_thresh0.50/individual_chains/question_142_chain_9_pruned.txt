Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. But wait, I need to find its position in the qubits space. Oh right, the Bloch sphere representation! For a single qubit, the density matrix can be mapped onto a point on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), right? Each qubit state can be represented as a vector on this sphere. The pure states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are at the poles. So |0⟩ is at (0,0,1) and |1⟩ is at (0,0,-1). But this density matrix is a mixture of these two.

Let me think about how to represent this. The given density matrix is ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. That looks like a completely mixed state because it's an equal mixture of the two basis states. So it's a statistical mixture, not a pure state. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state for a qubit is the maximally mixed state, which should be at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the maximally mixed state is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Oh wait, because ρ here is exactly (I/2). So that would correspond to the point (0,0,0) because it's the origin.

Wait, but what's the general way to convert a density matrix into Bloch vector coordinates? I think the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector (x,y,z) and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if I write ρ as (I + r·σ)/2, then comparing to the given ρ which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2 = I/2. That means that the (I + r·σ)/2 equals I/2
