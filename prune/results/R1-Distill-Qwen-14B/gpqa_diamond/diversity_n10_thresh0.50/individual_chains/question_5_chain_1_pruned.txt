Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the eigenvector of an operator along a certain direction, right? Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is an arbitrary unit vector n lying in the x-z plane. Oh wait, so n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Or wait, sometimes it's cosθ and sinθ, depending on the convention. I'll keep that in mind.

The components of the operator P are given. For each component Px, Py, Pz, they are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Py is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Pz is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

So the operator P is a vector operator, and we need to find its eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along the direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator in the direction of n is P · n, right? So P · n = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

So the eigenvector equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So we have to find the eigenvectors of the matrix (n_x Px + n_z Pz), and specifically the one with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Let me denote n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ? Or perhaps it's the other way around. Sometimes θ is the polar angle, so n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ. Yeah, that makes sense.
