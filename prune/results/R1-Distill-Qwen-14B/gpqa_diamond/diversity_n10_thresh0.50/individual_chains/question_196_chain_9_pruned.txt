Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says it's a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, so in the classical case, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0) is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which would be option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so things are different because of special relativity.

In special relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential. The total energy includes rest mass energy. So the oscillator's total energy E would be the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and kinetic energy. But wait, no, wait. Or maybe I'm thinking of it wrong. Because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ=1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, I think the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Let me try to model this.

At maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is momentarily at rest (the velocity is zero there). So the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

Wait no, wait. Oh no, wait a minute. In the classical case, the potential energy is maximum at x=A, so kinetic is zero. But in the relativistic case, is the potential energy still (1/2)kx²? Because Hooke's law is still F = -kx, so I think the potential energy is the same, so yes, at x=A, potential is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero. So the total energy E is (1
