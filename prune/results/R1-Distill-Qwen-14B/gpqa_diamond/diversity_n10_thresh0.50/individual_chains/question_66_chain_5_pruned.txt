Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. But what symmetries must all the operators respect?

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these. I think I need to figure out which of these must be respected by every operator in SMEFT.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, does that mean it's not allowed in SMEFT?

But wait, SMEFT is constructed to be a low-energy effective theory, so it should respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model already respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT's operators must preserve that. But what about Poincare? Poincare symmetry is more than just Lorentz; it includes momentum conservation via translations. Do the SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare?

Wait, maybe I should think about the form of the operators. SMEFT operators are classified by their dimension and the fields they involve. But all operators must be consistent with the Standard Model's gauge symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry. Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry, but I'm not sure if SMEFT operators necessarily respect Poincare. Because SMEFT itself is a Lore
