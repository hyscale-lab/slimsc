Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in different media and how motion affects it. Oh right, in a medium at rest, the speed is c/n, since the index of refraction n = c/v, where v is the speed in the medium. So when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I think I need to consider the relative motion of the glass and the light. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, that might influence how the observer measures the light's speed. But wait, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is a classical mechanics problem, right? Because if it were relativistic, the answer would be straightforward as c. But the options don't have c as an option, except for option B which is 1 (since c=1 in the problem). So that's confusing.

Wait, no, the question specifies that the glass is moving at a constant velocity. So maybe it's not considering relativistic effects, but using the Galilean transformation of velocities. Because in Galilean relativity, velocities add linearly.

So let's model this. The speed of light in the glass when the glass is at rest is v0 = c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, how does that affect the light's speed as seen by someone on the lab frame?

In the glass's frame, the light is moving at v0 = c/n towards the observer. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the lab would see the light's speed as v0 + v? Because the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, but wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating towards the observer as well. So if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n towards the observer, then in the lab frame, the speed would be (c/n) + v.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.
