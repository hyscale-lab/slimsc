Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember from my solid state chemistry class that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and Miller indices. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length of the unit cell. Oh wait, no, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, right? Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in a rhombohedral structure, maybe the lattice parameter 'a' is the same as the interatomic distance? Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says it's a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom. So interatomic distance 'd' is 10 A. So I think in this case, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstrom. Because in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner, so the edge length is the same as the interatomic distance.

So the crystal has parameters a = 10 A, and all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Right, because in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal and all the angles are equal. So we're dealing with a rhombohedral lattice with a = 10 A and angles 30 degrees each.

Now
