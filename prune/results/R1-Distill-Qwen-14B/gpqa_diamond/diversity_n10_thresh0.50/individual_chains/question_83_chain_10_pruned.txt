Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form acetate ions and water.

The problem says that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, the moles stay the same but the volume increases. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, making it 40 cm³ total.

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. Volume in liters, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. When diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Let me think about the equivalence point first.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles are 0.001, so the volume of NaOH needed is moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't about the volume, but the pH at equivalence.

At equivalence, the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base: NaCH3COO. This will hydrolyze in water. The acetate ion (CH3COO-) will react with water:
CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-
The Kb for this can be found using Kw/Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence is the same as the concentration of sodium acetate. Let's calculate that. The volume at equivalence is the total volume of acid plus NaOH added. Acid was 40 cm³, NaOH added 10 cm³, so 50 cm³ total (0.05 L). Moles of sodium acetate is 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So Kb is 5.405e-10, and concentration is 0.02 M. The hydroxide concentration can be found using the formula for Kb. Let's set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH-] is about 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.48. So pH is 14 - 5.48 = 8.52. Hmm, but wait, that's one of the options. Option A has 8.52 as the second value, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Step by step.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, 0.04 L → 0.025 M. At equivalence, moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH needed: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 mL. Total volume: 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Kb is correct, 5.405e-10. So the calculation of [OH-] is correct as 3.29e-6, leading to pH 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which is option A's second value.

Wait, but wait! I think I made a mistake. Because when you reach the equivalence point, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it's basic
