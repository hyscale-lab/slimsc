Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, right, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio, right? So each formula unit of the complex has one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion.

The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. I guess that means the pH is such that EDTA is in its deprotonated form, which is important because EDTA's ability to complex metals depends on its protonation state. But maybe I don't need to worry about that here because the question gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, K_f is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So K_f is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. And
