Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, their spectral lines would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So the condition should be ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but wait again. The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So for E1, τ is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 is ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, for E2, τ is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8).

Wait, but which energy is which. Oh, E1 is the energy of state 1, which has a lifetime of 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 would be ħ divided by that lifetime, same for E2.

Wait, so let me compute those values.

But wait, the units are a bit tricky. Let's think about the constants. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So hbar, ħ, is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So converting to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is 1.05457e-34 J·s / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE is approximately ħ / τ.

So for E1, τ1 =1e-9 s, so ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, τ2=1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, wait, let me check that calculation. 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 6.582e-7. And divided by 1e-8 is 6.582e-8.

So the energy uncertainties are roughly 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for E1 and E2 respectively.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference between E1 and E2 is |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the lines would overlap.

So the condition is |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So E2 - E1 (assuming E2 > E1) is the energy difference we're looking for.

So their difference should be greater than 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.238e-7 eV.

Wait, but let me compute that: 6.58e-7 is 6.58 * 1e-7, and 6.58e-8 is 0.658e-7. So adding them gives (6.58 + 0.658) * 1e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than about 7.238e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → way smaller than 7e-7, so no.

B)1e-11 → even smaller.

C)1e-4 → 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is larger than 7.238e-7.

Wait no, wait. Let me compute 7e-7 versus 1e-4. 7e-7 is 0.7e-6. 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 100 times larger. So 1e-4 is bigger than 7e-7.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the required 7e-7, so it would work.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The question is about the energy difference. So if the difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the sum of the uncertainties (about 7e-7 eV), then yes, they can be distinguished.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV.

What about option D: 1e-8 eV? That's about 1e-8, which is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties (7e-7) because 7e-7 is 700e-8. So 1e-8 is way too small. So D is worse.

So the correct option is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle states that:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty, \( \Delta t \) is the time uncertainty (or lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

For the two states:
- State 1 has a lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), so its energy uncertainty is:
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]
- State 2 has a lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), so its energy uncertainty is:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the energy uncertainties:
\[
|E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Adding the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be greater than approximately \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
