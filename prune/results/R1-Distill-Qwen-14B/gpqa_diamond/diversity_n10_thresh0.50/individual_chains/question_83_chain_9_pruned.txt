Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D, with different pH values.

First, I need to figure out what's happening in each part. Let's break it down.

Starting with the initial solution: acetic acid is being diluted. So the first step is to find the concentration after dilution. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes according to the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) and 20 cm³ of water is added, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). The initial concentration is 0.05 M. So the new concentration after dilution would be:

C2 = (C1 * V1) / V2
= (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L
= (0.001 mol) / 0.04 L
= 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base), producing sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na^+) and water.

The equivalence point comes when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles before titration.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: M = moles/volume(L)
M is 0.025 M, volume is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, initial solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M.

Moles initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

So the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are 0.001 mol.

Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 mole ratio. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001 mol.

But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed to reach equivalence is moles / concentration. So V = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. The question is: What is the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. Because sometimes in titration questions, "percent titration" refers to the fraction of the equivalence volume added.

So the equivalence volume is 10 cm³; 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.
