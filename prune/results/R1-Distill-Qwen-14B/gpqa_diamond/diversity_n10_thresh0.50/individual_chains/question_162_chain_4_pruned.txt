Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions, maybe polar coordinates? Because dx² + dy² is like the standard Euclidean metric.

Wait, but the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, right! So the metric has a conformal factor. Conformal metrics usually scale the Euclidean metric by some function. So this is a 2D metric, so it's probably describing some kind of surface.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to the tractricoid, which is the surface of constant negative curvature. But in this case, maybe it's a different kind of pseudosphere, or perhaps the metric given describes such a surface.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, but perhaps it's more useful to switch to polar coordinates. Let me see: if I let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, then x² + y² = r². So the denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the metric in polar coordinates would be ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Interesting. Now, for a surface of revolution, this might describe a surface with a specific kind of curvature.

Wait, in 2D, the metric can be written as ds² = g(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), where g(r) is some function. The area element is then sqrt(g) dr dθ. Wait, no, more accurately, the area element in polar coordinates is sqrt(det(g)) dr dθ. For a diagonal metric like this, the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2. Since g_rθ is zero, the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ.

So in this case, g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is [32/(4 - r²)] * r². So the determinant would be [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but for the area element, it's
