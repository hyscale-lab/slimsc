Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh right, the excitation level probably relates to the distribution of atoms in different energy levels, which is governed by the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation connects the relative populations of energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and the excitation is twice as much for star_1 as star_2. So I think that means the ratio of the populations is 2. Let's see, suppose the excited state is level i and the ground state is j. Then n_i/n_j for star 1 is 2 times that for star 2. Or wait, maybe the question is saying that the excitation (n_i) in star 1 is twice that in star 2 when considering the same energy difference. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited.
