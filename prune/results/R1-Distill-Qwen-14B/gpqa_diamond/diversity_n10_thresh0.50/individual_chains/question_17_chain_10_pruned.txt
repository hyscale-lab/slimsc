Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are ideal pH, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, what do I remember about this? I think this has to do with complex ions and their dissociation. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. When it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4-.

The formula they use for such dissociation is K = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY²-]. Since K is given as 5e10, which is a big number, the complex doesn't break down much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions ([Ca²+]) will be very low.

Wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaY²-] as approximately 0.02 M because the dissociation is minimal. So, the concentrations of the products, [Ca²+] and [Y^4-], should be equal because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x. 

Then, the K expression becomes:
K = (x)(x) / [CaY²-] = x² / 0.02

But wait, when K is very large, the approximation that [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 is valid because the dissociation is minimal. So, x² = K * [CaY²-] = (5e10)(0.02) 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is K = (x^2) / (0.02 - x). But because K is so large, x will be much smaller
