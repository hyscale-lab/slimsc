Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that reaction usually involves the substitution of a functional group, maybe something like a hydrolysis or maybe an elimination. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, or maybe for dehydrohalogenation? Hmm, not sure. Let me think. Oh, wait, when you have something like an ester reacting with HI and red phosphorus, it might be a hydrolysis. Or wait, red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction, but that's for ketones to alkanes. But Clemmensen uses HCl and red phosphorus. Wait, no, wait—maybe this is a different reaction. Oh, wait, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. Or perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an ester to carboxylic acid. Let me think again.

The problem gives me IR and NMR data for compound X. Let's look at the IR first. The IR peaks are 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests an O-H stretch, probably from a carbonyl group. Wait, but more accurately, the 3400–2500 region is usually for X-H stretches. So O-H (like carboxylic acid or alcohol) or maybe N-H or something else. But the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H too, which is usually a broad peak around 3000. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, likely an O-H, as in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, if the compound X is reacting, then maybe the product is something else. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a phenol. But if it's a carboxylic acid, that would explain the IR 1720 as the carbonyl and the O-H around 10 ppm. But wait, the IR also has a 1720 peak which could be an ester or a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, let's parse the NMR signals. There's 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)—that's probably a carboxylic acid proton. Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)—so that's a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets suggest two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps in a para pattern, like a substituent on the benzene ring in the para position, such as a methyl group or something else.

Then 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)—could be a CH adjacent to something, maybe a CH next to a carbony
