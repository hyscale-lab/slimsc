Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, right, Li is lithium. So lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li-6 would be lithium with 3 protons and 3 neutrons because 3 + 3 = 6. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The number of neutrons is 3, so the mass number would be protons plus neutrons. Lithium has atomic number 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

So the problem is about finding the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. But wait, RHIC is a collider, so the particles are accelerated to a certain energy, which in particle physics terms is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes people refer to the total energy. Wait, but in colliders, the energy given is typically the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, in particle physics accelerators, when you say the energy of the particle, you usually mean the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially in high-energy physics
