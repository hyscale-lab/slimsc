Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And the question is about the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. So I need to calculate the mean decay length, which I think is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean decay length) is given by the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity. So, the formula should be something like L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, tau is the mean lifetime, which is related to the width Γ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Γ ≈ ħ / tau. Or wait, I think tau is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Let me get this right. The natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle: ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so here, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, so the lifetime tau is approximately ħ/(Γ). So tau = ħ/(Γ). 

Wait, wait, the relation is tau = ħ/(Γ), right? Because the width Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width of the resonance, and the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time gives ħ. So yes, tau is ħ divided by Γ.

So first, I need to calculate the lifetime tau. Then, find the velocity of the particle, then compute gamma (the Lorentz factor), then multiply by c (speed of light) and tau to get L.

But wait, the particle is a meson, so it's a boson, but the calculation should be the same as for any particle.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute tau: tau = ħ / Γ
2. Compute the velocity beta = v/c. Since beta is approximately sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)), where E is the total energy. Wait, because E is given as
