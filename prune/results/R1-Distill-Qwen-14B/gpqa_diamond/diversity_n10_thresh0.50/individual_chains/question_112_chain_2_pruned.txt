Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a state vector |alpha> for an electron, and it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I probably need to normalize this state because the question says it's "proportional to," meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, normalization. Right. The state vector's components are (1+i) and (2-i). To find the normalization factor, I think I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself. So the norm squared is the sum of the absolute values squared of each component.

Calculating the norm squared: |1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2, and |2-i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4+1=5. So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now the next part of the question is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the basis here? Since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z, then the operator A is given in the same basis.

Wait, the matrix A would be 2x2 since it's for spin-1/2. So A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So matrix A is:

[0    ħ/2
 ħ/2  0 ]

Hmm, so this looks like a spin operator along the x-axis. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and when multiplied by ħ/2, that's exactly what A is. So the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the eigen
