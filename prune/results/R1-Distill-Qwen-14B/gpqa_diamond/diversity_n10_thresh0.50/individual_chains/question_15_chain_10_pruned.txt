Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think through this.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

The question gives some specific details. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations a bit.

The host stars are interesting. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both have the same radii. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. So M1 = 2*M2, R1 = R2.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something else?), but wait, more accurately, the geometric probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no. The transit probability (P) is approximately the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the size of the star, but considering the alignment. Oh wait, actually, the probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but the exact formula is more like the area of the star compared to the area where the planet can be in front. Or perhaps it's more precise to think in terms of the impact parameter.

Wait, I think the geometric probability is (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - eÂ²)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular, e=0. So it simplifies. Oh wait, no, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * something. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 + (R_s / R_p) * (1 + ... ) )) No, perhaps I should look it up in my notes.

Oh wait, I think I'm confusing the transit depth and the probability. Let me think. The probability of a transit is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. This is a geometric probability.

The formula for the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (R_s + R_p) / (R_s * (1 - ( (R_s + R_p) / a )) ), or something like that. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a simpler approach. The transit probability is roughly (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 + sqrt(1 - ( (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2 )) )) ), but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability is approximately the area of the circular region where the planet can transit divided by the
