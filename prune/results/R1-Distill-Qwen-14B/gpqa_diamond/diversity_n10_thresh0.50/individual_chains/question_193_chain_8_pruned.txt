Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, right! Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula I remember is plx = 1/distance, but wait, is that in parsecs? Oh right, distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So distance r = 1/plx. Or maybe I should write it as plx = 1/(r), where r is in parsecs. Yeah, that's right.

So the number of stars, let's call it N, varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since r = 1/plx, I can substitute plx in terms of r. Let's see, plx = 1/r. So substituting that into N, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, that can't be right because as distance increases, the number of stars would increase a lot? But wait, in reality, when you go further away, you can see more stars, but maybe up to a point. But according to this, N is proportional to r^5. So, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But the question is asking how the number changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. So the rate of change, like the derivative? Or maybe it's just the dependence on r.

Wait, no. The question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I think they're looking for the relation N as a function of r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases with r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is ~r^5. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and pl
