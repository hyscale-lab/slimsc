Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. Hmm.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So this must be a mixed state because the state is a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

I think when you have a density matrix like this, it's equivalent to a completely mixed state. But wait, how does that translate into the geometry of qubits? Oh right, qubits can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, right?

The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any pure state can be represented as a point on the surface of the sphere. For a mixed state, I think it's inside the sphere. Wait, in the case of a completely mixed state, like ρ = I/2 (where I is the identity matrix), the state is in the center of the Bloch sphere. Because when you have equal probability of being in |0> and |1>, which are orthogonal, the state doesn't have any preference in direction, so it's at the origin.

Wait, let me get this straight. The Bloch vector r is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli vectors. So for a general 2x2 density matrix, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). 

So let's compute this. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of Pauli matrices. Hmm, wait, no. Alternatively, I can express |0><0| as (I + |0><0| - |1><1|)/2, but maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, let's expand ρ. Let me write the density matrix elements. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them: [[1,0], [0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is (1/2) * I.

So ρ = I/2. Now, when I write the general form ρ = (I + r_xσ_x + r_yσ_y + r_zσ_z)/2. Comparing, since ρ is I/2, that implies that all the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero. So r = (0,0,0). 

So the Bloch vector is at the origin, which makes sense because it's the completely mixed state. So the point in the qubit space is at (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that's the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state of a qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, which is the geometric space for qubit states, the position of a state is determined by its Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\). For a general density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), which is \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is evident that all coefficients \(r_x, r_y, r_z\) must be zero. This means the Bloch vector \(r\) is at the origin, \((0,0,0)\).

The completely mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is consistent with the geometric interpretation of the given density matrix. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:
