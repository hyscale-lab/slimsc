Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. There are stability constants given for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to recall what stability constants represent. The stability constant (β) for a complex indicates how stable the complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable. The formula for the nth complex would be something like [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), I think. So, the complexes here are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that the blue color is associated with the tetraaqua dithiocyanato complex, perhaps? Or wait, maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex? Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right? Because each SCN- is a monodentate ligand, and Co is in +2 oxidation state. So each SCN- contributes -1, so two would give -2. Co^2+ plus two SCN^- gives overall neutral. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2].

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the color. Alternatively, the tetraaqua might be another case. But I think the problem is asking about the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, as it's dithiocyanato.

So the problem is about the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] relative to all cobalt species. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2] among all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion.

The total cobalt concentration is given as 0.01 M. That includes all the species: free Co^2+ and all the complexes from [CoSCN]^+ (n=1) up to [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4).

So, the approach is to find the distribution of Co among these complexes. Since the solution has a high concentration of SCN- (0.1 M), the complexation should be significant.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a little confusing because β4 is lower than β3. So the third complex is the most stable, perhaps.

Hmm, but wait, the stability constants are for each successive addition of SCN
