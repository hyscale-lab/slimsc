Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters.

Wait, so I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. The formula I think I need is the mean decay length, which is the product of the velocity of the particle and its lifetime. Decay length L = v * τ. 

But wait, τ is the mean lifetime, which relates to the decay width Γ. I think Γ is the total decay width, and the relation between Γ and τ is Γ = ħ/τ. Or wait, Γ is the decay rate, so τ is the inverse of the decay rate multiplied by some constants. Let me get the formula right. 

The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, no, wait. Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width corresponding to the uncertainty in the particle's lifetime. So Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

But wait, I've also heard about the natural line width and uncertainty principle. Yeah, so the decay width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So, the bigger Γ is, the shorter the lifetime, which makes sense because a wider width means a shorter time—like a particle decaying quickly if it has a large width.

So first, let me compute the lifetime τ. Then, I need the velocity v of the meson to find the decay length. 

But how do I find the velocity? Well, the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. But since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², maybe I can work with units that make this easier. Wait, let's see. 

Wait, E is given as
