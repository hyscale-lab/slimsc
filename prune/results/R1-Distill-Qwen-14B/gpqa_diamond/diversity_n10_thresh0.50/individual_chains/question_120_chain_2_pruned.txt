Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, first, what do I know about parallax? Parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The formula I remember is that the distance d (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax plx (in arcseconds), so d = 1/plx. Oh right, that's correct.

Now, the question says the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant. So, the number density n is the same throughout space. Number density is the number of stars per unit volume.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So, they want how the number of stars changes as the parallax changes. Let me think about the relation between distance, volume, and parallax.

Since distance d is 1/plx, higher parallax means closer stars. So, for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let me see, if plx is small (distance is large), then the change in distance would be from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, maybe I should express it in terms of d.

Wait, let's think in terms of differential elements. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be N = n * 4π d² dr. Because the volume of a thin shell
