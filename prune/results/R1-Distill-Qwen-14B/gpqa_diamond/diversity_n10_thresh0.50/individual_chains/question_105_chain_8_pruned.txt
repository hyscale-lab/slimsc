Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun—same radius, right? So the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Now, one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Oh wait, filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% means 0.2 of the star's surface is covered.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I suppose, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? Wait, no, spots are cooler, so if the star is 6000 K, spots would be 5000 K. The question says a temperature difference of 1000 K, so spots are 5000 K.

But the key point here is that these spots are causing a photometric variation that mimics an exoplanet transit. So the problem is asking: if instead of spots, you had an exoplanet transiting the star, what would the planet's radius have to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spots are causing.

The question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So when a planet transits a star, it blocks some light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. Similarly, the spots would cause a dip in brightness when they're facing us, but wait, no—the star is rotating, so as the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness would dip.

Wait, but the star is being observed in photometric time series. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness variation would be due to the spots modulating the light curve.

But the question says that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is similar to that of an exoplanet. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip as the spots.

So, to approach this, I think we need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and set that equal to the fractional change caused by the
