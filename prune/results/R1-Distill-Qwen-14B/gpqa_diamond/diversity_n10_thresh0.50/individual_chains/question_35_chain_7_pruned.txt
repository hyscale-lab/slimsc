Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about angular momentum operators. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. 

Alright, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. They're telling me that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, I think S is the Pauli Y-matrix. Because Pauli matrices are 2x2, and their Y-matrix has 0, -i in the top row and i, 0 in the bottom.

So, the matrix Ay would be c times this S. Let me write that down. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so multiplying by c = h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Wait, but before that, the question is asking which statement among the options is correct regarding this calculation.

Let me think about the possible statements.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right. Because eigenvalues of a matrix like Ay would be scalar values. Wait, but angular momentum operators usually have eigenvalues related to ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Let me think again.

Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So, if Ay = c*S, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1). So, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a would be (h/(4π)) * (1) and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly say this. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1
