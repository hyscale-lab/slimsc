Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal, and all the angles are the same. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices. But wait, wait. For a rhombohedral system, the formula might be a bit different because all the angles are the same.

Wait, no, the general formula applies to any crystal system. But in a rhombohedral structure, since alpha = beta = gamma, maybe there's a simpler way. So for the (111) plane, the Miller indices are l=1, m=1, n=1.

Let me plug in the values. So a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. The angles are each 30 degrees. So cos(alpha) is cos(30). Let me calculate cos(30), which is approximately sqrt(3)/2, about 0.8660.

So plugging into the formula: d = a / sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) )

Let me compute the denominator first. The numerator inside the sqrt is 1 + 1 +1 =3. Then the subtracted terms are 2*1*1*0.8660 each, and there are three such terms because each pair of indices (lm, ln, mn) is multiplied by their respective cos terms. So 3 terms each of 2*0.8660.

Wait, wait, more accurately: each of the three terms is 2*l m cos α, 2 l n cos beta, 2 m n cos gamma. Since l=m=n=1
