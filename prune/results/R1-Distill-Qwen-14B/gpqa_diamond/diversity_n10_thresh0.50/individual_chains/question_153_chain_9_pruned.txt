Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question presents three different reactions, A, B, and C, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I'll match the options A, B, C, or D based on the given choices.

Starting with reaction A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a diester, so under basic conditions (like NaOEt), it should form the enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Let me visualize the structures.

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=C(p-Tol)CO2Me. Wait, no, more precisely, the acrylate would be something like CH2-CH2? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)CO2Me? No, wait, wait. The correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl group on C3. So it's CH2-CH-(p-Tol)-CO2Me, but in the E configuration. So the groups on either side of the double bond are the methyl ester and the p-tolyl.

Wait, no, correction: the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)CO2Me? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R, so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have
