Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration is 0.02 M for the Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the EDTA's form or anything. The temperature is 25°C, but I think that's just standard conditions, so the K value is given at that temp.

Hmm. So the Ca-EDTA complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, right? So each Ca²+ ion binds with one EDTA^4- ion. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I remember that when a complex ion forms, the formation constant K represents how much the complex forms from its ions. The formation constant equation should be something like:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but in this case, the solution contains the complex, so the complex is already formed. So [Ca-EDTA] is given as 0.02 M.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], so I need to find that. But I also have to consider the dissociation of the complex. Because the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, if the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, the total concentration of Ca is coming from the dissociation of the complex. Because if the complex doesn't dissociate much, the free Ca²+ would be low.

Let me think. The formation constant tells us the extent to which Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine. Since K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning the dissociation is minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions will be very small compared to the concentration of the complex.

So, perhaps I can model this using the K expression. Let's denote the concentration of Ca-EDTA as [C] = 0.02 M. The dissociation reaction is:

Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is 5e10. So, the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have a K of 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Let me denote the dissociation as follows:

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is C - x, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are each x. Because the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So, substituting into the K expression for the dissociation:

K_dissociation = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA] = x * x / (0.02 - x) = (x²)/(0.02 - x) = 2e-11.

But since K is very small (2e-11), x is going to be much smaller than 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the equation to x² / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11.

So, solving for x²:

x² ≈ (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root of both sides, x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, right? So sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 = approximately 6.32e-7 M.

But wait, let me double-check.
