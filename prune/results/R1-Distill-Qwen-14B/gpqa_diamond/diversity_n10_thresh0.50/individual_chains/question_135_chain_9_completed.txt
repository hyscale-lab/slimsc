Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and decay modes. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I should probably figure out what kind of particles X can decay into. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' combined mass must be less than the mass of X. Because in particle physics, a particle can only decay into lighter particles.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it seems like X interacts with fermions. The interaction term is proportional to X(y) times ψ̄_f ψ_f. So X can couple to fermion-antifermion pairs. The fermions involved would be the ones present in the Lagrangian, right? Wait, but the Lagrangian says ψ_f, which I think refers to fermion fields. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to.

But wait, the fermion types are important here. The problem probably assumes that X couples to all possible fermions, but some might have masses that are too high for X to decay into them.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV. Wait, actually, each fermion has a rest mass. So the combined mass of the pair must be less than X's mass.

Wait, no. Each fermion has a mass m_f. So for each fermion f, the mass of X must be greater than 2 m_f, because each fermion in the pair has mass m_f. So 2 m_f < M_X. So M_X must be greater than twice the mass of the fermion.

So let's list the known fermion masses. From what I remember:

- electrons (e) are about 0.0005 GeV
- muons (μ) are about 0.1 GeV
- taus (τ) are around 1.78 GeV
- up quarks (u) are very light, like ~0.003 GeV
- down quarks (d) are about 0.004-0.005 GeV
- strange (s) is about 0.095 GeV
- charm (c) is about 1.27 GeV
- bottom (b) is about 4.1-4.7 GeV
- top (t) is super heavy, like 173 GeV

Wait, let me get some precise numbers. Maybe I should jot them down:

Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV ≈ 0.000511 GeV
Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV ≈ 0.1057 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1777 MeV ≈ 1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV ≈ 0.0022 GeV
Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV ≈ 0.0047 GeV
Strange (s): ~95 MeV ≈ 0.095 GeV
Charm (c): ~127.5 MeV ≈ 0.1275 GeV? Wait, no, wait that's 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 127.5 MeV is 0.1275 GeV? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 127.5 MeV is 0.1275 GeV, but that's way too light. Wait, no, no, I think I messed up. Because charm quarks are actually around 1.27 GeV each. Wait, let me check:

Wait, I'm getting confused. For quarks:

u: ~2 MeV
d: ~4.7 MeV
s: ~95 MeV
c: ~1275 MeV (~1.275 GeV)
b: ~4700 MeV (~4.7 GeV)
t: ~173,000 MeV (~173 GeV)

Ah, okay, I see. So for a fermion f, the mass m_f is:

e: ~0.0005 GeV
mu: ~0.106 GeV
tau: ~1.777 GeV
u: 0.0022 GeV
d: 0.0047 GeV
s: 0.095 GeV
c: 1.275 GeV
b: 4.7 GeV
t: 173 GeV

So, X has a mass of 6 GeV. Therefore, for X to decay into f f̄, we must have 2 m_f < M_X. Alternatively, m_f < M_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So let's see which fermions have m_f < 3 GeV.

Check each one:

e: 0.0005 < 3 → yes
mu: 0.106 <3 → yes
tau: 1.777 <3 → yes
u: 0.0022 → yes
d: 0.0047 → yes
s: 0.095 → yes
c: 1.275 → yes
b: 4.7 → 4.7 >3 → no
t: 173 → way over → no

Wait, but wait, I think I missed something. The tau is 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so 2 m_tau would be about 3.55 GeV. Oh wait, wait, no, 2 * 1.777 is 3.554 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, then 6 GeV is larger than 3.554 GeV, so yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait, wait, no, what's the condition again? The sum of the masses of the two particles must be less than the mass of X. Because energy and momentum must allow for that decay. So for a fermion f, the rest mass is m_f. The decay products are f and f_bar, each with mass m_f. So the combined rest mass is 2 m_f. But because in the center of mass frame, the total energy is M_X, the condition is that 2 m_f ≤ M_X.

Wait, not exactly. Because in reality, the total energy is M_X, but the rest mass of the decay products is 2 m_f. So the rest mass can't exceed M_X. Because you can't have a total rest mass greater than the parent particle's rest mass. So yes, 2 m_f ≤ M_X.

So for each fermion, if 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV, then X can decay into that fermion-antifermion pair.

So let me recalculate:

Compute 2 m_f for each fermion:

e: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → yes
mu: 2 * 0.106 = 0.212 → yes
tau: 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.554 → 3.554 <6 → yes
u: 2 * 0.0022 ≈ 0.0044 → yes
d: 2 * 0.0047 ≈ 0.0094 → yes
s: 2 * 0.095 = 0.19 → yes
c: 2 * 1.275 = 2.55 → 2.55 <6 → yes
b: 2 *4.7 =9.4 → 9.4 >6 → no
t: 2 *173=346>6 → no

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion has m_f < 3 GeV. So that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. But not b or t.

So the possible decay channels are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u u_bar
d d_bar
s s_bar
c c_bar

Wait, but wait. Are there any other considerations? Like, the interaction term in the Lagrangian determines which fermions X can couple to. The given Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X couples to all fermions f, because the term is ψ̄ f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). Or perhaps, the coefficient λ depends on the fermion type. But the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, regardless of the fermion type. So I think X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as kinetically allowed.

So the possible decay products are all the above-mentioned fermions.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Wait, but b has m=4.7 GeV. 2 m_b=9.4 GeV>6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Wait, c has m=1.275 GeV. 2 m_c=2.55 GeV<6. So allowed. So this option includes c, which is allowed. But what about the others? Let's see.

Option B includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. All of these are allowed, except what about the others? Oh, option B includes these.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

But t is way too heavy (173 GeV each, 2 m_t=346>6), so t tbar is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

But again, b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option would be the one that includes all the allowed fermions except the heavy ones.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B includes c cbar, which is allowed. So B is c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but the problem's options are:

Option A: b, s, u, d, tau, e

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e

Option C: c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e

Option D: b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e

So the correct decay channels must include all fermions where 2 m_f <6 GeV.

Which is:

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So that's the set in option B.

Wait, but option B includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c, which are all allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.

Let me just double-check. For each of these:

e: yes, 2*0.0005=0.001<6 → allowed.

mu: 2*0.106=0.212 → allowed.

tau: 2*1.777=3.554 <6 → allowed.

u: 0.0044 <6 → allowed.

d: 0.0094 <6 → allowed.

s: 0.19 <6 → allowed.

c: 2.55 <6 → allowed.

Yes, all in B are allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decay products of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, and the decay is allowed if the combined rest mass of the decay products is less than the mass of \( X \). This requires \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

The fermion masses are approximately:

- \( e \): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 0.106 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f\bar{f} \), the condition \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must hold. Checking each fermion:

- \( e \): \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( \mu \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.212 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( \tau \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( u \): \( 2m_u = 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( d \): \( 2m_d = 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( s \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( c \): \( 2m_c = 2.55 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( b \): \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → not allowed.
- \( t \): \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → not allowed.

Thus, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs: \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \).

Answer: B
