Okay, let's see. I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. So, the question is a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down.

The first part says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of neutrons and protons... Wait, protons and neutrons are in the nucleus. So the molecule of W must have a nucleus where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. But wait, the molecule is a gas, so maybe it's a diatomic gas like H2, O2, N2, etc. Let me think. If the molecule is something like H2, each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (since it's a heavier isotope, maybe deuterium?), but then each has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. But that doesn't necessarily mean the molecule has equal numbers. Wait, noâ€”the molecule itself has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, say O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same number. That fits. So gas W is O2? Or maybe another molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, what's another possibility? Let's see. If the molecule is something like CH4, that's not di
