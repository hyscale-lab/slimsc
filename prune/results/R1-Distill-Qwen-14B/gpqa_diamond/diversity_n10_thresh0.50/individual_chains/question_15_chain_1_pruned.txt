Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the size of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. But the host stars have different masses. The host of Planet 1 is twice as massive as Planet 2's host, but both stars have the same radius because the Planet 2's host is slightly evolved. Oh, right, evolved stars might expand, but here they have same radius.

So the probability of transit, P, is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (2R_s)), where R_p is the planet radius, R_s the star radius, and a the semi-major axis (which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law). But wait, I'm not sure if I remember the exact formula. Or maybe it's P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (2R_s)) )? Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a / (R_s * sqrt{something} )). Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times (a / (R_s)) ) times some factor, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Let me think about Kepler's third law. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P and the star's mass M. Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a is proportional to (P² * GM)^(1/3). 

Wait, but in this question, both planets have the same minimum mass, but we're talking about their semi-major axes. The orbital period of Planet 1 is three times shorter than Planet 2. So P1 = P2 /3. Using Kepler's law: a³ ∝ (P² * M), where M is the mass of the host star. 

So for Planet 1, a₁³ ∝ ( (P1)² * M1 ). Similarly, a₂³ ∝ ( (P2)^2 * M2 ). 

Given that P1 = P2 /3, and M1 = 2*M2.

So substituting:

a₁³ ∝ ( (P2² / 9) * 2 M2 ) = (2/9) P2² M2.

a₂³ ∝ (P2² * M2).

So a₁³ = (2/9) * a₂³. Therefore, a₁ = a₂ * (2/9)^(1/3). Let's compute (2/9)^(1/3). 

2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a₁ is roughly 0.6 * a₂. So a₁ is smaller than a₂.

Wait, but wait, the exact ratio is (2/9)^(1/3) = (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3))
