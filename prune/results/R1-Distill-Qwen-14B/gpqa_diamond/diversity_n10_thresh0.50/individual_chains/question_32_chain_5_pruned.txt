Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic effects become significant. The energy of a relativistic particle isn't just its rest mass energy; it includes kinetic energy as well.

I think the formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m_0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the gamma formula.

Let me calculate gamma first. So v = 0.96c. Then v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me compute that: sqrt(0.0784) equals 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1 divided by 0.28.

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/(28/100) is 100/28. Let me compute that. 100 divided by 28: 28*3=84, 28*3.57 is 28*3=84, 28*0.57=15.96. So 84+15.96=99.96. So 3.5714 is approximately 3.5714... So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m_0 c². The mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the mass deficit due to binding energy (mass defect). Wait, but for heavy ions, the mass is approximately the sum
