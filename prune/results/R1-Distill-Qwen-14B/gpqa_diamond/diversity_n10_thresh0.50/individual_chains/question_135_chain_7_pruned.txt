Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of the boson, and I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed. Hmm, let me think.

First, I should recall some basic particle physics. The Lagrangian given is for the interaction between a boson X and some fermions. The term looks like this:

L(y) = -λ_f f(y) (ῡψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, maybe I miswrote that. Let me parse it again. Oh, right, the interaction term is probably something like -λ f ψ̄ f X ψ_f. So X is a boson field interacting with fermions. So X is a boson, like maybe a scalar or vector boson? The problem doesn't specify, but for decay purposes, perhaps it's a real scalar because it's written as X(y) without derivatives.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle (by conservation of energy and the fact that the rest frame energy is the mass). So each decay product must be a fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion's mass is less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV each.

Wait, because if X → f f̄, the maximum mass each f can have is (M_X)/2. Since M_X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let me list the known fermions and their masses.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But their masses are tricky because in reality, they depend on the energy scale, but for this problem, I think we take their current masses. Let's see:

u: ~2 MeV (negligible)
d: ~4-5 MeV
s: ~95-100 MeV
c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
b: ~4.5-5 GeV
t: way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ), and their neutrinos. But since neutrinos are very light, perhaps negligible. So relevant ones are e, μ, τ.

Masses:
e: ~0.5 MeV (so way under 3 GeV)
μ: ~105 MeV
τ: ~1.78 GeV.

So the fermions that can be produced are those with mass ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the possible fermions:

- u, d, s: all masses much less than 3 GeV.
- c: about 1.5 GeV, so yes.
- b: about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV
