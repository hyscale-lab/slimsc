Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out what Substance X is. It's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, which makes me think of something like a strong base or maybe something like Grignard reagent? Or perhaps something else. Wait, the problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Heavier isotopes could be in something like Cl, which has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37. Wait, but maybe it's something else.

Looking at the reaction: X reacts with liquid Y. Let's think about common reactions. Maybe Y is water? Because a lot of reactions happen with water. Alternatively, Y could be an acid or a base. But if X is a metal, perhaps Y is an acid. Wait, but let me think about the gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, the total protons and neutrons are equal. Wait, but for each molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the number of protons.

Wait, no, wait. Each molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, H2O has 8 neutrons (for oxygen) and H has 1 each. No, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe it's something like CO2? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps it's a molecule with H2O? No. Wait, maybe the gas is NH3? No, because NH3 has 14 (N) + 3*(1) = 17. But that's not equal. Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2? O2 has 16 each, so 16*
