Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when we have a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. 

Hmm, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution is at a pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex with Ca²+ ions. The formation constant, K_ca-edta, is given as 5x10^10. 

I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like Ca²+ forming a stable complex. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. A high Kf like 5e10 means the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex.

The formula for the formation of the complex is probably something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in this case, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex already. The concentration is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The question is, what's the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution?

Wait, when the complex dissociates, each CaEDTA^2- releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- ion. So the dissociation equation would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, which is the same as the inverse of the dissociation constant Kd. Because Kd is the dissociation constant, so Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. 

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 M minus the amount that dissociated. But since Kd is very small (2e-11), the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M.

Assuming x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So plug into Kd: Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02.

We know Kd is 2e-11. So:

x² = (2e-11) * 0.02
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1
