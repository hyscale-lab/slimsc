Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints provided. Let's break down each part.

First, the reaction steps. I think each step is a transformation from one compound to another, so I need to figure out what each step does and how the structures change.

Starting with Compound A. When it reacts with HCN, it forms B. HCN is typically a nucleophile. The reaction of ketones with HCN forms cyanohydrins. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, it would form a cyanohydrin as well. But wait, the IR hint says that A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so A is likely a ketone. Because aldehydes have their C=O around 1700-1750, but maybe the exact value depends on substitution. But the peak is at 1750, which is more in line with a ketone. So A is a ketone.

So, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin would have an additional -CN group and an -OH group added next to the carbonyl. So structure of B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group adjacent.

Next, Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Hydrogenation of a nitrile (cyanide group) would typically reduce it to an amine. Wait no, H2 with Pd is usually for hydrogenation. So if B is a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and -CN group attached to a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group or something. Wait, let me think about the structure.

Wait, when a ketone (A) reacts with HCN, it adds the cyanide to the carbonyl carbon, forming a new carbon with -OH and -CN groups. So for example, if A is cyc
