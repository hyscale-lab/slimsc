Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand the brightness criteria for each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. Oh, right, the question says "brighter than 17 mag." Wait, no, no, magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Let me think. The lower the apparent magnitude, the brighter the star appears. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than a certain magnitude, it's looking for those with lower (more negative or smaller positive) magnitudes. But wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag", so that means the stars must have apparent V magnitudes less than 17? Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude brighter than 17, meaning their apparent V mag is less than 17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with apparent V mag less than 16. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V mag must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17, so it'll be detectable by both.

Wait, wait no. Let me double-check. ESPRESSO: stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So apparent V mag â‰¤17? Because the scale is such that brighter objects have lower (or more negative) magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So the limit is m <17 for ESPRESSO, m <16 for HIRES. So to be detected by both, m has to be less than 16.

So the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because that's the more restrictive condition. So any star
