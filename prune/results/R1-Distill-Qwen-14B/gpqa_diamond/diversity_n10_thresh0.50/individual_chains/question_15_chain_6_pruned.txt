Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet_1 or Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability because they have limited time. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. But wait, since both planets have circular orbits, maybe that simplifies things. Oh, right, the transit probability is given by the formula: P â‰ˆ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a^2)), but wait, no, maybe it's more about the orbital distance relative to the star's size. Wait, I think the probability is higher when the star is smaller (because R_p/R_s is larger) and when the orbital distance is smaller, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a/(R_s * (1 + m_p / M_s)))))^2. Hmm, no, I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a
