Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, where e is the elementary charge, right? Their mass is negligible, so we don't have to worry about that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So the setup is that 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P, and one charge is at P. All charges are identical and have a charge of 2e. Since they're all the same charge, they'll repel each other. So the potential energy between them would be due to their mutual repulsion.

Wait, but since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the 12 others are at 2m from P, each of those 12 has a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. But the other 11 charges among those 12 are each 2 meters from P, but they are also some distance away from each other. Hmm, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so maybe their mutual distances can vary, but each is 2m from P. But for the purposes of potential energy calculation, perhaps we can model them as being on a sphere of radius 2m centered at P. But that might complicate things because their positions relative to each other matter.

Wait, but calculating the potential energy between all pairs might be the way to go. Because the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Right, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all charges are the same, each pair contributes the same amount.

So first, let's list all the pairs. The 13th charge is fixed, so it interacts with each of the 12 charges. Then, among the 12 charges, each pair contributes as well. So it's the sum of two parts: the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, plus the potential energy between each of the 12 charges.

Wait, no, the
