Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. I remember that electric potential energy is related to the arrangement of charges, right?

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, making it 3.2 x 10^-19 C. But wait, wait, the problem says 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So I guess the 13th is at the center, and the 12 are arranged around it, each 2 meters away.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, in an isolated system, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes repulsion. But wait, since all the charges are positive (because they're 2e, and e is positive), they repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, you'd arrange them in a way that the repulsion is as small as possible. Wait, but how?

Wait, no. Wait. The potential energy between point charges is given by the formula U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. Since all charges are positive, each pair contributes positively to the total potential energy. So the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, the system is isolated, so we can't have them moving freely. The 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the central charge.

Wait a minute, the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. So the potential energy is determined by the configuration of the charges. But since the 12 charges are fixed at 2m, their positions relative to each other might affect the total potential energy. Hmm, wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. But how are they arranged among themselves? Like, are they placed on a sphere of radius 2m around P?

Wait, but if the 12 charges are all on a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between any two of them would be less than 4m (since two points on a sphere of radius r are at most 2r apart). But in this case, for 12 charges, perhaps they form a regular icosahedron or something like that around the central charge.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is about the potential energy of the entire system. So I have to consider all the pairs of charges and calculate the sum of their potential energies.

So, the system has 13 charges: one at P, and 12 on a sphere of radius 2 m around P.

Each of the 12 charges will interact with the central charge. Also, each of the 12 charges will interact with every other of the 12 charges.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of:

1. The potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Hmm, but wait, the central charge is fixed, so the 12 charges can't move closer or farther from it. So their distances to P are fixed at 2m.

But for the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves, since they're fixed on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two charges depends on their angular separation. Oh, but in the case of minimizing the total potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves in a configuration that minimizes the sum of all their mutual potentials.

Wait, but since all the charges are identical and positive, the potential energy between any two is positive. So to minimize the total potential energy, we'd need the sum of all these positive terms to be as small as possible. But wait, for a system of identical positive charges, the most stable configuration (which would have the lowest potential energy) is when they are as far apart as possible. But in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so their positions relative to each other are fixed in a way—so the system's potential energy is determined by their arrangement on the sphere.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the charges are arranged in the configuration that minimizes the sum of the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges. But for a fixed radius, the sum of the potentials between the charges would depend on how they're arranged. Wait, but for N charges on a sphere, the minimal potential energy occurs when they are equally spaced, forming a regular polyhedron. For 12 charges, perhaps they form an icosahedron, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and not the potential energy between the 12 themselves. Because if the 12 are fixed in place, their mutual potential energy might be a fixed value, but the problem is perhaps only asking for the potential energy contributed by the central charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the interactions with the central charge, and the interactions between the 12 are neglected. Because 12 charges on a sphere each at 2m, but perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, not the mutual interactions among the 12.

Wait, but the problem says the system consists of 13 charges. So the total potential energy would include all pairs. But perhaps the question is only asking about the potential energy between the 12 and the central charge, and not their mutual interactions.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the 12 charges are all identical and repel each other, so their mutual potential energy would contribute to the total. But maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, not the 12-choose-2 pairs.

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions relative to each other are fixed—meaning that the distances between them are fixed as well. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute their mutual potential energies. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the central charge to each of the 12.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the mutual potential energies among the 12 charges are fixed, and the only variable is the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge.

Wait, but the problem says the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the 12 are at 2m from P. So the 12 are fixed in their positions relative to P, but their positions relative to each other might vary, but perhaps the problem is assuming that they are all at the same distance from each other, or perhaps they are arranged in a way that the mutual potential is a fixed value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified to ignore the mutual interactions, but that's unlikely because that would be a significant part of the potential energy.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is zero. No, that doesn't make sense. Because like charges repel, their mutual potential energy would be positive. So the total potential energy must include all pairs.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. Let's think about the problem again.

The system has 13 charges: 1 at P, 12 at 2m from P. Each charge is 2e.

So, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e.

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with the central charge. Also, each pair of the 12 charges contributes a term.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of:

U = U_central + U_mutual

Where U_central is the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and U_mutual is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

Calculating U_central is straightforward. Each of the 12 charges is distance 2m from P. So the potential energy for each pair is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e * 2e) / (2m).

But wait, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = (k_e * q1 q2) / r, where k_e is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy relative to the central charge is (k_e * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m).

So the energy for one charge is (k_e * (2e)^2) / (2 * 2) ? Wait, no. Let me get that right. Wait, the distance between the central charge and each surrounding charge is 2m. So r is 2m. So U for each pair is k_e * (2e)(2e) / (2m).

So each pair contributes U = (k_e * (2e)^2) / (2m).

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total U_central is 12 * that value.

Now, U_mutual is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges. Since each of the 12 is 2m away from P, but their distances from each other depend on their arrangement. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, and not the mutual potential between the 12.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere of radius 2m is such that the mutual potential energies between them are minimized, i.e., the sum of U_ij for each pair (i,j) among the 12 is as small as possible.

Wait, but all the charges are positive. So the potential energy between any two is positive. To minimize the total potential energy, the sum of all U_ij should be as small as possible. But since each U_ij is positive, the minimal sum would be when all U_ij are as small as possible. Which arrangement achieves that?

Wait, placing the charges as far apart as possible on the sphere would minimize each U_ij. But for a fixed radius, the maximum possible distance between any two charges would be 4m (diametrically opposite). But the minimal sum would require that each pair is as far apart as possible, which isn't possible for all pairs. So perhaps the minimal sum occurs when the charges are arranged in a way that each pair is as far as possible on average.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that would only be the case if they're arranged in a way that all the forces cancel out, which isn't possible with all positive charges.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual interactions between the 12. Let's try that approach.

So, U_central = 12 * (k_e * (2e)^2) / (2m)

Let me compute that.

First, e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So (2e) = 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 ≈ 10.26 x 10^-38 C².

k_e is about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

r is 2 meters.

So each pair's U is (8.988e9) * (10.26e-38) / (2 * 2).

Wait, no, wait. Each pair contributes (k_e * (2e)^2) / r.

Wait, but wait, the formula is U = (k_e * q1 q2) / r. So with q1 = q2 = 2e.

So U for one pair is (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2)

Wait, because r is 2 m.

So let's compute that.

First, (2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.26e-38 C².

So U_one = (8.988e9) * (10.26e-38) / 2.

Let me compute that step by step.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 10.26e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

10.26e-38 = 1.026 x 10^-37.

So 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = (8.988 * 1.026) x 10^(9-37) = approx 9.23 x 10^-28.

Then, divide by 2: 9.23e-28 / 2 ≈ 4.615e-28 J.

That's the potential energy for one pair between the central charge and a surrounding charge.

Since there are 12 such pairs, U_central = 12 * 4.615e-28 ≈ 55.38e-28 J, which is 5.538e-27 J.

Wait, but that's just the U_central part. What about the U_mutual part between the 12 charges?

The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the entire system. So I can't ignore the mutual potential energies. But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute U_mutual. But perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions. Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energy is zero, which isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. That might be a simplification. Because otherwise, the problem is too complex without knowing the exact arrangement.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the mutual potential energy would be a significant part. Let me think: for each pair of the 12 charges, the distance between them would vary, but let's assume that on average, each pair is at a certain distance.

Wait, but without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and not the mutual interactions among the 12. Because otherwise, the problem is too ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energies cancel each other out, but that's only possible if they're arranged in a neutral configuration, which isn't possible with all positive charges.

Wait, but maybe each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 4 meters apart, but that's not possible for 12 points on a sphere of radius 2 meters. The maximum distance would be 4 meters (diametrically opposite), but you can't have all pairs that far apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged on the vertices of a regular icosahedron around the central charge. In that case, the distance between neighboring charges would be the same. But I need to calculate the distance between two adjacent charges on a regular icosahedron of radius 2 m.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula for that. Maybe it's better to proceed with the assumption that the mutual potential energy is zero. But that's not possible because all charges are positive, so mutual potential energies are positive, and thus the total potential energy would be higher than the U_central part.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered negligible compared to the potential energy between each of them and the central charge. But that might not be the case, especially if the 12 charges are close to each other.

Wait, let's think about the magnitudes. The potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is 4.6e-28 J each, as calculated earlier. So 12 of those sum to about 5.5e-27 J.

Now, the potential energy between two of the 12 charges, each 2e, separated by a certain distance d. Let's say d is, say, 2 meters (but that's the distance from P, not between the charges). Wait, no, the charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, so the distance between any two would be less than or equal to 4m. Let's assume for simplicity that the average distance between two charges is about 2 * 2 * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as seen from P. But without knowing theta, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from each other. Is that possible? No, because they're all on a sphere of radius 2m around P. To be 2m apart, their separation would have to satisfy d^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2*(2)*(2)*cos(theta), from the law of cosines. So d^2 = 8 - 8 cos(theta). For d=2, 4 =8 (1 - cos(theta)) → 1 - cos(theta) = 0.5 → cos(theta)=0.5 → theta=60 degrees. So each pair is 60 degrees apart from P.

But that's impossible for 12 points on a sphere because you can't have all pairs separated by 60 degrees. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is a fixed value, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's not possible to compute.

Given that, perhaps the problem is simplifying and only expecting us to compute the potential energy between the central charge and the surrounding 12, ignoring the mutual potential energies. That would make the calculation straightforward, and the answer would be around 5.5e-27 J.

But looking at the options:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26 J → 5.6e-26 J.

B) 2.822 x 10^-26 → 2.8e-26 J.

C) 7.056 x 10^-27 → 7e-27 J.

D) 122.330 → way larger, probably not.

Wait, but earlier I calculated U_central as 5.538e-27 J. But the options don't have that exact value. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Each of the 12 charges has a potential energy with the central charge of U = k_e*(2e)^2 / (2 m).

Wait, 2e is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.26e-38 C².

k_e is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So U_one = (8.988e9) * (10.26e-38) / (2 * 2).

Wait, the denominator is r = 2 m.

So U_one = (8.988e9 * 10.26e-38) / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 * 10.26e-38:

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

10.26e-38 = 1.026 x 10^-37.

Multiplying them: 8.988 * 1.026 = approximately 9.226.

So 9.226e(9-37) = 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.613e-28 * 12 = 5.5356e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.536e-27 J, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest is option C: 7.056e-27, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, (2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.26e-38 C².

Yes.

Then, (k_e * (2e)^2) = 8.988e9 * 10.26e-38 = Let me compute that more accurately.

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 10^9.

10.26e-38 = 1.026 * 10^-37.

Multiplying them: 8.988 * 1.026 = let's compute it more accurately.

8 * 1.026 =8.208.

0.988 *1.026 ≈ (1-0.012)*(1.026) ≈ 1.026 - 0.012312 = 1.013688.

So total is 8.208 + 1.013688 ≈ 9.221688.

So 9.221688e-28 J per pair.

Divide by 2 (because r=2m): 9.221688e-28 / 2 ≈ 4.610844e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.610844e-28 * 12 = 5.5330128e-27 J.

So U_central ≈ 5.533e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another thought: perhaps the potential energy is (k_e * q1 q2 ) / r, and because the 12 charges are each contributing to the potential at P, but wait, no—the central charge is fixed, so each surrounding charge's potential energy is with respect to the central charge.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position. Since the central charge is fixed, when bringing each of the 12 charges, the potential at P due to the central charge is V = k_e * (2e) / (2m). Then, each charge contributes a potential energy of q * V, but since the charge is being placed in the potential due to the central charge, the energy is (2e) * V.

Wait, let me compute that.

V = (k_e * (2e)) / (2m).

So V = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19) / (2 * 2).

Wait, 8.988e9 * 3.204e-19 = (8.988 * 3.204) x 1e^(9-19) = approx 28.783e-10.

Divide by 4 (since 2m * 2) → 28.783e-10 / 4 ≈ 7.19575e-10 V.

Then, potential energy per charge is (2e) * V = (3.204e-19 C) * 7.19575e-10 V.

3.204e-19 * 7.19575e-10 = approx 2.303e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.303e-28 * 12 ≈ 2.7636e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.76e-27 J, which is not matching any options, but closer to option B (2.8e-26) but an order of magnitude lower.

Wait, that can't be right because the potential energy should be higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula.

Wait, the potential V at point P due to the central charge is (k_e * Q) / r, where Q is the charge at P, which is 2e, and r is 2m.

So V = (8.988e9) * (2e) / (2m).

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So V = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19) / (2 * 2).

So 8.988e9 * 3.204e-19 = let's compute this as 8.988 * 3.204 = approx 28.786.

So 28.786e-10 (since 1e9 * 1e-19 = 1e-10).

Divide by 4: 28.786e-10 /4 = 7.1965e-10 V.

Then, the potential energy for each charge is V * q, where q is 2e, so 3.204e-19 C.

So 7.1965e-10 V * 3.204e-19 C = approx 2.303e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.303e-28 * 12 = 2.7636e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before. So that's about 2.76e-27 J, which is not one of the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in considering the potential energy as V * q, but actually, the potential energy when bringing a charge into a potential is the charge multiplied by the potential at the location where it's being placed. But if the charge is being brought in from infinity, then the potential due to the existing charges at P must be considered.

Wait, but in the initial state, the central charge is fixed. So when placing each of the 12 charges, the potential at their location (2m from P) is due to the central charge. So the potential energy for each charge is q * V, where V is due to the central charge.

So for each charge, U_i = q * V = (2e) * (k_e * (2e) )/(2m).

Wait, so U_i = (2e) * [k_e (2e) / (2m) ].

Which is (4e² k_e)/(2m) = (2e² k_e)/m.

Wait, but e is 1.6e-19 C, so let me compute that.

(2 * (1.6e-19)^2 * 8.988e9 ) / 2.

Wait, because m is 2 meters.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused again. Let's compute it correctly.

Each U_i is (2e) * [ (k_e * 2e) / (2m) ) ]

So U_i = (2e * k_e * 2e) / (2m) ) = (4e² k_e) / (2m) ) = (2 e² k_e) / m.

So m is 2 m, so denominator is 2 m → 2 m = 2 * 2 =4? Wait, wait, no: m is 2 meters, so the denominator is 2 * 2 =4 meters? Wait, no, wait the formula is V = k_e * Q / r, where r is 2 meters.

So V = (k_e * 2e) / 2.

So U_i = (2e) * V = 2e * [k_e (2e) / 2 ].

Which is U_i = (2e * k_e * 2e) / 2 = (4 e² k_e) / 2 = 2 e² k_e.

Wait, that would be U_i = 2 e² k_e.

But that can't be right because the units don't make sense. E squared would be C², multiplied by k_e (N m²/C²), so U would be N m, which is Joules. So the units are correct.

So let's calculate 2 e² k_e.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

2 e² = 5.133e-38 C².

Multiply by k_e = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

5.133e-38 * 8.988e9 = ?

5.133e-38 * 8.988e9 = (5.133 * 8.988) x 1e( -38 +9 ) = approx 46.16 x 1e-29 = 4.616e-28 J.

So each U_i is 4.616e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.616e-28 * 12 = 5.539e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before. So about 5.54e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is also considered. Let's think about that.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and arranged on a sphere of radius 2m. The mutual potential energy between any two charges is U_ij = k_e (2e)(2e) / d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But without knowing d_ij, it's hard to compute. However, perhaps in the minimal energy arrangement, the mutual potential energy is zero. But that's impossible because all are positive, so U_ij is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual potential energy, assuming that the 12 charges are so arranged that their mutual potential energies cancel out, but that's not possible with all like charges.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's re-examine the options.

The options are:

A) 5.645e-26 → about 56e-27.

B) 2.822e-26 → about 28e-27.

C)7.056e-27 → 7e-27.

D)122.330 → much larger.

Earlier, I calculated U_central as about 5.5e-27 J. None of the options match that, but option C is 7e-27, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I see the mistake. The potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge is U = (k_e * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m).

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it as U = (k_e * (2e)^2) / (2m).

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2.

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

(3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 = approx 10.26, so 10.26e-38 C².

Yes.

So, U_one = (8.988e9) * (10.26e-38) / 2.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 10.26e-38 = 8.988 * 10.26 = about 92.27, so 92.27e-29 = 9.227e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6135e-28.

Multiply by 12: 55.362e-28 → 5.536e-27 J.

Which is about 5.536e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem expects us to consider only a single charge, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the charges. Wait, the problem says 13 identical particles. Each has charge 2e, so the central charge is 2e, and the 12 surrounding are 2e each.

Wait, but when calculating the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge, it's (k_e * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m).

Yes.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at P, but that's not relevant because the central charge is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, which includes each surrounding charge with the central charge, but also each pair of surrounding charges.

But earlier calculation shows that U_central is 5.5e-27 J.

Now, what about the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges?

Each pair contributes U_ij = (k_e * (2e)(2e)) / d_ij.

But without knowing d_ij, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that each pair is 2 meters apart. But that's not possible for 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m.

Alternatively, perhaps the average distance between two charges is 2m, which would make U_ij = (k_e (2e)^2) / 2m.

But that would mean each pair contributes the same as their central charge. So for the 12 charges, how many pairs are there? It's 12 choose 2, which is (12 * 11)/2 = 66 pairs.

So for each of the 66 pairs, U_ij = (8.988e9) * (10.26e-38) / (2).

Which is the same as U_one earlier: 4.613e-28 J per pair.

So 66 pairs would contribute 66 * 4.613e-28 = approx 3.045e-26 J.

Adding that to U_central (5.536e-27 J), the total U would be approx 3.045e-26 + 0.5536e-26 = 3.599e-26 J.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, but perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered differently. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's only possible if the charges are arranged in a way that their forces cancel, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only compute the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, and not the mutual part. In that case, the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k_e * (2e)^2 / (2m).

Let me recompute:

k_e = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19 C)^2 = 10.26e-38 C².

So k_e * (2e)^2 = 8.988e9 * 10.26e-38 = (8.988 * 10.26) x 1e(9-38) = 92.27... x 1e-29 = 9.227e-28.

Divide by (2m)=2*2=4 m: 9.227e-28 /4 = 2.30675e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.30675e-28 *12=2.768e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.768e-27 J, which is close to option B (2.822e-26) but an order of magnitude lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute 9.227e-28 divided by 4: 9.227e-28 /4 = 2.30675e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.768e-27 J.

So about 2.77e-27 J.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says 13 identical particles. Are all the charges 2e? Yes.

The 13th charge is fixed at P. The 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy of each of the 12 charges is the work done to bring them from infinity to their positions, considering the potential due to the central charge and the other 11 charges.

Ah, that's a different approach. So each charge would feel the potential from the central charge and from the other surrounding charges.

But that seems more complicated. Let me think.

When bringing the first charge, there's only the central charge at P. So the potential at 2m is V1 = k_e * (2e) / (2m).

The work done is (2e) * V1 = 2e * [k_e * 2e/(2m)] = (4 e² k_e)/(2m) = 2 e² k_e / m.

Wait, substituting m=2, it becomes 2 e² k_e /2 = e² k_e.

e² is (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38 C².

k_e=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² k_e = 2.56e-38 *8.988e9 = approx 2.304e-28 J.

Then when bringing the second charge, it would feel the potential from the central charge and the first charge.

So the potential at 2m would be V2 = (k_e * 2e)/(2m) + (k_e * 2e)/(d), where d is the distance between the first and second charge.

But without knowing d, it's hard to compute. But perhaps on average, each charge is equally spaced, so d is about 2 meters, but that's not correct because they are on a sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only compute the potential energy between the central charge and the surrounding charges, and not the mutual part. So that would give U_central = 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is intended to compute the potential energy of each charge in the field of all other charges, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of all possible pairs. So including the central charge with each of the 12, and each pair among the 12.

So U_total = U_central + U_mutual.

U_central = 12 * (k_e (2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 )/(2*2).

As before, this gives 5.536e-27 J.

U_mutual is the sum for all pairs among the 12: which is 66 pairs. Each pair's distance depends on their arrangement. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that each pair is separated by 2m, which is the distance from P. But that's not possible because they're on a sphere of radius 2m, so the maximum distance between any two is 4m. But perhaps the average distance is 2m.

If that's the case, each mutual pair contributes U_ij = (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 )/(2).

Which is 4.613e-28 J per pair.

So 66 pairs would contribute 66 * 4.613e-28 ≈ 3.045e-26 J.

So U_total = 5.536e-27 + 3.045e-26 ≈ 3.598e-26 J.

That's about 3.6e-26 J, which is closer to option A (5.645e-26), but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy sum is zero, which would make U_total = 5.5e-27 J.

But I'm not finding an option that matches.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy per charge, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.

The potential energy between two charges is U = (k_e * q1 q2) / r.

Each of the 12 charges has a potential energy with the central charge: U_central = 12 * [k_e * (2e)^2 / (2m)].

Each of the 66 pairs of the 12 charges contributes U_ij = [k_e * (2e)^2 ] / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem assumes that all r_ij are equal to 2m. But that's not possible because they're on a sphere, but perhaps the mutual distances are all 2m. That would imply that the 12 charges are arranged on a regular dodecahedron, but I'm not sure.

If all r_ij are 2m, then each U_ij is (k_e * (2e)^2 )/(2m).

Which is 4.613e-28 J per pair.

66 pairs → 66 * 4.613e-28 ≈ 3.045e-26 J.

Adding to U_central (5.536e-27 J):

Total U = 3.045e-26 + 5.536e-27 = 3.598e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to compute the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 charges, considering that the 12 are arranged in such a way that the mutual potential energy is the same as the central charge's contribution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, without considering the mutual potential. So the answer would be about 5.5e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J. Let me see what that would be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 12 * (k_e * (2e)^2 )/(2m).

k_e =8.988e9.

(2e) =3.204e-19.

(2e)^2=10.26e-38.

So 8.988e9 *10.26e-38 = 9.227e-28.

Divide by (2 *2)=4 → 2.30675e-28.

Multiply by 12 → 2.768e-27 J.

Hmm, which is 2.768e-27 J, which is not any of the options.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using r as 2 meters from each other, not from P. But that's not the case, as the 12 are at 2m from P.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using r=2 meters as the distance between each of the 12 charges.

In that case, each mutual pair would be separated by 2 meters, so U_ij = (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Which is (8.988e9 *10.26e-38)/2 = (9.227e-28)/2 =4.613e-28 per pair.

66 pairs → 66 *4.613e-28 =3.045e-26.

U_central is 5.536e-27.

Total U =3.045e-26 +5.536e-27 =3.598e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but looking at option A:5.645e-26 → about 5.6e-26 J.

Which is about 56e-27.

Hmm, 3.598e-26 is 35.98e-27, which is about 36e-27, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as 2 * (k_e * (2e)^2 )/(2m) for each surrounding charge. Because when you bring a charge into a potential, the work done is q times the potential at that point, which includes the contribution from all other charges.

But in this case, when bringing each charge, the potential at their position is due to the central charge and the previously placed charges.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the electric field at each charge due to the others is zero. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler, and only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 is considered. So the answer would be option C:7.056e-27 J, but I don't see how that would come about.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2.

Wait, 2e =3.204e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.26e-38 C².

Yes.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute U_central as 5.536e-27 J, and the answer isn't among the options, which suggests I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k_e, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

k_e =9e9.

Then, U_central =12 * (9e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 )/(2*2).

Compute:

9e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 =9e9 *10.26e-38=90.36e-29=9.036e-28.

Divide by 4:9.036e-28 /4=2.259e-28.

Multiply by12:2.259e-28 *12=2.711e-27 J.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using r=2 meters between each of the 12, and the central charge is fixed, so the mutual potential energy is considered as well.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is (12 choose 2) * (k_e (2e)^2)/d, where d is 2m.

So U_mutual =66 * (8.988e9 *10.26e-38)/4.

Because d=2m, so 4 m.

Wait, no, d=2m between charges? No, because each charge is at 2m from P. So the distance between two charges would be sqrt( (2)^2 + (2)^2 - 2*2*2*cos(theta) ), where theta is the angle between them as seen from P. But without knowing theta, it's impossible to compute.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual potential energy, making the answer 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe considering the potential energy as the sum of the central charge and each of the 12, but in a way that each charge contributes (k_e * (2e)^2)/(2m) multiplied by 12, which would be 12 * 4.613e-28 =5.536e-27 J.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J. That's about 28e-27 J.

If I multiply my U_central by 5, I get 27.68e-27, which is close to option B. But why would I multiply by 5?

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot that the central charge is 2e and the 12 are 2e each, so each pair contributes (2e)^2, but perhaps the central charge is considered as fixed, and the surrounding charges are each being placed into the potential created by the central charge and the other surrounding charges.

But this seems too complex for a multiple-choice question.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not exactly sure how to arrive at that number.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute U_central again.

Each U_i = (k_e * (2e)^2 )/(2m).

So:

k_e=8.988e9.

(2e)^2=10.26e-38.

r=2m.

So U_i = (8.988e9 * 10.26e-38 )/(2*2) = (9.227e-28 )/4 =2.30675e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.30675e-28 *12=2.768e-27 J.

But option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.56 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is (2e)*(2e)*k_e/(2m) multiplied by 12.

Which is (4e² k_e)/(2m) *12.

Wait, (4e² k_e)/(2m) = 2e² k_e/m.

m=2, so 2e² k_e/2 =e² k_e.

e²= (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

e² k_e=2.56e-38 * 8.988e9=2.304e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 2.304e-28 *12=2.7648e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for e, like e=1.6e-19 C, but perhaps 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

So (2e)^2=10.24e-38.

k_e * (2e)^2=8.988e9 *10.24e-38=92.03e-29=9.203e-28.

Divide by r=4 m: 9.203e-28 /4=2.30075e-28.

Multiply by12:2.30075e-28 *12=2.7609e-27 J.

Same as before.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, but none of them lead to any of the given options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Another possibility is that the problem is asking for the potential energy per charge, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, and their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's impossible because all are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as zero because the charges are arranged symmetrically, but that's not correct.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I can't figure out how to reach that exact number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system consisting of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to remain at a distance of 2 meters from a central charge fixed at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system includes contributions from two sources: 

1. **Potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges**:
   The potential energy between two charges is given by \( U = \frac{k_e q_1 q_2}{r} \), where \( k_e \) is Coulomb's constant (\( 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)), \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), the energy for one pair is:
   \[
   U_{\text{one}} = \frac{k_e (2e)^2}{2m} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(3.204 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2 \times 2}.
   \]
   Calculating this gives \( U_{\text{one}} \approx 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J} \). Since there are 12 such pairs, the total contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \times 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \approx 5.536 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges**:
   The mutual potential energy between pairs of the 12 charges depends on their arrangement. For simplicity, it is assumed that each pair is separated by a distance of 2 meters (though this is not physically possible for 12 charges on a sphere). The potential energy for one pair is:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual, one}} = \frac{k_e (2e)^2}{2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(3.204 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2}.
   \]
   This gives \( U_{\text{mutual, one}} \approx 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J} \). There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) such pairs, so the total mutual potential energy is:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = 66 \times 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \approx 3.045 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]

Adding the contributions from both sources, the total potential energy is:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central}} + U_{\text{mutual}} = 5.536 \times 10^{-27} + 3.045 \times 10^{-26} \approx 3.598 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this result. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is significantly smaller than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or a misunderstanding of the intended assumptions (e.g., neglecting mutual potential energy). Based on the options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
