Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic mechanics. But I'll give it a shot.

So the question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about that. Lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Oh wait, actually, wait, wait. The problem says "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons." So yeah, Li is element 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the problem is to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of this Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c. I think the energy they're referring to is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. So I'll need to calculate the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

First, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The speed v is 0.96c, so v²/c² would be (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: let's see, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857
