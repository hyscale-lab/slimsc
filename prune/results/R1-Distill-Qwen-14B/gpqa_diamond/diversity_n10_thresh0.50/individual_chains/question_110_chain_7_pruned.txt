Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, actually, waitâ€”brighter means lower magnitude, right? So if a star has a V magnitude less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So the limit is V mag >17? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, right, apparent magnitude is what we see from Earth. So if a star's apparent V magnitude (m_v) is brighter than 17, meaning m_v <17, then ESPRESSO can detect it. Because the scale is inverted: lower numbers are brighter.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So m_v <16. So any star with m_v less than 16 can be seen by HIRES, and any with m_v less than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. So a star that's brighter than (m_v <16) can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So, a star
