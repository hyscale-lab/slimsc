Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a meson resonance, X, and we're supposed to find its mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving a different distance in meters.

Hmm, I remember that when particles are produced, their decay depends on their lifetime. The mean decay distance is basically how far they travel before decaying. So, the formula should involve the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the mean distance L is given by the product of the lifetime (τ) and the velocity (v) times the speed of light (c), so L = vτc. Wait, no, actually, maybe it's L = cτ multiplied by the velocity. Or wait, because velocity is a fraction of c, perhaps. So maybe L = v * c * τ. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is L = c * τ. Wait, no, because τ is the proper lifetime, and if the particle is moving at velocity v, then the observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau, but wait, wait—wait, no, I'm confusing the terms here. Let me think again.

Wait, the mean lifetime is tau (τ) = hbar / Gamma, where Gamma is the decay width. Oh wait, the decay width Gamma is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. Because the uncertainty principle says that the lifetime and energy are inversely related. So yeah, τ is Planck's constant (divided by 2pi, I think) over Gamma. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, wait. The decay width Γ is the total decay rate, and the mean lifetime τ is indeed ħ / Γ. So that part is clear.

So, once I have τ, I need to find the velocity of the particle. Because the mean decay distance depends on how fast the particle is moving and how long it lives. So, the distance is L = v * t, where t is the lifetime. But wait, the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be time dilated. Oh wait, no, wait: the proper lifetime τ is measured in the particle's rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma factor. So the observed lifetime
