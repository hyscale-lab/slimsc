Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them. The question is about the orbital periods. 

The data given: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more the star is moving, right? Which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

I remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula is something like K = (v * (M_p) ) / (M_star^(1/3)) * ... wait, maybe I should look it up more precisely. Oh wait, I can't look it up, so I'll try to remember.

The formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (1 AU)) ) * (P / (2π)) )^(-1/3) ?

Wait, maybe another approach. The formula I think is derived from Kepler's third law. The velocity of the star (K) is related to the planet's orbital period (P) and the mass of the planet (M_p). 

I think the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than the Sun), that term can be approximated. Because M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, the formula simplifies.

Wait, another version I remember is that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some constants. But I'm not getting the exact form right. Maybe it's better to think about the relation between K and P.

Wait, the key point is that for the same star mass, if the Doppler shifts (K) are different, how does that affect the period?

Alternatively, think about how K relates to the orbital period for a given planet mass and star mass.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the relation between K and the period P. Let's think of K proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ), because higher P would mean lower velocity changes. Because if a planet is farther away (longer period), the star doesn't have to move as much. So, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

Wait, another approach. The RV method measures the star's velocity. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (P) ^ (-1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So,

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3 )

But wait, I'm not confident about the exponents. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but that might be missing some factors. Let me think again.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π / P) ) ] / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But again, since M_p is much less than M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can ignore that term.

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me get the exact formula. I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

No, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to think about the formula in terms of the star's velocity.

Wait, I found a resource (from my memory) that K is given by:

K = [ (2πG) / (c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But again, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ [ (2πG) / (c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But the constants are the same for both stars because they're the same mass as the Sun, and same planet mass (Neptune). So, for each planet, K1 and K2 are measured, and we can relate their periods P1 and P2.

So, since K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (some constants), and for both stars, M_p is same (Neptune), M_star same (Sun), so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, that would mean K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So, P ∝ 1 / K^(3).

But wait, let me think again. Let me write the formula for K1 and K2.

K1 = (constant) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * [ (1/(P1^(1/3)) ) ]

Similarly,

K2 = same constant * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * [ 1/(P2^(1/3)) ]

But since M_p and M_star are same for both, the ratio K1/K2 = sqrt( (P2/P1) )^{1/3} ?

Wait, no. Let's write the ratio:

K1 / K2 = [ (1 / P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (1 / P2^(1/3) ) ] 

Which simplifies to (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait, solving for P:

From K1 / K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, take both sides to the power of 3:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Therefore, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

But wait, no. Because K1 is the shift for planet 1, K2 for planet 2. So let's write:

K1 = (constant) * (1/P1^(1/3))

K2 = same constant * (1/P2^(1/3))

So, K1 / K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be larger than P1? Because higher K implies larger velocity, which implies shorter period? I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's velocity amplitude K is higher when the planet is more massive or when the orbital period is shorter. Because a planet with a shorter period would cause the star to move more quickly (like a more massive planet), but wait, wait, orbital period and velocity.

Wait, let's think about it. The planet's orbital period is the time it takes to go around the star. If it's a short period (closer orbit), the star's velocity would be higher. Because the planet is closer, so the star's velocity in the opposite direction would be higher. So a smaller period P would lead to a larger K.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be smaller than P1. Because P is inversely related to K.

Wait, but according to our earlier equation:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So if K2 > K1, then K1/K2 < 1 → (P2/P1)^(1/3) <1 → P2 < P1.

Which makes sense. So, a larger K implies a smaller period because the planet is orbiting faster.

So, back to the problem. K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1. So P2 should be smaller than P1.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 is longer than P1? Wait, no. Wait, no; because K2 is larger, P2 is smaller. So P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. Therefore, the answer would be a number less than 1, but looking at the options, the options given are A) ~ 0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So, we need to find P2/P1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, according to the equation, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So cube of that is (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = P1 * 0.364 → so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. That means the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1 by about a factor of ~0.36.

But the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? Wait, that's the ratio P2 / P1. If P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2/P1 is 0.364, so the period is shorter, not longer. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times planet #1's period, meaning it's shorter. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. That would be 0.36, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer, which is actually shorter. So the ratio is 0.36. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the ratio. Let me double-check.

We have K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, solving for P2/P1:

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

So, (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1 → P2 = 0.364 * P1.

So the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter. So the question asks how many times is P2 longer than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times longer? No, wait, that's not correct. Because 0.36 times as long. So it's 0.36 times the period of planet #1. Therefore, it's about 0.36 times as long, so it's 0.36 times longer. So the correct answer is option A, ~0.36.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2 / P_1 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. Since the question asks how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is **longer** than that of planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **A) ~0.36**: Matches the calculated value.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as it suggests planet #2's period is longer than planet #1's.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as it also suggests a longer period for planet #2.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.

The correct answer is **A**, as the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Answer: A
