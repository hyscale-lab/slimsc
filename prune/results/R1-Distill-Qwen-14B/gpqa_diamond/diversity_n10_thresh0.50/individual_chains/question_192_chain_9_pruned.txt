Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a charged spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me think. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. 

The setup is that there's a spherical conductor with radius R, and it's uncharged initially. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is at a distance s from the main conductor's center, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the main conductor's center. Oh wait, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, with l and L both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when a conductor is uncharged, charges can redistribute when another charge is placed inside. But wait, since the conductor is uncharged, any charge added inside the cavity should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh right! The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor is neutral, and the charge +q inside the cavity attracts negative charges. Then, the outer surface must have a charge +q to keep the conductor neutral overall.

But wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged. When you put +q into the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance, making the total charge of the conductor zero again. Hmm, that seems right.

Now, point P is outside the conductor. So when calculating the electric field at P, I can treat the conductor as a point charge. Because outside a spherical conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the outer surface's charge is +q, so the field at P should be as if it's a point charge q at the center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So yes, from Gauss's Law, outside the conductor, the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center, and the conductor's radius is R, but
