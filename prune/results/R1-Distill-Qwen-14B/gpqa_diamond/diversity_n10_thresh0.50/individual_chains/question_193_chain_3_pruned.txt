Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance. They've observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, so the formula they're giving is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, so like, how does N depend on r when r increases?

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx is in arcseconds and d is in parsecs. So if d increases, plx decreases.

So if I have N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let me write that down: 

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5

Simplify that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. Oh wait, no, wait: 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is 1/(1/d^5) which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So I think that means we're looking for the dependence of N on r, which is
