Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratio in two different energy bands. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions remain the same. I'm supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So the ratio is flux1/flux2.

Wait, first, let me recall what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. I remember there are different branchesâ€”like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to form a boron-5 nucleus, which then decays into two helium-3 nuclei. This process is part of the main proton-proton cycle and contributes to the production of higher-energy neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III process is a major source of neutrinos, specifically the 7Be decay which produces electron neutrinos. So stopping it would mean that the neutrinos from that process are no longer being produced. But the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still producing neutrinos. 

Wait, but neutrinos have
