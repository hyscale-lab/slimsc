Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measure the position, none are found where x is less than 1 or greater than 3. So, the particles exist only between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1, because the total probability should be 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, to find the modulus squared, I need to compute ψ times its complex conjugate. The complex conjugate of ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply them, the imaginary parts will cancel out the imaginary parts, or maybe not. Let me see.

Multiplying (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i). That should be (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)^2*(-1)^2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about how complex conjugates work. The product is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts are multiplied as -i^2.

Wait, the product is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) you get a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, I should check that. Let me compute ψ*(x) ψ(x):

ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i
ψ* = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i
Multiplying gives:
