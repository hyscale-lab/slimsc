Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. The excitation of atoms depends on temperature, right? So in thermal equilibrium, the number of atoms in a higher energy state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the temperature.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ). Since the energy levels are the same for both stars (same energy difference), the ratio of the populations should relate to the temperatures.

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So N1 (star_1) is twice N2 (star_2). Let me write that down: N1/N2 = 2. But wait, no, actually, the question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So perhaps N1 = 2 * N2, so the ratio N1/N2 = 2.

But wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), since N2 is higher energy. Oh wait, no, I think in the formula, N2 is the number in the higher energy level. So if the energy level in consideration is the higher one, then N2 is the higher energy population.

Wait, no, let's get this straight. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. So the number in E2 is N2 = N1 * (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So the ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. But I don't think the actual value matters for the equation because the options are in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but since both stars have their own temperatures, T1 for star_1 and T2 for star_2. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = N1/(N2)_star1, no, wait maybe I should think of each star's situation separately.

For star_1: The excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me think about the ratio of the populations. Let me denote for star_1: N1_high / N1_low = 2 * (N2_high / N2_low ), because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the ratios for each star. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is N1_high / N1_low = (g_high/g_low) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, N2_high / N2_low = (g_high/g_low) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2) ).

But wait, if the ratio of excitation is twice, that would mean that (N1_high / N1_low) is twice (N2_high / N2_low). Because star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state relative to the lower state as compared to star_2.

Wait, no, maybe not. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation in star_1 is higher. So the ratio N_high/N_low is higher for star_1 than for star_2.

So, star_1's ratio is twice as much as star_2's ratio. So:

(N1_high / N1_low) = 2*(N2_high / N2_low )

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, each is equal to (g_high/g_low) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So:

(g_high/g_low) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * [ (g_high/g_low) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

The g terms are the same for both stars, so they cancel out.

So we have exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange terms. Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left and the ln(2) to the left:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2 )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Wait, wait, let me double-check the signs. After moving, it's like:

-ΔE/(k T1 ) + ΔE/(k T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which is ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )= ln(2 )

So that's the same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, looking for an equation involving T1 and T2. The options are all ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Let me solve for ln(2):

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But wait, the given options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation can be rearranged in terms of the temperatures without involving ΔE, but I don't think that's possible because we don't know the value of ΔE. However, the problem gives the ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, but the options don't involve it, so perhaps we can eliminate it from the equation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me go back.

Wait, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So does N_high / N_low for star_1 equal 2 times that ratio for star_2?

Yes. So N1/N2 = 2, where N is the excited state over the lower state.

Wait, let me clarify: For each star, the ratio of excited to non-excited atoms is R = (g_high/g_low) exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Since g_high and g_low are the same for both stars (same element), the ratio R1 for star_1 is twice R2 for star_2. So:

R1 = 2 R2

Which gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So taking natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2 ) - ΔE/(k T1 ) = ln(2 )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2 )

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So ln(2) equals [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation can be expressed in terms of the ratio of temperatures or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can express it as:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/(k) )

But I don't know the value of k, but perhaps it's not needed because the question is about the form of the equation, not the actual values.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but my equation is ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But since ΔE is given, perhaps it can be expressed in terms of T1 and T2. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that ΔE/(k) is a constant that can be incorporated into the equation, but the options don't include it, so that suggests I may have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, another approach: let me think about the ratio of the two ratios. Let me consider R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

We have R1 = 2 R2.

So, R1/R2 = 2.

But R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So, ln(2) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Which is:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

So rearranged, the equation is ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But again, the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation can be rewritten as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) * (k ) / ΔE

But without knowing the values of k and ΔE, I can't compute the numerical value, but the equation requires a form where ln(2) is proportional to (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), multiplied by a constant. But the options don't have a constant term, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should have taken the ratio the other way. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, the excitation level (N_high/N_low) of star_1 is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So R1/R2 = 2.

But R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), so:

R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] + [ ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So,

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

So that's the same as before.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So comparing to my equation, which has ln(2) equals [ (ΔE/(k) ) * (T1-T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

So the options don't include the (ΔE/(k)) factor. So perhaps that factor is being ignored, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup, and it's the other way around. Maybe the ratio is N2/N1 = 2? Wait, the question states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So, if star_1 is hotter, then its ratio would be higher.

Wait, but let me think: higher temperature leads to higher excitation because the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms can be excited. So if star_1 has higher excitation (twice as much), then T1 is higher than T2.

So let's say T1 > T2. So when T increases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases because ΔE/(k T) decreases. So higher T would have a larger exponent, making the ratio higher.

Wait, but in the equation, R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so if T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, so R increases. So higher T leads to higher excitation.

So if star_1 has higher excitation (twice as much as star_2), then T1 > T2.

Now, going back to the equation.

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

But none of the options have ΔE or k, so perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some factor. But the options don't have that term, which suggests that perhaps I'm supposed to eliminate the constants.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So if my equation is ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k) ) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 ), then this would imply that (ΔE/(k) ) is 1, which isn't necessarily true. But perhaps in the problem, the actual value of ΔE/(k) is such that it can be ignored or it's a given condition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the equation in the form without ΔE, which might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let's consider the ratio of the two equations. Let me write both equations:

For star_1: N1_high / N1_low = (g_high/g_low) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: N2_high / N2_low = (g_high/g_low) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking the ratio R1/R2 = 2 = [ (g_high/g_low) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g_high/g_low) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Taking ln:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Which brings me back to the same equation. So the equation is ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k) ) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't include ΔE and k. So perhaps the correct approach is to realize that without knowing ΔE and k, the correct option would have the structure (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), assuming ΔE/(k) is a multiplicative factor that's not part of the options.

Looking at the options, option D is:

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But according to our equation, the right-hand side is (ΔE/(k)) times (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 ). So unless ΔE/(k) is 1, option D isn't correct.

Wait a minute, what is the value of ΔE/(k)? Let's compute that. The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) = 1 K.

Oh! So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [1 K ] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But the units would be K * (1/K^2) ) = 1/K, but ln(2) is dimensionless. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, no: (T1-T2) is in K, T1 and T2 are in K, so (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 ) is 1/K.

But the equation is:

ln(2) = [1 K ] * (something in 1/K )

Which would make the right-hand side unitless, which matches ln(2)'s unit.

Wait, but in the equation, when I have [ (ΔE/(k) ) (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 ), the units would be ( J/(J/K) ) * K ) / ( K^2 ) ) → K * K / K^2 → unitless. So that works.

So substituting ΔE/(k) = 1 K, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [1 K * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Because 1 K * (T1 - T2) is in K, and denominator is K^2, so overall it's (K) / (K^2) ) = 1/K. Wait, but wait, that would make the right-hand side in 1/K, but ln(2) is dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me compute (ΔE/(k)):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J
k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [ (1 K) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which is [K * (K)] / ( K^2 ) ) → (K^2) / K^2 ) = unitless, which is correct.

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which matches option D.

So the correct option is D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann distribution relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{high}}}{N_{\text{low}}} = \frac{g_{\text{high}}}{g_{\text{low}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{high}} \) and \( g_{\text{low}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{high}}}{N_{\text{low}}} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \quad \text{(star_1)},
\]
\[
\frac{N_{\text{high}}}{N_{\text{low}}} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \quad \text{(star_2)}.
\]

Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, the ratio of their excitation levels is:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\Delta E \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E \) and expressing the difference in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
\Delta E \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: Incorrect form, as it does not account for the difference in temperatures or the product \( T_1 T_2 \).
- **Option B**: Incorrect form, as it introduces an unnecessary sum of temperatures.
- **Option C**: Incorrect form, as it introduces an incorrect power of \( T_1 T_2 \).

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
