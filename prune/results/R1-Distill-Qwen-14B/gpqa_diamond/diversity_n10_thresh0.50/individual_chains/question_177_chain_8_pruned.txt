Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Their masses are also in the same ratio—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the wavelength where a star emits most strongly is related to its temperature. I remember something about blackbody radiation and Wien's Law.

Wien's Law says that the wavelength of maximum emission is inversely proportional to the temperature. So, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. So T_1 = T_2.

Now, the problem is about luminosity. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, this formula applies.

So, we're to find the ratio of L1 to L2. Let me write that down. L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). But wait, since T1 = T2, T1⁴ over T2⁴ is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would mean the factor is approximately 2.25, which is option A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.

Wait, the question mentions radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, that's about the Doppler effect. Does this affect their observed wavelengths or luminosity? Oh wait, in the problem, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. But the
