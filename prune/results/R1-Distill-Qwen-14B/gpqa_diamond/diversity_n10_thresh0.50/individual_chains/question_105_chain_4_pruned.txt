Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is being observed, the spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates. But here's the kicker: this setup can look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet (R_pl) relative to the star's radius (R_star) to produce the same brightness variation amplitude. So we're comparing the effect of the spots to a planet blocking the light.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness change when a planet transits a star is due to the planet blocking some of the star's light. The change in brightness, or the transit depth, is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But in this case, the star has spots. So the variation comes from the spots rotating in and out of view. I need to model how the spots affect the observed brightness.

The star's total brightness without spots is based on its effective temperature. When a spot is visible, it contributes less light. So the observed flux is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

Wait, the filling factor is given as 20%. Filling factor, I think, refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But how does that translate to the entire star's surface?

Wait, no, the star is a sphere. If one hemisphere is completely covered, then the spots are on half the star. But in this case, only 20% of that hemisphere is covered. So the total area of spots on the star is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Let's think about the area involved.

The area of a hemisphere is (2 π R^2). So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2. So the total spotted area is 0.4 π R_star^2.

Wait, but when the star rotates, this spotted area is only a part of the total area visible. But when the star isn't rotating, the entire hemisphere is viewed, but only 20% is spotted.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere. The observed hemisphere is the part facing us. So when the star rotates, different parts come into view. But in this scenario, only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view.

But what's the effect on the brightness? So the brightness variation amplitude depends on the change in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

Wait, but I think the problem is looking for the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same change in brightness. So the planet would block part of the
