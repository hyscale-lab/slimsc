Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know luminosity relates to how much light a star emits. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. 

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait, that might not be the case if other factors are involved. Or does it mean their temperatures are the same? Because lambda_max is directly proportional to 1/T, so same lambda_max implies same T. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the question says they used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they're the same. So the peak emission is at the same wavelength, so same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Now, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But when calculating intrinsic properties like luminosity, which is an intrinsic property, the Doppler shift shouldn't affect the actual luminosity. Because luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, but observed brightness (apparent brightness) would be affected by distance and Doppler shift. Wait, but the question says they computed the luminosity, so maybe I don't need to worry about that. Or perhaps the radial velocity is a red herring? Because if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted, but the intrinsic properties (like luminosity) are independent of that.

Wait, the question says they computed the luminosity using black body radiation. So maybe the radial velocities are given just for context, but perhaps not directly affecting the calculation of luminosity. Because luminosity depends on radius and temperature, not on how fast it's
