Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges, right?

Alright, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. All right, so each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge. e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so 2e would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is like 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2 meters around the fixed charge.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since potential energy is a state function, the total energy depends on the configuration.

But how do I calculate the potential energy here? Oh right, for point charges, the electric potential energy between two charges is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, around 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since there are multiple charges, I need to consider all the pairwise interactions. Wait, but if the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2 meters from P, then each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge.

So the total potential energy would be the sum of the energies between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, plus the potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says it's an isolated system, so maybe all the charges are contributing. I think I need to compute both parts.

First, the energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12. Since each of the 12 is at 2m, and each has 2e charge, the potential energy between the fixed charge (2e) and each of the others (2e) would be (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m).

Wait, the distance between them is 2m. So each pair contributes (k *
