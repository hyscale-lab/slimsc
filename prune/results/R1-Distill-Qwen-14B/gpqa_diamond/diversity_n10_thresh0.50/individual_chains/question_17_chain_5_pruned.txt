Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with the Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability constant is given here. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, right, the stability constant K is for the formation of the complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The stability constant K would be [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal. I think that implies that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form, so we don't have to worry about the alpha fraction here. So I can consider the concentration of EDTA as approximately [Y^4-].

So the formation equation is: Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²−. The K for this is 5e10.

In the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates a little, it produces some Ca²
