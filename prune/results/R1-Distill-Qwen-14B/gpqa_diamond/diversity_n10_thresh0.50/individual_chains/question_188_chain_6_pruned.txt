Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal as well. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and all angles alpha, beta, gamma as 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I think I need is the interplanar distance formula, which involves the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma. That should simplify the formula a bit.

So substituting alpha, beta, gamma with 30 degrees, which is 30°, so cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.866.

The Miller indices here are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging into the formula:

d_111 = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2*(1*1 * cos 30°) + 2*(1*1 * cos 30°) + 2*(1*1 * cos 30°) )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, the numerator is just a, which is 10 Angstroms.

The denominator is sqrt of the sum. Let's compute the sum inside the square root:

Sum = (1 + 1 +1) + 2*(cos 30°) + 2*(cos 30°) + 2*(cos 30°)
Wait wait, no: the terms are 2hk cos gamma, 2hl cos beta, and 2kl cos alpha. But since all are 30°, each of these terms is 2*1*1*cos30°.

So each of the three cross terms is 2*cos30°, so three cross terms would be 3*(2*
