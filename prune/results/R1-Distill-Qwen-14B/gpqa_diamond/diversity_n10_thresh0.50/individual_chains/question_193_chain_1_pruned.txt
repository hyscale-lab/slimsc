Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the terms here. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So if parallax is inversely proportional to distance, then plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5, right? Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5, and 1 over that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, because when considering a volume of space, the number of stars depends on the volume. Volume increases with the cube of the radius, but this seems to be a different situation.

Wait, the relation given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to d, 1/plx becomes d
