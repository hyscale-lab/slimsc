Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to how stable a complex is. For a metal ion M and ligand L, the stability constant for ML^n is βn, where βn = [ML^n]/([M][L]^n). So higher β means more stable.

The question mentions dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to complexes with two SCN- ligands. Wait, but the problem says "blue dithiocyanato", so probably the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But wait, I'm a bit confused about what each β corresponds to. Let's see.

Wait, the stability constants are for the complexes: CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, and Co(SCN)_4^2-? Or is it different? I think β1 is for the first complex, so Co(SCN), which would be CoSCN^+ because Co is +2 and SCN- is -1. So each βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

So the complexes are:
- β1: CoSCN^+ (n=1)
- β2: Co(SCN)_2^0? Wait, Co^2+ and 2 SCN^- would be neutral? Because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So [Co(SCN)_2] has a charge of 0.
- β3: Co(SCN)_3^- (since 2+ +3*(-1) = -1)
- β4: Co(SCN)_4^2- (2+ +4*(-1) = -2)

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato. I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)_4]^
