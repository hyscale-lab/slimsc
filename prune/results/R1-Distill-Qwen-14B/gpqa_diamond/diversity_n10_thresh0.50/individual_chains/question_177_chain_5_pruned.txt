Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that astronomers are looking at their luminosities. So, luminosity refers to the total energy a star emits per second, right? I remember that luminosity depends on a star's radius and temperature. Oh wait, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, that's the blackbody radiation law.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if mass plays a role here. The problem gives some other info about wavelengths and radial velocities, but perhaps I can focus on the luminosity part first.

They mention that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Remember Wien's Law, which states λ_max * T = constant, roughly 2.9×10^-3 m·K. So, if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So, T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the wavelength at which the stars appeared brightest is the same.
