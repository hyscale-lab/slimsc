Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The setup is a bit complex. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because it's a cavity inside the conductor.

Now, a small amount of positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges and electric fields. Since the conductor is uncharged, maybe the charges inside the cavity will induce some charges on the conductor's surfaces.

Wait, when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. So if +q is inside, the inner surface must have -q. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must then have +q to balance it out. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, right?

So the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Because the conductor itself is neutral, the net charge on it is zero, but the inner and outer surfaces have these induced charges.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. In this case, the Gaussian surface would be a sphere of radius L (since P is at L from the conductor's center). The charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface would be the total charge outside the conductor within that surface.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface (which is outside the conductor) is +q. But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, correct? Because L is the distance from the conductor's center, and L > R. So the field at P should depend on the charge outside the conductor, which is +q.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the arrangement of the charges on the outer surface would be uniform if the cavity's charge distribution allows it. Oh, but wait, the cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center. So the charge distribution inside the cavity is not symmetric. But wait, no, the conductor is a conductor, so charges on the inner surface would adjust to make the field inside the conductor zero.

Wait, the inner cavity has a charge +q. So the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge -q. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. But how does the position of the cavity's center affect this?

I think the key here is to find the electric field at a point outside the conductor. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. So if the conductor's outer surface has +q, then the field at P would be as if all that charge is concentrated at the center.

Wait, but wait. No, because the conductor is neutral overall. Wait, the conductor starts uncharged. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance, making the conductor's net charge zero. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the outer surface has +q. So for any point outside the conductor, the electric field would be as if the +q were at the center.

So the field at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. But wait, let me think again. Is there any reason the field would be different because the cavity is offset?

Oh, maybe I'm missing something. The point P is not necessarily aligned with the center of the cavity. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the centers are separated by s, with angle theta. So the setup might not be symmetric.

Wait, but when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R. So the field at P (outside) should only depend on the charge on the outer surface, regardless of where the inner charge is. Because the conductor's material ensures that the field inside is zero and the charges rearrange to make that happen.

So the outer surface's charge is +q, so the field outside would be as if that +q is at the center of the sphere. So the formula is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking back at the options, option B is that. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but why do the other options exist? Let me check each option.

Option A is (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That seems like a potential if the field was being calculated from a point charge at the cavity's center, considering the displacement. But for a spherical shell, the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center of the shell.

Option C has (l + s cosθ)^2, which doesn't make much sense in this context.

Option D is 1/(4πε₀) * q / l². That would be if the field was due to a charge at the cavity's center, but since the conductor's outer surface is what contributes to the field outside, that's not correct.

So yeah, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and the radius of the cavity is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Conductor Properties**: Since the conductor is neutral, the total charge on it is zero. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface. In this case, the Gaussian surface is a sphere of radius $L$ (since $P$ is outside the conductor). The charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface is the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$. The electric field at $P$ is therefore determined as if all the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Symmetry and Induced Charges**: The offset of the cavity's center by $s$ and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the conductor's material ensures that the charges rearrange to make the electric field inside the conductor zero, and the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests the electric field depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$. This would be relevant if the charge were located at the cavity's center, but the field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface, not the cavity's position.
   - **Option B**: This gives $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$, which correctly represents the electric field due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor at a distance $L$ from its center.
   - **Option C**: This suggests the electric field depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: This gives $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{l^2}$, which would be correct if the field were due to a charge at the cavity's center, but this is not the case.

Thus, the correct electric field at point $P$ is given by **Option B**.

Answer: B
