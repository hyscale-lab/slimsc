Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see, I need to figure out which compound E is based on the given reaction steps and hints. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

Plus, there are some hints about the structures of A and E based on their IR spectra and another reaction.

Starting with the first step: A + HCN → B. HCN is a nucleophile; it typically adds to carbonyl groups. So A is likely a ketone or aldehyde. When HCN adds to a ketone, the product is a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin of A.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably reducing the nitrile group in B to an amine. Wait, no. Wait, B has a nitrile group. Hydrogenation of nitriles (R–CN) under H2 and a catalyst like palladium would typically reduce the nitrile to an amine: R–CH2–NH2. But wait, no. Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, hydrogenation of nitriles can be done under different conditions. If it's H2 with palladium, sometimes it's a catalytic hydrogenation that might reduce the triple bond to a single bond, so CN becomes CH2NH2? Or maybe CH2NH2? Hmm, maybe I should think about what the product C would be.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the reactions. So compound B is a cyanohydrin. So its structure would be R-C(OH)-CN, where R is from compound A. When we hydrogenate this, what happens? The nitrile group will become an amine. Wait, no—nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like palladium might add hydrogen to the triple bond. So R–C≡N becomes R–CH2–NH2. But wait, the cyanohydrin has an alcohol group as well. So in B, the structure would be something like R-C(OH)-CN.

When hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the nitrile (CN) would become CH2
