Okay, let's tackle this multiple-choice question. It's about determining which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. I need to figure out which stars meet the brightness criteria of both instruments.

First, I'll read the problem statement again. So, the key points are:

- ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means apparent V magnitude ≤17, because lower numbers are brighter.

- HIRES can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag. So apparent V magnitude ≤16.

So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if it's brighter than 16, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16 <17), and HIRES can also see it.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So, stars with V ≤17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed, so V ≤16.

So a star must have V apparent mag ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is ≤16, it's within both's limits. If it's between 16 and 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't, since HIRES only goes up to 16.

So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

Now, I need to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust) which affects brightness.

Wait, looking at the stars:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. No mention of extinction (E(B-V) isn't given), so no extinction. So apparent V = absolute mag + distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d) -5. d is 10 pc, so log10(10)=1. So 5*1-5=0. So apparent = 15.5 +0 =15.5. So V=15.5. Which is ≤16. So both ESPRESSO (17 limit) and HIRES (16 limit) can detect it. Wait, but HIRES is for ≤16. So 15
