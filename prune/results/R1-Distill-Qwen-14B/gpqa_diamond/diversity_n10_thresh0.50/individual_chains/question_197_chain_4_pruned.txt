Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Then, I need to find out what the final product is from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, but since there's an O-H, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. The peaks around 1610 and 1450 are likely aromatic C=C stretching.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): This is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton. The broad singlet suggests it's not exchanging quickly, which could be a deprotonated carboxylic acid, but wait, in D2O, it might show as a singlet. Hmm, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. 

Then, 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet has 2H, so maybe two substituents in para positions. Wait, but if it's benzene with two substituents, like two substituents in the para positions, but in this case, perhaps a substituent on the benzene and a carbonyl group.

The next peaks: 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), which could be a CH near a branching or maybe a CH adjacent to an oxygen. 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), perhaps some CH2 groups. 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H). The triplet at 0.9 with 3H is likely a methyl group attached to an ethyl chain, maybe -CH2CH2CH3. The doublet at 1.4 might be a CH2 next to a branching point, like in an isobutyl group.

Putting this together, I'm thinking of a structure where there's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and another substituent which is an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, the IR also has a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, that peak could be from the carbonyl (O=C-O). Wait, but sometimes the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700-1725 cm-1, so that fits.

So the benzene ring probably has a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and another substituent. The NMR shows two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted benzene. So, if the substituents are a COOH group and another group in para positions.

Looking at the other NMR signals, 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). That seems like a chain attached to the ring. The triplet at 0.9 suggests an ethyl group, maybe a CH2CH3. The 1.4 doublet could be adjacent to a branching. So perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and another group, which is an isobutyl or sec-butyl group.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Hmm. Let's think. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group (COOH) and a sec-butyl group in the para position. That would fit the NMR data.

Looking at the NMR for a benzoic acid: the COOH proton is around 10.5 (broad), which matches. The aromatic protons would be as a doublet each for the two H's adjacent to the substituents. So in para positions, each set of aromatic H would be a doublet. That fits the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which suggests two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but wait. Benzoic acid has the COOH group. So the benzene would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C. Let me think about the structure. The substituents would be on carbons 1 and 4, but wait, numbering might be different.

But wait, the NMR data: the CH2 groups. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-C(CH3)2. So the peaks would be as follows:

The -CH2- adjacent to the benzene would be around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (maybe a methylene next to a branch). The isobutyl group would have a CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something like that.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl, which is a four-carbon chain with branching. The substituent structure would be -CH2-C(CH3)2. So the NMR for that group: the CH2 attached to the benzene would be around 2.9 ppm (maybe as a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent CH). Then, the CH(CH3)2 would be a triplet or something? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the substituent is a sec-butyl group, -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait
