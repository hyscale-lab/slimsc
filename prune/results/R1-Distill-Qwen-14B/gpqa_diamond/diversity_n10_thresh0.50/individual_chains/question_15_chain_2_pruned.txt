Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the transit method depends on the planet passing directly in front of its star from our point of view. The probability of this happening is related to the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Oh right, the formula for transit probability involves the orbital period, the star's radius, and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the main factors I think are the orbital distance (semi-major axis) and the star's radius. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is such that it's more likely to align edge-on. So the probability P is roughly (R_star / a)², where a is the semi-major axis. Or maybe it's more like (R_star / a), I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by another factor? Or is it just (R_star / a)? No, I think the actual formula is P = (R_star / a)² * (something else, maybe considering inclination). Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2 multiplied by (1 - e²)^(3/2), but since the orbits are circular here, e is zero, so that term is 1. So, it's (R*/a)^2 multiplied by something else? Or maybe I'm mixing it
