Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the given options. Let's look at each reaction one by one.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is where the product from the first reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to remember what I learned. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. The reaction with NaCN probably involves some kind of nucleophilic substitution or addition. Wait, ketones can undergo various nucleophilic attacks. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's an alkyl halide reacting, but butanone is a ketone, not an alkyl halide. Oh wait, maybe it's an enolate formation?

Wait, another thought: the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. The nitrile group is on the same carbon as a hydroxyl and a methyl group. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2C=O. So the product must have the nitrile added to the carbonyl carbon, replacing the ketone oxygen. So, that's a typical substitution reaction for a ketone, but ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution directly. Oh wait, but maybe it's in a specific condition. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition-elimination mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: Could it be a nucleophilic acyl substitution? But ketones generally don't undergo that as easily as esters or amides. Oh, or maybe it's via a Claisen or some kind of condensation? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, but let me think about the product. The product has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and a nitrile on the same carbon. So the starting ketone, (CH3)2CO, has the carbonyl. When
