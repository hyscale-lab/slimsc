Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT framework. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).

Right, SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators that parameterize beyond the SM physics. These operators are organized by their dimension, starting from dimension 6.

Now, the question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to figure out which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, what do I remember about each of these symmetries?

Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime, requiring that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. In the Standard Model and hence in SMEFT, all terms must respect this. So SMEFT operators must be Lorentz-invariant.

Poincaré symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry (spatial and temporal). Wait, but isn't Lorentz symmetry part of Poincaré? So if an operator respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect both, or just Lorentz?

Wait, another angle: the SM respects Poincaré symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, so operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM includes both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. So in SMEFT, all operators must respect both.

Wait, but when we construct the SMEFT operators, do we have to impose Poincaré symmetry? Or is it automatically maintained because the SM operators do so? Hmm, perhaps it's part of the setup. So when building SMEFT, the operators are required to be Poincaré invariant.

Wait, but wait. Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Do the SMEFT operators necessarily respect translational symmetry? Well, the operators are written as local terms in a Lorentz-invariant way, so they should automatically be invariant under translations. Because they are part of a local field theory.

So, SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. But looking at the options, the choices are 1,2, etc. The first option is Lorent
