Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are about how stable a complex is, right? The higher the constant, the more stable the complex.

The question gives me a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, right? Because dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands.

Wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue ones. I remember that in cobalt complexes, the color changes with the number of SCN- ions attached. So, the blue one is probably the +2 charge, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n) ion. Let me think about the possible complexes.

Cobalt can form various complexes with SCN-. The general formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(3-n), I think. Because Co^2+ has a +2 charge, each SCN- is -1. So for each SCN attached, the overall charge goes down by one. So:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ --> charge is +1 (since 2+ -1 = +1)
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 --> neutral
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- --> charge -1
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- --> charge -2

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], and so on.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the most stable is β3=63, which would be the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which is n
