Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the Boltzmann equation, right?

Boltzmann's equation relates the populations of two energy levels. The equation is usually written as N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Here, N2 is the population of the higher energy level, and N1 is the lower one. Wait, wait. Oh, right, E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive.

In the question, it's stated that the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So, for star_1, the population ratio (N2/N1)_1 is 2? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation is higher, meaning more in the higher energy state. So N2/N1 is 2 for star_1, and maybe 1 for star_2? Or perhaps I should look at the ratio of star_1 to star_2.

Wait, actually, the problem states that the excitation is twice as
