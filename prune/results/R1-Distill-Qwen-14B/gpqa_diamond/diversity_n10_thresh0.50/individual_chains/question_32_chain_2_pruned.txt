Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, the isotope would be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons. Lithium typically has 3 protons, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it a 6 nucleon nucleus.

I remember that relativistic energy involves gamma, the Lorentz factor. The energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = γmc². So I need to find gamma when the speed v is 0.96c.

Calculating gamma: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in v=0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which I think is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So 1/0.28 is indeed about 3.57142857. So gamma is approximately 3.571.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li is around 6.941 atomic mass units (u), but wait, Li-6 is lighter than that. Oh wait, no, Li-6 has a mass of about 6.015 atomic mass units. Because natural lithium is a mix of Li-6 and Li-7, but Li-6 is about 6.015 u.

An atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But wait, actually, I think it's easier to work in units where c is in m/s and masses are in u, but perhaps it's easier to use energy in GeV since the answer options are in GeV.

I recall that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, the rest energy mc² for Li-6 would be 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me calculate that.

6.015 * 931.5 = Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, 0.015 * 931.5 is about 13.9725. So total is approximately 5602.9725 MeV, which is about 5.6029725 GeV.

Wait, wait, let me make that precise. 6.015 * 931.5 = 6 * 931.5 + 0.015 *931.5.

6 *931.5=5589. 0.015 *931.5=13.9725. Sum is 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

So the rest energy is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by this rest energy. Gamma is approximately 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me calculate that: 3 *5.603 is 16.809,
