Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it must go to the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state? In quantum mechanics, for a diatomic molecule, the states are usually defined by the rotational and vibrational levels.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But wait, the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, which is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, that includes both rotational and vibrational energies.

So the molecule's total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational parts. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). When it absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition gives the lower energy photon absorption?

Wait, the energy difference for the vibrational transition (from v=0 to v=1) is much larger than the rotational transitions. Because vibrational energy levels are more spaced out. So if the molecule is
