Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. But wait, what do these spots do? I remember that sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun's surface, so when they cover part of the star, the total emitted light decreases, making the effective temperature lower.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, why would that happen? I think it has to do with the Saha equation, which describes the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere under LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium). The Saha equation relates the number of ions to the electron density and temperature, but here we're talking about energy levels, so it's probably more about the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels of an atom to the temperature. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. So, the energy difference between the two levels is determined by the photon's energy. The energy E of a photon is given by E = hc / λ. So higher energy differences would lead to a more temperature-dependent ratio.

The ratio n1/n2 (or maybe n2/n1, depending on which is higher) depends on the exponential term. If the temperature changes, the ratio changes. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. But wait, what about the spots themselves? Are the spots cooler, so the Ti atoms there are in different states?

Wait, the problem states that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower. So, the star is emitting less total flux because 40% of its surface is at a lower temperature. But in the photosphere—where the observations are made—what's the temperature? I think the photosphere's effective temperature is Teff. So the effective temperature is an average over the entire surface. So when the star has spots, the average Teff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K.

Wait, but the actual surface of the star without spots is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, maybe around 5000 K or so. But the question is about the photosphere's temperature. Oh, the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So for the purpose of calculating the ratio
