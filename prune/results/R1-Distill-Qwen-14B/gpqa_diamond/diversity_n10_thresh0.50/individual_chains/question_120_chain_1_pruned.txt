Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws involving 1 over plx raised to different exponents like 1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Oh right, this probably has to do with the volume of space. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

So, when we talk about a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance would be from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but that's getting into calculus, maybe integrating or differentiating.

Let me think about the volume in terms of distance. The number of stars should depend on the volume between two distances. For small ranges, the volume element could be considered as a spherical shell. The volume of a shell between distance r and r + dr is 4πr² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference would be approximately 4π r² dr for small dr.

So the number of stars in a volume element dV is proportional to dV, assuming uniform density. So N ∝ dV. But since we're looking at how the number of stars per unit parallax varies, we need to express dV in terms of parallax.

Wait, parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, let's substitute d with 1/plx. Then, the volume element dV is 4π (1/plx)² * (dplx), but wait, because dr is the change in distance, which is the derivative of distance with respect to parallax. 

Wait, let's do this properly. Let me express in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx. So, the volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. But we need to express everything in terms of plx.

So, when plx changes by dplx
