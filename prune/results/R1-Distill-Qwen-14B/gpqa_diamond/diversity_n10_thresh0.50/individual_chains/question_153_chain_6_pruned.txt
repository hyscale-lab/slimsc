Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part of the question step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt in EtOH. So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has an α,β-unsaturated ester group. So in the Michael addition, the nucleophile (the enolate from dimethyl malonate) will attack the β position of the acrylate.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Michael donor is the enolate, right? The acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So in this reaction, dimethyl malonate is the donor, and the acrylate is the acceptor. The enolate would attack the β carbon of the acrylate.

When the attack happens, the product would have the two malonate groups attached. So the product would be a new compound where the acrylate's β-carbon has the malonate's methyl groups. Let me visualize this. The acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at the 3-position being p-tolyl. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-C-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the β carbon. Wait, the structure is probably CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3?

Wait, no, maybe I should draw it. The general structure for acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-O-R. So in this case, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the β carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no, the acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent at the 3-position, which is the β carbon. So it would be CH₂=C-O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate group is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3-position refers to the substituent on the CH₂=CH- part. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(OCH3) with a p-tolyl group on the β carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for methyl acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOCH3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the β position. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. So the α and β carbons are CH₂ and CH, with the β having the p-tolyl and the COOCH3.

So when the Michael addition occurs, the nucleophile (the enolate from dimethyl malonate) attacks the β carbon, which is the CH with the p-tolyl group. So the enolate would add to the β
