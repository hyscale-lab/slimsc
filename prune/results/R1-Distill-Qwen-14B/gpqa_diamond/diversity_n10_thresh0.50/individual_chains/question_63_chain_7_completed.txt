Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, let me think about it. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy levels. 

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so that's the ground state. They're asking what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, but wait—when they say "next state with the lowest possible energy," does that refer to the next higher energy level? Or maybe the next state in a certain model? Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm a bit fuzzy on which transitions are allowed.

Wait, the model here is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think combines both rotation and vibration. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes vibration and rotation are treated separately. In the rigid rotor model, the molecule doesn't stretch, so it's purely rotational. But the non-rigid rotor allows for some vibration as well.

So maybe the molecule can absorb a photon that changes its rotational state or its vibrational state. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so I think that would imply the smallest possible energy increase. So the photon's energy needs to be just enough to move to the next state, whatever that is.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the allowed transitions.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a diatomic molecule, B is related to the moment of inertia. The first rotational state would be J=0 (ground state), then J=1, etc. So the next state might involve transitioning from J=0 to J=1. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state, v=0, and the lowest rotational state, J=0. So the next possible state would likely be either the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). Which requires less energy?

Let me think about the energies involved. The vibrational energy levels have a spacing of ħω, where ω is the angular frequency given as 4e14 rad/s. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω.

The rotational energy levels, for a rigid rotor, are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 would be E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B (1)(2) - 0 = 2B. What's B? B is ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. 

I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, r is bond length. So let's compute that. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. The reduced mass μ is (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, amu is atomic mass units, which I should convert to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let me compute that:

1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3.016, so 3.016e-27 kg. 

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m. 

I = μ r² = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that:

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I=3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is h-bar, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s². 

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ) ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, the energy difference for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B, so 2 *4.61e-23 J = 9.22e-23 J.

Now the vibrational energy difference is ħω. Let's compute that. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s, ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two: rotational transition requires ~9e-23 J, vibrational is 4e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should provide the energy for the smallest possible transition, which is the rotational one.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state could be either J=1 or v=1. But the energies required are 9.22e-23 J and 4.218e-20 J respectively. So the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon needs to supply about 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but wait a second. The fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either J=1 or v=1. But the problem states "the next state with the lowest possible energy," which I think means the smallest energy jump. So the photon's energy should match the smallest possible energy difference, which is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

But the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Wait, photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E/(c). c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Wait, that's a very small momentum. But looking at the options, the given options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N s. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations. Maybe I messed up the moment of inertia.

Wait, let's recompute μ. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2)= (40)/(22) = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. So that's correct.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstrom = 2e-10 m. I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m². Correct.

B = ħ²/(2I). Let me compute ħ² again. 1.05457e-34^2 is approximately 1.112e-68. Divided by 2I=2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J, correct.

So the rotational energy needed is 2B= ~9.22e-23 J. That's correct.

So E_photon = 9.22e-23 J. Then p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Wait, but none of the options are around 1e-31. The options are 1e-27 to 1e-28 N s. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the next state in the rotation-vibration model, which combines both. Oh, perhaps it's a vibration-rotation transition. So the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next allowed state is v=0, J=1? Or v=1, J=0? Alternatively, maybe it's a combination.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels incorporate both rotational and vibrational aspects. So the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So transitions can be from (v, J) to higher (v', J').

But the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next available state, which could be either J=1, v=0, or v=1, J=0. So we need to find which transition requires less energy.

In that case, we have to compute the energy differences for both possibilities and choose the smallest.

So, compute ΔE for v=0→v=1 (with J=0), and ΔE for J=0→J=1 (with v=0). Compare the two.

ΔE_vibrational = h ν = h*(ω/(2π)) ), but wait, no, because ω is given as angular frequency, so the energy is ħω as before, which is about 4.2e-20 J.

ΔE_rotational is 2B, which is about 9.22e-23 J. So the rotational transition is lower in energy. Therefore, the photon should supply 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. So maybe the energy levels are different. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational states, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the model considers the molecule's vibration and rotation together, so the energy levels are a combination of both. So the energy levels are E = B J (J+1) + (something for vibration). Hmm, but I'm not very clear on that. Maybe the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state.

Assuming that, the next possible state would be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Since the rotational transition's energy is lower, the photon should provide that.

So, the photon's energy is E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is E/c. Let's compute that.

E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, they are in N·s, which is kg·m/s. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Hmm, my calculation gives 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s. Which is way smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the rotational transition. Maybe the initial state is J=0, and the next state is J=1, so the energy difference is 2B (from J=0 to J=1: E_rot increases by B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B).

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is that 2B, but that's correct. Wait, maybe I was wrong in the model. Perhaps the model allows for transitions where both J increases and v increases, but that's the next higher energy level.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the next state in the rotational model, not including vibrational transitions. But then the photon's momentum would be ~3e-31 Ns, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

B = ħ²/(2I)

I = μ r² = ( (20*2)/(22) ) * (1.66e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, wait, the reduced mass μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) in amu. So 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu, as before.

So I = μ r² = (1.818 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculate μ in kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

r² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Compute B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact number more accurately.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Compute 1.05457e-34 squared:

(1.05457)^2 ≈ 1.1122.

So 1.1122e-68. Then divide by 2.4128e-46.

So 1.1122e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = (1.1122 / 2.4128) ) * 1e-22.

1.1122 / 2.4128 ≈ 0.461.

So 0.461e-22 = 4.61e-23 J. So B is correct.

So 2B is about 9.22e-23 J, correct.

But the momentum is 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the model combines both rotational and vibrational energies, and the transition is a simultaneous change in both. So the photon's energy would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But that would make the energy even higher.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the first overtone—no, probably not. The question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy' so it should be the smallest ΔE.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy. Maybe I miscalculated that.

Vibrational energy ΔE = h ν, where ν is frequency. Since ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, the frequency ν is ω/(2π).

So ν = 4e14 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ (4e14)/(6.2832) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So h ν = 6.626e-34 J s * 6.366e13 Hz = approximately 6.626e-34 *6.366e13.

Let me compute that: 6.626 *6.366 ≈ 42.32.

So 42.32e-34 +13 = 42.32e-21 = 4.232e-20 J, which matches my earlier calculation. So that part is correct.

Hmm, so the rotational energy needed is 9.22e-23 J, which is about 10 times less than the vibrational energy. So the rotational transition is the lower one.

But the options don't have anything close to 1e-31 Ns. So I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider only the vibrational transition because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is a higher state than the fundamental, but perhaps the fundamental includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first excited state, which could be J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0. So the energy difference is the lower of the two.

Which is lower? The rotational transition is lower, so the photon should have energy 2B =9.22e-23 J.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the model. Maybe the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which includes vibrational motion, so the energy levels are different.

Wait, in a non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, so the moment of inertia isn't fixed. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels. Maybe the vibrational energy affects the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model we should use is the rigid rotor for rotation and the quantum harmonic oscillator for vibration, treating them separately. In that case, the transitions are either vibrational or rotational.

So the next state is either v=1 (E= ħω) or J=1 (E=2B). Since 2B is smaller, the photon's energy is 2B.

So the momentum is p = E/c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns. But the given options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check all the unit conversions again.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Masses:

Mx =20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My =2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

Wait, no, wait: 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg. My is 2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27)/(3.32e-26 +3.32e-27).

Wait, no: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx =20 amu, My=2.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) ) amu =40/22 amu =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

So μ in kg is 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg = approx 3.016e-27 kg. Correct.

Then I = μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m². Correct.

B is ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 *1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46 )= 4.61e-23 J. Correct.

Wait, so E_photon is 9.22e-23 J.

But the options are in the range of 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is about 10^5 times larger than what I'm getting. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Because the options are way larger, and the vibrational energy is 4.2e-20 J, which would mean p= (4.2e-20) / (3e8) =1.4e-28 kg m/s = 1.4e-28 Ns. That's option D.

But why would the rotational transition's momentum be so small compared to the vibrational? Because the vibrational energy is much higher, so the photon's momentum is higher.

But earlier I thought the rotational transition is lower in energy, but perhaps I'm missing something about the model. Maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which implies that it's a non-rigid rotor, meaning that the bond length can change, and rotational and vibrational energies are considered together.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels of the non-rigid rotor include both rotational and vibrational contributions. So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=0, J=1, or v=1, J=0. But perhaps in this model, the energy levels are such that the first possible transition is a vibrational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model treats the rotational and vibrational energies as part of the same spectrum, and the next state is a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about the vibrational transition. Because the options correspond to the vibrational energy.

Wait, let's compute the momentum for the vibrational transition. E_photon = ħω = (1.05457e-34 J s)(4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E/c =4.218e-20 J /3e8 m/s =1.406e-28 kg m/s =1.406e-28 Ns. That's very close to option D, which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the correct approach here is to consider the vibrational transition, not the rotational. But why?

Wait, perhaps because in the non-rigid rotor model, the transition that is allowed is a simultaneous change in both vibration and rotation, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could be an increase in vibration. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational state, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state, regardless of rotation.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) along with the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. But the vibrational transition requires more energy, so why would the photon be of that energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats the system as a harmonic oscillator with rotational fine structure, but the next state is a vibrational state. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternative approach: check the options. The closest match to my vibrational calculation is option D, 1.4e-28 Ns. The rotational calculation gave me 3e-31, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational energy.

But why? Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0. The next state is v=1, requiring a photon of energy ħω.

So maybe the correct answer is D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But I'm a bit confused because the rotational transition requires less energy. But perhaps in the context of the non-rigid rotor model, the allowed transition is a vibrational one, not a rotational. Or perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibration, not rotation.

Alternatively, maybe I was supposed to compute the rotational transition but messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me think again: the problem asks for the photon's momentum to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should be the smallest possible to cause a transition. So the smallest ΔE is the rotational one, so the photon's energy is 2B. So the momentum is 2B/c.

But as I calculated earlier, that's 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibration state and the next rotational state. Or perhaps the model treats the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, and the first transition is vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in a different way.

Wait, another thought: the question says the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor. So perhaps the rotational energy isn't given by B J (J+1), but by another formula that includes vibrational terms. Maybe the moment of inertia isn't fixed, and the rotational energy is different.

Wait, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E(J, v) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J), where E_vib is the vibrational energy and E_rot is the rotational energy. So the transitions can involve both changes in J and v, but the next state with the lowest energy is the one where either J increases or v increases, whichever requires less energy.

Given that, the rotational transition to J=1 requires 2B, and the vibrational transition to v=1 requires ħω. So which is smaller?

Earlier, I found 2B =9.22e-23 J, and ħω=4.2e-20 J. So the rotational is smaller. So why isn't the momentum 3e-31 Ns?

Unless the problem isn't considering rotational transitions, perhaps because it's a non-rigid rotor, which allows for some vibration, but transitions are not allowed in pure rotation. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering vibrational transitions, but that doesn't make sense. The question mentions the rotation-vibration model, so it should consider both.

Wait, perhaps the fundamental state isn't just v=0, J=0. Maybe the fundamental state in the non-rigid rotor model is a state where both J and v are at their minimum, but the next state isn't necessarily either J=1 or v=1. Maybe it's a combination, but I don't know the formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are given by a combination of both, and the next state with the lowest energy is the combination (v=1, J=0), which would have energy E = E_vib(1) + E_rot(0) = ħω.

Wait, that would mean the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J, which leads to p_photon=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier, the rotational transition requires less energy, so why wouldn't that be the case?

Unless in this model, the rotational transitions aren't allowed, or are higher in energy than the vibrational.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, double-check B calculation.

I = μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20=1.2064e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68)/(2.4128e-46) = approx 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.22e-23 J, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia as just r^2 * (m1 m2)/(m1 + m2), which is correct. So that part is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The only option that matches the vibrational energy is D. But according to the calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational one. So why isn't that an option?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule switching to the next energy state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational transitions, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering vibrational transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking for the options:

Option D: 1.4e-28 N*s.

Which matches the vibrational momentum.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational energy, and the answer is D. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the molecule's vibrational energy, and the rotational part is a distractor.

Wait, the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor. So the energy levels would incorporate both rotation and vibration.

In this model, the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state would be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0), whichever has lower energy.

Wait, but E_rot(J=1) = B*1*(1+1) = 2B. E_vib(v=1) = ħω.

So which is smaller: 2B or ħω?

Compute 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

Compute ħω =4.2e-20 J.

So 2B is smaller. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon of energy 2B.

But the momentum for that is 9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Hmm. So perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition and only considering vibrational. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of B. Let's recompute it step by step.

Compute I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) amu =40/22=20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg =3.016e-27 kg.

r=2 angstrom=2e-10 m.

I =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 =1.112e-68 J² s².

2I=2.4128e-46 kg m².

So B=1.112e-68 /2.4128e-46 = approx 4.61e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So the photon's energy is 2B=9.22e-23 J.

p=9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the next vibrational state, not the next in energy. Because perhaps the rotational energy levels are higher in this model.

Wait, but 2B is 9.2e-23 J, which is way less than ħω of 4.2e-20 J.

So why isn't that the correct approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the model isn't the rigid rotor but the non-rigid, which has a different formula for rotational energy. But I don't remember the exact formula for non-rigid rotor energy levels.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the molecule's transition to the next higher energy state in the rotation-vibration model, which is the first overtone, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition because the rotational transitions require higher wavelengths, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the moment of inertia more carefully. Oh wait, perhaps the bond length is given as R=2 angstroms, but in the non-rigid model, the bond length varies, but for the ground state, it's at equilibrium length. So perhaps the calculation of I is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is taking the rotational constant B as 4.61e-23 J, but perhaps the energy transition is actually 2B * (something else). But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational energy but only the vibrational. So the photon's energy is ħω=4.2e-20 J, which gives p_photon=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Because it's a non-rigid model, perhaps the rotational transitions are not allowed, or perhaps the question is only about the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is ambiguous, and the intended correct answer is D.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is D.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the question asks for the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The key parameters provided are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:

1. **Fundamental State and Next State**:  
   The fundamental state corresponds to \( v = 0 \) (lowest vibrational state) and \( J = 0 \) (lowest rotational state). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a rotational transition (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)) or a vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)). The photon's energy must match the smallest energy difference between these transitions.

2. **Rotational Energy Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) is the rotational constant. The moment of inertia \( I \) is calculated as:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2, \quad \text{where } \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]
   Substituting \( R = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   I = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]
   The rotational constant \( B \) is:
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The energy difference for the transition \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega \). Substituting \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Comparison of Energy Differences**:  
   The rotational transition requires less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)). Thus, the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

5. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \):
   \[
   p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
   \]
   However, none of the provided options match this value.

6. **Revisiting the Options**:  
   The closest match to the vibrational transition is option D (\( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)), which corresponds to the vibrational energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \). Calculating the momentum for the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
   \]
   This matches option D.

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy, but the options provided suggest that the problem is focusing on the vibrational transition. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
