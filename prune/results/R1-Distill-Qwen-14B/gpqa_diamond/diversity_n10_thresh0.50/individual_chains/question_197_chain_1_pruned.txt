Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Wait, no, wait. Another thought: HI with red phosphorus... Oh right, I think that's used in the hydrolysis of alkyl chlorides, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with a nitrile group. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI are also involved in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines? Or maybe it's the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing reactions.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Oh right! The reaction is called the Stephen reduction or maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. No, wait, no. Another approach: when a nitrile (R-C≡N) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it gets hydrolyzed to an amine. Alternatively, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an alkyne? No, I think nitriles are more likely.

So Compound X has IR and NMR data. Let's look at that.

The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region is probably an -OH stretch, but wait, maybe an O-H in a carboxylic acid? Or maybe an alcohol? Or maybe an amine? Alternatively, that could be N-H in an amide or something. Alternatively, the 3400–2500 cm-1 might be a C-H stretch, but that's usually for alkenes or alkynes. Hmm, wait, another thought: 3400-2500 could be an O-H or N-H stretch. The presence of a peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches, maybe indicating para-substituted rings. So putting that together, the compound probably
