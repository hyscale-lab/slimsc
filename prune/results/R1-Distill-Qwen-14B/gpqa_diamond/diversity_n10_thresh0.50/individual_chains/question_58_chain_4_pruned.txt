Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math blow up. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting finite results.

So, I think QED is a theory where regularization is needed. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, especially the electron self-energy or the photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. For example, the Coulomb potential in QED without regularization would be a problem, right? Oh wait, but actually, QED is a renormalizable theory. So they use the process of renormalization, which involves absorbing the infinities by redefining parameters like charge and mass. But before renormalization, you still need to regularize the integrals to make them manageable. So QED does require regularization. So option C probably isn't the correct answer.

Then there's Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes weakly interacting due to asymptotic freedom. Wait, but what about the mathematics? QCD has a different beta function compared to QED. The beta function for QCD is negative, which means the coupling decreases at high energies. But does that mean it doesn't require regularization? I don't think so. Because like QED, QCD calculations can have divergent loop integrals. So you would still need regularization techniques, maybe like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So B) QCD probably needs regularization too.

What about Superstring Theory? Superstrings are a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. String theories aim to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. From what I remember, string theories have a different approach to dealing with divergences. In string theory, instead of point particles, you have strings, which might help in avoiding some of the divergences because the interactions
