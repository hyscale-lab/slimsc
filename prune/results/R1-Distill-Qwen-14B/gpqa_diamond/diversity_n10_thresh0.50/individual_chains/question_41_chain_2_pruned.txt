Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm... Right, I remember that when light moves through a medium, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

The setup is that a glass with index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The glass is moving toward the observer. The question is asking for the speed of the light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I think this involves special relativity because velocities are being added, but I'm not entirely sure. Because the glass is moving, but the light is in the glass, which already has a different speed than in a vacuum. So, how do these two factors combine?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but that's when things are moving in the same direction. But wait, in this case, the light is inside a medium, so its speed is c/n, right? Because the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n.

So the light's speed in the glass is u = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v. So what's the observed speed of the light from the lab frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The glass is
