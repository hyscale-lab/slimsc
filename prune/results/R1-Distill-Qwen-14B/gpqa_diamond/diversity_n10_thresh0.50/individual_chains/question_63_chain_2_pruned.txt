Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled with the rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that will cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state must be the first excited state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational levels. Oh right, the energy levels are given by the combination of vibrational and rotational states.

So, the molecule is initially in the ground state for both rotation and vibration. To switch to the next lowest state, the photon must provide enough energy to transition to the next possible state. But wait, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which one is the next lowest in energy?

Vibrational energy levels are quantized as well. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. Similarly, rotational energy levels are E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), with J being the rotational quantum number.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be either increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or J by 1 (v=0, J=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the vibrational energy gap is usually larger
