Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually tell us how stable a complex is, right? Higher β means the complex is more stable.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Oh wait, the blue ones are the dithiocyanato complexes. Which one is that? I think for Co(II), the common complexes include [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]^2-, and [Co(SCN)4]^2-. The dithiocyanato would be the one with two SCN- ions, so that's [Co(SCN)2]. But wait, maybe it's a different one. Or perhaps the dithiocyanato is a different complex, but I'm not sure. Oh, wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato," so I think that refers to [Co(SCN)2]^2+ because that
