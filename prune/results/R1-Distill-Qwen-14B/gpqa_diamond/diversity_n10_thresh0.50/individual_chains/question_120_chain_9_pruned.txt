Alright, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, okay, let me think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star from us. Oh right, the formula is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So if we consider a region of space, the number of stars in it doesn't depend on where you are in that region. But wait, in three-dimensional space, uniform distribution would imply that stars are spread out equally in all directions with the same number per volume.

But how does this relate to the number of stars per unit parallax? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so as parallax increases (plx up), the distance decreases (d down). So stars with larger parallax are closer.

If stars are uniformly distributed, then the number density n is constant. The number of stars in a given volume would be n multiplied by the volume. But wait, the volume at a certain distance depends on how we're looking at it. Since we're considering parallax, maybe we need to think in terms of spherical shells at a particular distance.

Let's model this. Imagine we have a thin spherical shell at a distance d from Earth. The thickness of the shell would be a small change in distance, say dd. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dd. The number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dd, because the volume is 4πd² dd and the density is n.

But since parallax plx is 1/d, we can rewrite d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)² (d d). Wait, but d is 1/plx, so dd would be - (1/plx²) d plx, but maybe that's complicating things more than needed.

Alternatively, express the number of stars as a function of plx. Let's say we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). The volume between these two distances is the difference in the volumes of two spheres.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πd³. So the volume between d and d + dd is approximately 4πd² dd. But wait, here d is a function of plx. So, let's express the volume in terms of plx.

Compute the volume between plx and plx + dplx.

The distance at plx is d = 1/plx. The distance at plx + dplx is d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Let me approximate dd as the change in d when plx changes by dplx.

Using calculus, dd = derivative of d with respect to plx multiplied by dplx. So dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd
