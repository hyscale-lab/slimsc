Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. So, the question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, we'll see brightness variations as the spots come into and out of view. But the kicker is that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. Now, the question is, if the star didn't have these spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness dip (amplitude) in the light curve?

Hmm. So, the key here is to compare the change in brightness caused by the spots to that caused by a planet. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. But wait, that's when the planet covers part of the star's surface. But here, the spots are causing a dip as well. So I need to model both scenarios and set their dip amplitudes equal.

Wait, but wait. The star's brightness change due to the spots is different than the planet's. Because the spots are cooler, when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. So when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the brightness decreases. The dip depth depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

Let me think. The star's total brightness (luminosity) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when some of the star's surface is cooler, the observed flux changes.

The spots have a filling factor, which is the fraction of the surface they cover. Here, the filling factor is 20%, or 0.2. Each spot is at a temperature of Teff - 1000K, which is 5000K.

So, the change in brightness when the spots are on the visible side depends on how much less flux they emit compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, but since only one hemisphere is spotted, the maximum effect occurs when that hemisphere is fully visible. Wait no, because the star is a sphere, but we're seeing one hemisphere. So, if the spots are on the front hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But when the star is viewed from the side, perhaps we see a larger area. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the spots are on a single face, so that as the star rotates, the spots come into view.

Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots". So, when the star is facing us, we see one hemisphere. If the spots are on that hemisphere, then when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, no. Actually, the star's surface is a sphere, so when viewed from Earth, we can see up to one hemisphere (since the other is blocked). So if the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, we might see varying amounts of the spotted area.

But perhaps the problem is simplifying it. Let me read again: "As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation." So, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, then not. So the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface. Hmm, so perhaps the area of the spots is 0.2 times the star's surface area.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the visible surface that's covered by spots. Because when the star is viewed from Earth, only half the surface is visible. So if the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum area we can see is half the star's surface. So the filling factor being 20% would mean
