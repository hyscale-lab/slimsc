Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that its operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which of the given symmetries are mandatory for all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). I need to pick which combination is correct.

Wait, what do I know about these symmetries? Let me think. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations, so it's a larger symmetry group. Oh right, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The SM respects Poincare symmetry, so does SMEFT.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. But wait, the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes like in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT shouldn't require operators to conserve CP either. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning they don't have to respect it. So option 3 might not be a must.

CPT symmetry is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. I think that's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including the SMEFT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So going back to the options. Let me list what each symmetry requires:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected. All operators should be Lorentz scalars. So yes.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Since it includes Lorentz and translations, but SMEFT is a effective theory, so all operators should be Poincare invariant. Yes.

3. CP Symmetry: Not necessarily. Operators can violate CP, so they don't have to respect it. So option 3 is out.

4. CPT Symmetry: Must be respected. All operators must be CPT-invariant.

So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Now looking at the options:

Option C says 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2 only, which excludes CPT. So the correct option must include 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. If an operator respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected, the statement "respect Poincare" implies they must also respect Lorentz. So the question is, is it that they have to respect both, or is Poincare encompassing Lorentz?

But looking at the options, option C includes both 1 and 2. So the right answer should include 1,2,4.

So the answer should be option C: 1,2,4. Which is option C. Looking at the options, option C is '1,2,4' meaning all three are required.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry involves invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since SMEFT is an effective theory of the Standard Model, it must respect Lorentz symmetry, as the Standard Model itself is Lorentz-invariant. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translational invariance. As SMEFT is derived from the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Since Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, the requirement for Poincaré symmetry implies the requirement for Lorentz symmetry as well.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed in processes like the CKM matrix. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, and CP violation can occur in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry involves the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and this symmetry is fundamental in quantum field theory. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as operators in SMEFT can violate CP.

The correct combination of symmetries is given by option **C) 1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
