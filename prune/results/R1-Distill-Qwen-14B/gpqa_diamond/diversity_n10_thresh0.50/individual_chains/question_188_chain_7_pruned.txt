Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances, but let's think it through. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral system is one of the seven crystal systems, right? And in this case, all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distanceâ€”oh, wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along one of the lattice vectors. So that's the 'a' parameter in a cubic system, but here it's a rhombohedral, so the lattice vectors may not be orthogonal.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) multiplied by some factors involving the angles between the lattice vectors. Oh wait, in a cubic system, the formula is simpler because angles are 90 degrees, but rhombohedral has all angles equal, so maybe the formula is a bit different.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of ( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 - 2 h k (a b cos gamma) - 2 k l (b c cos alpha) - 2 l h
