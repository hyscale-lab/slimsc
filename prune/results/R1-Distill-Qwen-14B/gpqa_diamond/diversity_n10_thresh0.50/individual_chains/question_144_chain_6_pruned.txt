Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. 

The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. I think I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. 

Wait, the mean decay distance, also called the decay length, depends on how long the particle lives and how fast it's moving. So, the formula should be something like L = v * gamma * c tau, where tau is the mean lifetime, gamma is the Lorentz factor, and v is the velocity. 

But wait, gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, right? Gamma equals E / (m c squared), but since E and m are given in GeV, maybe the units will cancel out. 

The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau is ħ / Γ. But since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert units properly. 

Let me jot down the steps: 

1. Find the mean lifetime tau = ħ / Γ.
2. Calculate gamma (Lorentz factor) as E / (m c²). But wait, E is the production energy, which might be the total energy. So, E = gamma m c². So gamma is E / (m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV, maybe the c² will take care of unit conversions. Wait, but c is in m/s, so I have to be careful with units.

Hmm, perhaps I should express ħ and c in compatible units. Let me think about natural units where c=1 and ħ=197 MeV fm (since 197.33 MeV·fm is approximately ħc). Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. 

So, step by step:

First, compute the mean lifetime tau:

Tau (τ) = ħ / Γ. Since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV
