Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a star with some specific parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two different energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels depends on the temperature and other factors. Oh right, this is about the Boltzmann equation and how it applies to the ionization and excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere.

Let me read the problem again. So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the effective temperature decrease? Oh, because dark spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they emit less radiation. When spots cover part of the surface, the total luminosity is less, leading to a lower effective temperature as measured from afar.

Now, the key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I think that's relevant because the ionization and excitation of Ti might be influenced by the radiation at that wavelength.

In the stellar photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two levels is given by (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So, the ratio depends on temperature. When the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower—5500 K instead of 6000 K. Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is unaffected? Or does the overall photospheric temperature refer to the average? I think the problem says that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So the effective temperature is lower, which implies that the average temperature of the photosphere is lower.

Wait, but in reality, the spots are cooler regions, so the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. But when you calculate the effective temperature, it's like an average. But for the purpose of this problem, the photospheric effective temperature after spots is 5500 K. So I think we're to treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. Or perhaps the star's overall photosphere is at 5500 K. Hmm, not entirely sure, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I
