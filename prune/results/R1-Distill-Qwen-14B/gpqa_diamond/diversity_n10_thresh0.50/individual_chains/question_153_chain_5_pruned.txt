Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion. Let's break down each part of the question step by step.

The question has three different reactions, and I need to figure out their products based on the given options. Let's take each reaction one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A.

Wait, what's dimethyl malonate? Oh right, it's (CH3COO)2CH. It's a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. NaOEt is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3 in the trans configuration. So the attack will happen at the beta carbon (the one next to the carbonyl), adding the malonate's enolate to it.

So, when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, the addition would occur to the acrylate. So after the addition, the product would have a new carbon-carbon bond. Let me think about the structure.

The acrylate has a p-tolyl group at the end. The attack would add the malonate across the double bond. So the product would have the malonate's CH2 groups attached to the acrylate's carbons.

Wait, but the acrylate is CH2=CH-p-tolyl, attached to COOCH3. No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH- but substituted at the 3 position with p-tolyl. So, it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or is it CH2-CH2 with a substituent?

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally
