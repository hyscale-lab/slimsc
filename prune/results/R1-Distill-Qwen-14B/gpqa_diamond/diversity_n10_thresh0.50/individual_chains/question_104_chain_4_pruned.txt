Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. 

Astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars with the same mass as the Sun. They found one planet each, both similar to Neptune in mass. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The detection method is the Radial Velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us. 

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I think the key here is the relationship between the RV signal and the planet's orbital parameters. The RV shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected, their orbits must be inclined enough, but I think we can assume that the inclination is the same for both or that it's not a factor here. 

Wait, but both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like). Oh, right, because the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on several factors. 

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) / (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) ) / ( (P * (1 year in seconds))^(1/3) ) * (1 / (c * sqrt(1 - e²)))

Wait, maybe another approach. I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies. Also, since M_p << M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_p/M_star is negligible. So the formula for K simplifies. 

The simplified version is something like K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1, so that term is about 1. So K ≈ (some constant) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, actually, the formula I remember is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 pi / P) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) / (c * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so the denominator is 1. And if M_p << M_star, M_star +
