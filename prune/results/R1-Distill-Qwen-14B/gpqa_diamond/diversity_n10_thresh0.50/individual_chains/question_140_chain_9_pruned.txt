Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0 degrees Celsius. So B might be a solid at room temperature but melts just above freezing. 

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So X is probably something like a strong nucleophile or a good reducing agent. Hmm.

Wait, the question is asking about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X. So I need to figure out what X is, identify its constituent elements, and then sum their atomic masses for the lightest and heaviest.

Let me think about possible reactions. So substance X reacts with Y to give gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it gives B. Also, gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about gases with equal protons and neutrons in their molecules. 

Possible gases: Maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 neutrons (12 from C, 16*2=32, but wait, no. Wait, CO2 is C:6 protons, O:8 each. So each CO2 molecule would have (6 + 8*2) protons. That's 22 protons. Neutrons would be (6 neutrons in C? Wait, carbon has several isotopes. Oh wait, the question says gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule must have equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, another possibility: H2O. Each molecule has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 +8=10, total neutrons: 8. Not equal. So H2O is out.

What about CH4? Protons:
