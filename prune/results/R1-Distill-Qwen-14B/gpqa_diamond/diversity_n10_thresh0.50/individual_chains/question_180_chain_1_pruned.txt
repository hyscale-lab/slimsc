Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, let me read it again.

Alright, so there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh, wait, and their mass is negligible. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate it and see which one matches.

Right, I remember that when you have multiple charges, the potential energy between them depends on their arrangement. Since all charges are the same, they'll either repel each other or attract. Wait, 2e is positive, assuming e is the elementary charge. So all are positive. So they repel each other.

The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 other charges are each 2 meters away from P, which is where the 13th charge is. Hmm, so each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Are they all at the same point 2 meters from P, or are they placed on a sphere of radius 2m around P?

Probably, since it's a point P and the others are constrained at 2m, they could be anywhere on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m. But for potential energy, maybe the arrangement doesn't matter because potential energy between each pair is
