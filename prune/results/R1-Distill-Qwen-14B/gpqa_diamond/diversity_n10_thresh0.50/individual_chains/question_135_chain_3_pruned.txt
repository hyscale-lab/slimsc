Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, the boson's mass is 6 GeV, and I need to figure out what particles it can decay into. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a particle decays, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the original particle. Otherwise, the decay wouldn't be possible because you can't create mass from nothing. So the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, and I need to find which fermion pairs are possible.

Looking at the Lagrangian given: L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this. Oh right, the interaction term seems to involve the boson X coupling to fermions. The structure looks like a Yukawa coupling, which is a common way for bosons to interact with fermions. So the fermions that X can decay into must be the ones that are part of this interaction. That probably means the fermions are the ones listed in the Lagrangian, but wait, the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So, in this term, the fermions ψf would be the ones that X couples to. So X can decay into any of them, provided energy allows.

But wait, in the problem, the specific fermions may be determined by the structure of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has ψf, so perhaps ψf represents all the fermions that X can interact with. So the decay products must be among these fermions.

Wait, the problem doesn't explicitly list the fermions, so I might need to assume that the fermions are the standard model ones. But the options include various possibilities. So, the possible decay products are pairs of fermions that X can interact with, and their combined mass must be less than X's mass, 6 GeV.

So, let's list the possible fermion pairs and their masses. Let me think of the fermion masses:

- e (electron): ~0.511 MeV
- mu+: ~105.7 MeV
- tau+: ~1.78 GeV
- u: ~2.2 MeV (but in some cases, the up quark
