Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. From what I remember, an eigenvalue equation is when the operator acting on a function gives a scalar multiple of that function. So, Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h over 4π. And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, let me write that down.

So, Ay = c * S. Let me compute c first. c is h/(4π). So, substituting S into Ay:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, that's the matrix form. So, the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Let's proceed.

Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. So, I'll set up the matrix Ay - a I.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a       (-i h/(4π)) 
  (i h/(4π))  -a      ]

The determinant is [ (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) )(i h/(4π) ) ] = 0.

Calculating the determinant:

a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

Wait, let's compute the product of the off-diagonal elements. The top right is -i (h/(4π)), and the bottom left is i (h/(4π)).

So, (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Because i squared is -1. So, the product is (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So, the determinant equation becomes:

a² - (h²/(16 π
