Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain operations like rotations and reflections that leave the molecule looking the same. C3h symmetry, if I'm not wrong, refers to a point group that includes a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. 

Wait, point groups... right. The C3h group is one of the axial groups, I think. So a molecule with C3h symmetry would have a threefold axis of rotation, and also a horizontal mirror plane that bisects the molecule. Alternatively, it could have a horizontal mirror plane and maybe some other symmetry elements as well.

The question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

Let me think about each molecule one by one.

First, triisopropyl borate. Its structure is like B with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are like CH(CH3)2. So the molecule is B with three identical substituents. If all three substituents are the same, maybe it has
