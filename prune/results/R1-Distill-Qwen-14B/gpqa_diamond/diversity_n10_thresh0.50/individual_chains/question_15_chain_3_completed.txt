Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which one has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

The question says the researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets have the same minimum mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, both have circular orbits. The stars are interesting: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit depends on the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star. The formula I vaguely remember is that the probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by some factor involving the orbital distance. Or was it (R_p + R_s) over something? Maybe I should think about the formula more carefully.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_p / a) * (1 + sqrt( (M_star + M_planet)/(M_star) )) )^-1. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate this as (R_p / a) * (1 / sqrt(M_star)) )^-1. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is related to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size, but I'm not quite getting the exact formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability is roughly (R_p / a) multiplied by something else. Let me think again. Oh wait, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, but also depends on the orbital distance a. Because the planet needs to be in the right orbital plane for us to see the transit. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on, but the exact probability also depends on the size of the star relative to the orbital distance.

I remember the formula as P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by some function of the inclination. Hmm, maybe another approach. Another formula I've heard is that the probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Because, if the planet is much farther than the star's radius, the chance of alignment is much lower. So, the probability is higher when a (the semi-major axis) is smaller. Because a smaller a means the planet's orbit is more likely to pass in front from our viewpoint.

So, given that, a planet with a smaller orbital period (Planet_1) would be closer to its star, because orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M_star + M_planet) * P^2)/(4π²). But since M_planet << M_star, we can approximate a^3 ≈ (G M_star P^2)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Wait, both planets have the same minimum mass, but the question says both have the same mass? No, wait the question says, "Both of these planets have the same masses." So M_p1 = M_p2.

Wait, the question states: "both have the same masses". So mass of the planet is same for both. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. And the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2.

So, using Kepler's third law, a^3 ∝ (M_star) * P^2. So for Planet_1: a1^3 = (M1 * P1^2) / (4π² G), and for Planet_2: a2^3 = (M2 * P2^2) / (4π² G).

Given that P1 = P2 /3, and M1 = 2*M2.

So a1^3 = (2*M2) * ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) / ( ... ), a2^3 = (M2) * (P2^2) ) / (... )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = [2 * (1/9) ] = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.222, which is about 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

Wait, but the transit probability depends on a. Since a is smaller for Planet_1, the probability should be higher, right? Because the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight.

But wait, the star's radius comes into play. The transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is that the probability is roughly (R_p + R_s) / a, but that doesn't sound quite right. Alternatively, the transit probability is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the probability is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (sqrt(1 - e²)) / (a (1 + m_p/M_s)^(1/3) ), but since e is zero (circular orbits) and m_p is negligible, it simplifies to P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a)) * something else.

Wait, maybe another way. The transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / (a))² * (R_s / a)^-1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), because a is the distance, so the probability increases when a is smaller relative to R_s.

Wait, here's a more precise formula I found in my notes: The transit probability for a given planet is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a ) ), assuming that the orbital inclination is random. So P ≈ R_p² R_s / (R_s² a) ) = R_p²/(R_s a). Or wait, no: Let me write it again. Perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s) ), because the more a is smaller than R_s, the higher the probability.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the probability is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) ) / (a), but that seems more complicated. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I've read that the probability is roughly (R_p/(R_s))² multiplied by (R_s/(a)), because the chance increases with closer distance. So, the formula would be P = (R_p² / R_s²) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p²/(R_s a).

Wait, that makes sense dimensionally. Because R_p is in meters, R_s in meters, a in meters. So (R_p/R_s)^2 is dimensionless, and R_s/a is 1/(a/R_s). So, P would be proportional to (R_p²) / (R_s a).

So, P = (R_p²) / (R_s a).

Wait, but in the question, both planets have the same mass, but their radii aren't given. Oh wait, the question states that the host stars have the same radius. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

But wait, the question says, "the host stars have the same radii." So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So, if the stars are the same size, R_s is same for both. So, P is proportional to R_p²/(a).

But wait, the question doesn't specify the planet radii. Oh wait, wait! The question says, "two Earth-like planets." So assuming they have the same radius as Earth, R_p is same for both. Because Earth-like implies similar size. So R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

So, P1 is proportional to R_p²/(a1) and P2 is proportional to R_p²/(a2). So the ratio P1/P2 = (R_p²/a1)/(R_p²/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Because P is inversely proportional to a, so lower a gives higher probability.

Earlier, I found that a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So a1 = 0.6 a2. So the ratio a2/a1 is approximately 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666... So P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.666.

Which means P1 is about 1.66 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but earlier I thought a1 is about 0.6 a2. So, a1 is smaller, so a2 is larger. So P1 is proportional to 1/a1, which would be higher than P2, which is proportional to 1/a2.

So, if a1 is 0.6 a2, then 1/a1 is 1/(0.6 a2) = 1.666/(a2). So P1 = (R_p² / (R_s a1 )) = same proportionality as before.

So, the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options suggest that either Planet_1 or Planet_2 is preferred. So the options are:

A) Planet_2 preferred, ~2.25x higher.

B) Planet_2, ~1.5x.

C) Planet_1, ~1.65x.

D) Planet_1, ~2.7x.

So according to our calculation, P1/P2 is ~1.666, so about 1.65 times higher for Planet_1. So option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Earlier, we found that a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P1^2) ), and P1 is P2/3. Wait, no, the Kepler equation is a^3 = (G(M* + m_p) P^2)/(4π²). Since m_p << M*, a^3 ≈ (G M* P^2)/(4π²).

So a1^3 = (G * (2 M_s) ) * (P1^2 ) / (4π² )

a2^3 = (G * M_s) * (P2^2 ) / (4π² )

Since P1 = P2 / 3, so P1^2 = P2² / 9.

So a1^3 = 2 M_s * ( P2² /9 ) * G/(4π² )

a2^3 = M_s * P2² * G/(4π² )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 * (1/9)) / 1 = 2/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 => a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 0.222, which is approximately 0.6.

So a1 is 0.6 a2, which makes a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666 a1.

Wait, no, the ratio a1/a2 is 0.6, so a2 = a1 * (1/0.6) ≈ 1.666 a1. So a2 is about 1.666 times larger than a1.

So, since P is proportional to 1/a, and a1 is smaller, P1 is (1/a1) and P2 is (1/a2). So P1 = 1/a1, P2 = 1/(1.666 a1) = 0.6/a1. So P1 is about 1.666 times P2. So P1 is 1.66 times higher.

So that's about 1.65 times, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait. Another factor is the size of the planet relative to the star. But both planets are Earth-like, so same radius, I think. So R_p is same for both.

Wait, no, the question doesn't state that the planets have the same radius. It says they're Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are similar, but not necessarily the same. Hmm.

Wait, the question states: "two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2." So same mass, same radius? Or just same mass? Because same mass doesn't imply same radius, especially if they have different densities. But Earth-like usually implies similar radius, but perhaps the question is considering same radius.

But in any case, the question doesn't give specific values for planet radii, so I think the assumption is they're the same.

So, the transit probability is higher for Planet_1, so the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Wait, the options are:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

So according to our calculation, it's 1.65 times, which is option C. So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

Here:
- \(R_p\) is the planet's radius,
- \(R_s\) is the star's radius,
- \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance.

### Key Information:
1. Both planets are Earth-like, meaning \(R_p\) is the same for both.
2. The host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)).
3. Planet_1 has an orbital period (\(P_1\)) that is three times shorter than Planet_2 (\(P_2\)).
4. The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the star's mass \(M_s\) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(a_1^3 \propto 2M_2 \cdot (P_2/3)^2 = 2M_2 \cdot P_2^2 / 9\)
- \(a_2^3 \propto M_2 \cdot P_2^2\)

Taking the ratio:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot P_2^2 / 9}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the orbital distance (\(P \propto 1/a\)). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.6a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting. Among the options, the closest match is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
