Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called 'A' to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with 'B' (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Options are given as A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different reagents.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanone is a ketone, so reacting with CN- (from NaCN) would typically be a nucleophilic addition. In ketones, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, what's the product here? The product has a hydroxyl group, a methyl, and a nitrile group. Oh wait, let me write out the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- nucleophile. So the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, opening the ketone to form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound with a hydroxyl and a nitrile group added to the carbonyl carbon.

So the product should be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The formula would be CH2(COH)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, no, butanenitrile has four carbons. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Let me number the carbons: the carbonyl is on C2. So adding CN to C2 would give:

(CH3)2C(OH)CN? So the structure is CH2(C(OH)(CN))CH3, but wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me
