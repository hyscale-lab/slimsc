Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. But when it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, when looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), they observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. Okay, so let's break this down. The key here is understanding how the ratio of populations in two energy levels changes with temperature. The problem mentions that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which makes me think of the Boltzmann equation for population ratios.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of particles in energy levels 2 and 1 respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to when there are no spots (6000 K). Let's think about how the ratio n2/n1 changes with temperature.

The ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. So, if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Because when T is higher, (E2 - E1)/(k T) is smaller, so the exponential factor is larger, leading to a higher n2/n1.

But wait, the transition between the two levels is at a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Let me calculate the energy difference between the two levels. Because that will give me (E2 - E1), which is necessary for the equation.

The energy E of a photon is given by E = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So E = hc/λ. Let's compute E. Let me remember the constants:

h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10^-10 m

Calculating E:
E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)
Let me compute that. 

First, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, but that's the energy of a photon at that wavelength. So each photon has this energy. But wait, in the Boltzmann factor, we're considering the energy difference between the two levels, which is E2 - E1. But in the equation, it's (E2 - E1)/(k T), and we can write that as (E)/(k T), where E is the photon energy corresponding to the transition.

So, the energy per photon is 1.373e-18 J. But I need to convert that into units compatible with k, which is in J/(K·mol) or J/(K·particle)? Wait, no. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, E/(k T) would be (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T).

Let me compute that for T = 6000 K and T = 5500 K.

First, when T = 6000 K:
E/(k T) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 * 6000)
Calculate denominator: 1.38e-23 * 6e3 = 8.28e-20
So E/(k
