Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charge. Oh right, particles and electric potential energy, I think.

So, the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? Which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2e, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C each. But the mass is negligible, so maybe we don't have to worry about kinetic energy contributions or anything like that.

Then, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Hmm, wait, but if the 13th is fixed at P, then the positions of the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 is 2 meters away from the 13th charge.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of this system. So, I think this relates to the potential energy in an electric system. So, the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, the system is isolated, so we're considering the total electrostatic potential energy. Because in an isolated system, the potential energy is a measure of the work done to assemble the charges, considering their interactions.

I remember that the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

In this case, each pair between the 13th charge and one of the 12 others would contribute to the total energy. Also, the 12 charges might have interactions between themselves, but wait, the question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. So, their positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, that complicates things because if they are each 2 meters away from P, but perhaps arranged in a way that's symmetrical, maybe on a sphere around P. But if they are identical charges, putting them all at 2 meters from P would all be repelling each other. So, their mutual repulsions would contribute to the potential energy as well.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy." Hmm. So, potential energy in such systems can be positive or negative. Since all the charges are positive (since each is 2e), the potential energy due to each pair of charges would be positive because like charges repel. So, the total potential energy would be the sum of all the individual pair potentials.

But wait, maybe the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, but their arrangement among themselves isn't specified. So, perhaps the minimal energy would come from arranging them in such a way that their mutual potential energies are minimized. But wait, since all the 12 are positive, maybe the
