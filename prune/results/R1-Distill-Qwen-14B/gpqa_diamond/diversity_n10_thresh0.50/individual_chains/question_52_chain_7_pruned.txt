Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is about a star whose surface temperature decreases when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% is spotted, it drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases, and I need to find by what factor the ratio changes between when there are no spots and when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature and their energy difference. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and k is Boltzmann's constant. So the ratio depends exponentially on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. So the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor would be the effective temperature of the star. But wait, wait a minute. Are the spots cooler or hotter than the surrounding photosphere? Oh right, spots are darker because they are cooler. So when spots cover part of the surface, the overall Teff of the star decreases because a larger area is at a lower temperature.

But in this problem, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So the relevant temperature for the photosphere as a whole is 5500 K in that case.

Wait, but wait again. The star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature when there are spots. The unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature. But the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So in the case when there are spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K
