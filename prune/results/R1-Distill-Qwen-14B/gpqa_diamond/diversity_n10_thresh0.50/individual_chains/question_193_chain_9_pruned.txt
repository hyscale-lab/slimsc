Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down.

So, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So plx = 1/distance, or something like that. Wait, actually, I think it's plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1 over the distance in parsecs. So if a star is 10 parsecs away, its parallax is 0.1 arcseconds. Right.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So I think that means the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since parallax is related to distance, I should express N in terms of distance. Let's denote distance as d. Since plx = 1/d (if I'm not mistaken), then d = 1/plx. So substituting that into N, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Wait, that's 1 divided by (1/d)^5. Which is the same as 1 * d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But it says per unit range of distance. Oh, so like, for each small interval dr, how does the number of stars in that interval change with r?

Wait, I think I need to think about this in terms of how many stars are in a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr. Because the number of stars might depend on the volume, which depends on distance cubed, but wait, here it's a different relation.

Let me clarify. Normally, the number of stars you can see is related to the volume of the sphere up to distance d. The volume is (4/3)πd³, so the number of stars N is proportional to d³. But here, the relation is different because the question says N varies as 1/plx^5. So let's see.

We can model this. Let me see: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But
