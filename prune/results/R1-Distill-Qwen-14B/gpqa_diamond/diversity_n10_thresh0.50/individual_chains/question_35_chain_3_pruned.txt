Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So I need to find the a's and the corresponding φ's.

First, let's write down matrix Ay. Since Ay = c·S, and c = h/(4π), I can write Ay = (h/4π) * S. Matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So substituting c:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a, -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) ]^2. Let's compute that.

Determinant = a² - [ (i h)/(4π) ]^2. Wait, i squared is -1, so [i]^2 = -1.

So [ (i h)/(4π) ]^2 = (i^2 h²)/(16 π²) )= (-1 h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant becomes a² - [ (-h²) / (16 π²) ) ] = a² + (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So, a² = - (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± sqrt( -h²/(16 π²) ) → sqrt is i h/(4π). Wait, but that's imaginary. Hmm, so the eigenvalues are purely imaginary?

Wait a second, angular momentum operators usually have eigenvalues with units of ħ. Oh wait, in this
