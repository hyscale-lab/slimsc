Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator, which is given as a 2x2 matrix.

First, let me parse the problem. The operator Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π). The matrix S is given as the first row (0 -i) and the second row (i 0). Hmm, wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix, which is often denoted as σy. So S is σy, and Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and are used to represent spin-1/2 particles. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. Wait, but let me think again. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each of them squares to the identity matrix. So σy^2 = I. So the eigenvalues of σy would be ±1, right?

So if Ay is c times σy, then the eigenvalues of Ay should be c times the eigenvalues of σy. Since σy has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay should have eigenvalues c*(1) and c*(-1). Let me compute c: c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) and -(h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any that directly match this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be purely real or imaginary? Let me think. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, a spin operator component, and for spin-1/2, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 for each component. Oh, wait! Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Hold on, I think I confused the operator. Let me think again. The intrinsic angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle is usually represented as ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So for example, S_y = ħ/2 * σy. But in this problem, Ay is given as c * S, with c = h/(4π). Wait,
