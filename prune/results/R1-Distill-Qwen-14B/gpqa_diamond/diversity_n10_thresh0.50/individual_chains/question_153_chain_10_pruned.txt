Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the Michael reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question gives three different reactions and asks for the products A, B, C. There are options, so I need to figure out each reaction and match the products.

First, let's understand what a Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion, and it attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The first reaction is: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. So the conditions are basic because NaOEt is a strong base, I think. Dimethyl malonate is an enolate donor. The acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CHCOOCH3, but wait, the substituents are on the beta position. Let me think. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl group is on the CH2=CH part. So it's CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the CH2 group. Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but arranged in such a way that the double bond is between the first and second carbon, with the p-tolyl group on the second carbon.

Wait, the name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the formula would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3
