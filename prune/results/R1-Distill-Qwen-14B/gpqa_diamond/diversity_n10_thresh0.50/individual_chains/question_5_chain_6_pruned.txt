Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says that the operator is P, which is a vector operator. So, it's got components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, so the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle phi is zero since it's in the x-z plane. So the direction is (θ, 0) in spherical terms. 

The operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator along n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So, P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So when we project P onto n, it's P_n = (P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z), because n_y is zero.

Wait, no, more accurately, the operator along direction n is P · n_hat. So,

P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n becomes n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So,

P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Now, each of P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) times a matrix. Let me write down the matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]].

P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]].

So, substituting these into P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute the matrix elements inside:

The (1,1) element is (sinθ*0 + cosθ*1) → cosθ.

The (1,2) element is (sinθ*1 + cosθ*0) → sinθ.

The (2,1) element is the same as (1,2) because the matrices are symmetric, so sinθ.

The (2,2) element is (sinθ*0 + cosθ*(-1)) → -cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by ħ/2, so each element is (ħ/2) times the corresponding element.

Now, the problem states that we need the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/
