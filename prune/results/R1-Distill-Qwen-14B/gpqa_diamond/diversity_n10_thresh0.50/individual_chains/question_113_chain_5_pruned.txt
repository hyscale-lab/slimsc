Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, especially in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have very strong and broad O-H stretches. Also, there's a peak at 1700 and another at 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring, like conjugated carbonyl groups or something like that. Wait, 1650 might also be an amide, but that's not one of the options here. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester where the carbonyl is conjugated with something else, causing the peak to shift a bit.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including some for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group. So maybe the structure has a conjugated system, perhaps with both a carbonyl and a double bond. For example, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments would give that. The molecular ion or some fragment breaking off to give a mass of 45. Let me calculate possible fragments. 45 is a familiar mass. Let's see, the molecular formula options are either C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16) = 72 +10 +32= 114. Hmm, but wait, the fragment is at 45. What possible fragments could give 45? Let me see. 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think of possible compounds. Maybe a fragment with (CH3COO-) which is 45? Because CH3COO- has a molecular weight of 45 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 = 24+3+32=59? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, CH3COO is C2H3O2. Molecular weight: (2*12)+(3*1)+(2*16)=24+3+32=59. Oh wait, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe it's something else. 45 is the same as C3H7O, but that's 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=59.
