Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, giving a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, ignoring any that exchange with deuterated solvent.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let me think about the initial compound: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a polycyclic structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo means two bromine atoms are attached to adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Heating with KOH (a strong base) suggests an elimination reaction. Wait, when dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation, leading to alkenes. But adamantane is already a rigid structure, so maybe this is a debromination followed by rearrangement or elimination.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon heating with KOH. Oh, right! I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) are treated with a strong base, they usually form alkenes via elimination. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal. So maybe it's something else. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form cyclopropane? Or maybe elimination leads to a different structure.

Alternatively, KOH could cause a double elimination, but since it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's a double elimination to form something else. Wait, another thought: in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent on the structure, so perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, forming an
