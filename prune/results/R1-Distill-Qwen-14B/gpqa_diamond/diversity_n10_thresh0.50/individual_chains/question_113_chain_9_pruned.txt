Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which formula fits the spectral clues.

Alright, the data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's take each piece one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually suggest O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. A very broad peak could mean a strong hydrogen bonding, possibly in something like a carboxylic acid or maybe a phenol. But wait, the other peaks: 1700 and 1650. The 1700 cm-1 region is indicative of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but perhaps a conjugated one or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution, like an aromatic ester or something else.

So, combining the IR data: a broad peak at 3000 (O-H?), and two strong peaks around 1700 and 1650 (two carbonyl groups maybe? Or one strong and another like an aromatic ring). Wait, but 1650 could also be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching). Oh, but if it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, that might absorb around 1650. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl group with some conjugation.

Wait, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the molecule has a double bond. So probably, the structure has a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would explain the 1650 cm-1 peak as the conjugated double bond (the C=C) stretching. Because in such a case, the carbonyl is at 1700, and the conjugated double bond (which is more like an alkene) would be around 1650.

So, putting that together, we have a molecule with a carbonyl group (
