Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but let's think this through step by step.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when dealing with conductors, charges can redistribute themselves. Since the conductor is uncharged initially and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's response is key here. 

Wait, conductors in electrostatic equilibrium have charges on the surfaces. But when there's a cavity, things get a bit tricky. Oh right, the concept of shielding! Charges inside a cavity affect the inner surface of the conductor, but the outer surface remains neutral if the conductor itself was initially neutral. 

So when +q is placed inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor, the conductor's inner surface will develop an induced charge. The inner surface of the conductor will have a charge of -q, right? Because the conductor must remain neutral as a whole. Wait no, wait. The conductor was uncharged before, so the total charge must remain zero. So the inner surface must have +q or -q? Hmm. Let me think. The charge +q inside the cavity attracts the opposite charge to the inner surface. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface would then have +q, but wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is zero. No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral. When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the +q charge attracts negative charges. So the inner surface has -q, and since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface
