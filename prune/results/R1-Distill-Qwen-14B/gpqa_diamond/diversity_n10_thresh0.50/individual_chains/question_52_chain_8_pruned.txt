Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases, and we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels depends on the temperature. This must be related to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. But wait, the spots are dark, so they're cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Does that mean the temperature of the entire photosphere changes, or just parts of it? The question says the overall Teff decreases, so I think the average temperature is lower.

Wait, but the problem says when the star's surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. But how does that affect the temperature of the photosphere? Because the spots are cooler, the overall emission is less. But the photosphere's effective temperature is an average; the actual temperature structure might be more complex. But the problem states to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which I think means that each part of the photosphere can be treated as if it's at a local temperature, and the radiation is a sum of the contributions from different regions.

Wait, no, the problem says when the star has spots,
