Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about molecules having C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. From what I recall, C3h is a point group in molecular symmetry. The 'C3' part refers to a threefold rotation axis, and the 'h' stands for a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must have a threefold rotation and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Let me think about each molecule one by one.

Starting with option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think it's a norbornane derivative but with a pyrrolidine ring. Wait, norbornane has a bridge structure. Quinuclidine has a structure where it's a seven-membered ring, but with a bridged structure. Wait, no, I think it's a bicyclic structure with two bridgeheads. Does it have a threefold axis? I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that quinuclidine has an inversion center, but I'm not certain about its symmetry. Let me think again. Quinuclidine's structure is such that it's a secondary amine, and the molecule is a bicyclic compound with a bridge. Maybe its symmetry is lower than C3h.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. The structure of triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. Isopropyl groups are bulky. The molecule should have a central boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. The central B atom would be the point of symmetry. So, if each isopropyl group is symmetric, then rotating the molecule 120 degrees around the B atom (the central axis) should leave it looking the same. So that would be a threefold rotation, which is C3. Now, for C3h, there needs to be a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. Do triisopropyl borate have such a plane?

Wait, the molecule has three identical isopropyl groups around B. So when looking along the C3 axis (from B), each group is at 120 degrees apart. So the mirror plane would be in the plane perpendicular to the C3 axis and passing through one of the substituents. For instance, imagine a plane that slices through the boron and one isopropyl group. Since all three substituents are the same, this should be a symmetry element. So triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry. So that's option C.

But wait, I've got to make sure. So triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3B, which is a trigonal planar arrangement around B. So it has a threefold rotation axis (C3). The mirror planes would be in the planes that include the C3 axis and each pair of substituents. Wait, no. The mirror planes for C3h should be a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the different types of symmetry. Let me think again.

In the point group C3h, the symmetry elements include a C3 axis and a σh mirror plane perpendicular to it. So the molecule needs to have a threefold rotation and at least one horizontal mirror plane.

In triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is identical. So when you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. Now, for the mirror plane: if you imagine a plane that cuts through the boron and one of the substituents (like one isopropyl group), that would be a vertical plane, not horizontal. Wait, no, the horizontal plane is a plane that is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So the C3 axis is, say, along the z-axis. A horizontal mirror plane would be, for example, the xy-plane.

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize. The molecule has three identical groups arranged symmetrically around the B atom. So the B is at the center, and the three i-Pr groups are at 120 degrees apart in a trigonal planar arrangement. So, if the C3 axis is pointing up (z-axis), then any mirror plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis would have to be in the x-y plane. But wait, the mirror planes in C3h are a horizontal mirror that passes through the central atom, perhaps? Or maybe through the plane of the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, so the molecule lies in a plane that is the σh plane. Wait, that can't be right because the substituents are arranged around the central atom in a trigonal planar fashion, which is not planar. So the mirror plane would have to be a horizontal one, like cutting through the B atom and being perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on to the other options and see if any of them are more likely.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. The name suggests a trifuran system, which is a tricyclic structure with three furan rings. The numbering suggests substituents at certain positions. But I'm not sure how symmetric that structure is.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a molecule with a central ring surrounded by substituents. For C3h symmetry, the substituents should be arranged symmetrically in a way that allows for threefold rotation and a mirror plane.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Similar structure to option A but with a benzo ring instead of triphenylene. Again, the substituents are arranged in a way that might have some symmetry, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Option D: quinuclidine. Let me try to visualize its structure. Quinuclidine has a bicyclic structure with two bridgeheads. The molecule is a secondary amine, so the nitrogen is part of the ring. The structure is such that it's a norbornane-like structure with an amine. The molecule has a three-membered bridge, but I'm not sure about the symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a center of inversion, so maybe it's in the Ci point group, not C3h. Because Ci doesn't have a C3 axis, so that would mean D is not the correct option.

So back to the options. Triisopropyl borate (option C) seems like a good candidate because it's symmetric with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around the central atom. Let me think again about the symmetry elements. The molecule has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which would make it C3h.

Wait, but for the mirror plane to be horizontal, it should be perpendicular to the C3 axis. So if the C3 axis is along the vertical (z-axis), the mirror plane would be in the x-y plane. But in triisopropyl borate, the molecule is flat around the boron? No, each isopropyl group is a three-carbon group, extending in different directions. So perhaps the mirror plane is not in the x-y plane but perpendicular to the C3 axis, cutting through one of the substituents.

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure of triisopropyl borate. The boron is at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. The arrangement is trigonal planar around boron. So any plane that includes the boron and one isopropyl group would act as a mirror plane. But that's a vertical mirror plane (like the y-z plane), not the horizontal (x-y) plane. So perhaps the molecule doesn't have a σh plane but has σv planes. That would mean the point group is D3h, but wait, no, D3h includes C3, σh, and other elements.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the possible point groups. The presence of a C3 axis plus a horizontal mirror plane would make the point group C3h. Alternatively, if there are multiple mirror planes, it might be higher.

Wait, another way: C3h is a point group that is non-crystallographic. It's like a trigonal pyramid with a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, the molecule could have a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror. For a planar molecule, maybe like benzene with three substituents arranged symmetrically. But triisopropyl borate isn't planar, but it's trigonal pyramidal, but each isopropyl group is a three-dimensional structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct molecule is option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The name suggests a trifuran system, which is three fused furan rings. The substituents are at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13. Wait, maybe the structure is such that it has three substituents in a symmetric arrangement, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option B is benzo-trifuran. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, maybe each of the three rings is connected in a triangular fashion, leading to C3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on visualizing these structures. Let's think about the options again.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. If it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h. But I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror. Another thought: the isopropyl groups are all the same and arranged symmetrically. So when you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Now, if you also have a mirror plane that runs perpendicular to the C3 axis (horizontal), then the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a planar molecule, so the horizontal mirror plane is less likely. So perhaps the mirror is vertical, but that would make it a different point group, like D3h or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry?

Quinuclidine, I think, is a molecule that has a center of inversion, so its point group is Ci. So D is not the correct answer.

Triisopropyl borate: I think it's a trigonal planar molecule with a threefold axis, and perhaps a horizontal mirror plane. So it would be C3h. So option C is the answer.

Wait, but I thought that in the case of triisopropyl borate, the mirror planes would be vertical, not horizontal. For example, each isopropyl group is a mirror image, so you have three vertical mirror planes. That would make the point group D3h. Wait, but D3h has more symmetry elements than C3h. So perhaps triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, not C3h.

Wait, but wait. D3h has a C3 axis, three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule has all those elements, then it's D3h.

Wait, but if the molecule only has a C3 axis and a single horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h.

So which is it?

Hmm, triisopropyl borate. Since all three isopropyl groups are identical, the molecule should have a threefold rotation axis (C3) and three vertical mirror planes (each passing through a B–C bond and the opposite substituent). So that would make the point group D3h, not C3h. Because D3h has the C3, the three vertical mirrors, and the horizontal mirror.

So if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it doesn't fit the C3h point group. So maybe option C is not the answer.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the other options.

Looking at option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

The name suggests a trifuran nucleus with three substituents from the triphenylene group. Trifuran is three fused furan rings. The triphenylene would be a substituent attached at certain positions. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric pattern, perhaps providing a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, another approach: think about the molecular formulas. The question gives the options as molecules, so perhaps looking for the compound that has threefold symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the molecule has three substituents (from triphenylene) attached to the trifuran system in a symmetric fashion, giving it C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, another way: the C3h point group has a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would have a threefold axis and a mirror plane that is perpendicular to it.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... So probably, the triphenylene group is attached to the trifuran in a way that each substituent is at 120 degrees apart around the molecule. So the substituents could be arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, creating a threefold rotation. If the molecule also has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A. But I'm not very confident.

Wait, another thought: the molecule in option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So it's a trifuran with a benzo substituent. But the substituent is added in a way that might not provide the necessary symmetry for C3h.

Option D is quinuclidine, which I think is Ci.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, another way: look for the molecule that has a threefold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. Triphenyleno substituents would have three identical groups attached symmetrically.

Wait, if the substituents are in a trigonal arrangement, then a threefold axis exists. And a horizontal mirror plane would cut through the center, making the molecule symmetric across that plane.

So perhaps option A's structure has symmetry elements that make it C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, with three substituents equally spaced, then it would have C3h symmetry.

But I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which of these molecules is a known example of C3h symmetry.

Wait, I recall that triphenylene derivatives can have certain symmetries. For example, if the substituents are placed at the corners of a triangle around a central ring, that could give C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it has the triphenylene group attached in a way that creates threefold symmetry.

Alternatively, another angle: looking for a molecule that's a derivative of a tricyclic system with three substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the point group C3h is less common than other groups like C2h or D3h. So perhaps only one of these molecules would fit.

Wait, going back to the options, option A is labeled as triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

The 'trifuran' part implies three fused furan rings, which forms a tricyclic structure. The 'triphenylene' group is likely attached at three positions, each 120 degrees apart, leading to threefold symmetry.

If each substituent from triphenylene is attached at each of three equivalent positions on the trifuran ring, that would give the molecule a threefold rotation axis. If there's also a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis, then it would have C3h symmetry.

So, putting it all together, option A is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on the defining characteristics of the **C₃h** point group. This group features a threefold rotation axis (**C₃**) and a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**) perpendicular to the **C₃** axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a trifuran system (three fused furan rings) with a triphenylene substituent. The triphenylene group is attached at three equivalent positions, creating a symmetric arrangement. This arrangement provides a **C₃** axis due to the threefold rotational symmetry. Additionally, the molecule has a **σh** plane perpendicular to the **C₃** axis, satisfying the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry.  

2. **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule is also a trifuran system but with a benzo substituent. While it has some symmetry, the benzo group introduces asymmetry in the arrangement of substituents. This disrupts the threefold rotational symmetry and the presence of a horizontal mirror plane, making it inconsistent with **C₃h** symmetry.

3. **Option C: triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement. This provides a **C₃** axis due to the threefold rotational symmetry. However, the molecule lacks a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**) perpendicular to the **C₃** axis. Instead, it has vertical mirror planes, which would place it in the **D₃h** point group, not **C₃h**.  

4. **Option D: quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridged structure. It has a center of inversion, which places it in the **Ci** point group. This symmetry is lower than **C₃h**, as it lacks both a **C₃** axis and a **σh** plane.

### Conclusion:
The molecule in **Option A** exhibits **C₃h** symmetry due to the presence of a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. The other options fail to meet the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry for the reasons outlined above.

**Answer: A**
