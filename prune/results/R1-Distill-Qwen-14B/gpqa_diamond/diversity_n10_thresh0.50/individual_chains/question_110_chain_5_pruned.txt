Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem. The question gives me five stars, each with different parameters: RA, DEC, absolute or apparent V magnitude, distance, and some have extinction values (E(B-V)). The task is to determine which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

The key points from the question are:

- ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, V < 17.
- HIRES can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 16. So, V < 16.

Wait, no, wait. Because the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, which means stars with V magnitudes below 17 are observable. Similarly for HIRES, stars with V <16.5 can be detected.

Wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star's apparent V magnitude is less than 17, it can be detected by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V <16.

So, to be detected by both, a star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16 because that's the stricter condition (since 16 is less than 17). So any star that has apparent V <16 can be seen by both.

But wait, some of the stars have absolute magnitude, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitude based on distance. Oh, and some stars have extinction, which affects their apparent magnitude. Oh right, extinction (dust) makes stars appear dimmer (higher apparent magnitude). So I have to account for that.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5.
- Distance is 10 pc.
So apparent V magnitude (mv) is Mv + 5 log10(d/10) => 15.5 +5 log(10/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.
But wait, no extinction is mentioned for Star1. So mv=15.5.
So for ESPRESSO: 15
