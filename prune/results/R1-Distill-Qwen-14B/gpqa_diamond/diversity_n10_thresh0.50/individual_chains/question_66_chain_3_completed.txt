Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries must be respected by all operators in it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct ones that all operators in SMEFT must obey.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that encapsulates all possible higher-dimensional operators that can be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, respecting certain symmetries. These operators are classified by their dimension, and they're organized in a systematic way.

I think the key here is understanding which symmetries are part of the underlying framework that SMEFT is built upon. SMEFT is supposed to be a valid effective theory up to some energy scale, and it must respect the symmetries that the Standard Model respects, right?

So, the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which is the combination of rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but isn't Poincare symmetry a larger symmetry that includes both? So if the theory respects Poincare, it necessarily respects Lorentz, but the other way around isn't always true.

But wait, in SMEFT, I think that the operators must form a consistent effective theory that is Lorentz invariant. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz symmetric, and SMEFT is an extension, all operators should respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1, Lorentz Symmetry, is definitely required.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But in an effective theory, sometimes you might have operators that don't have the same translation symmetry because they could be non-renormalizable. But wait, SMEFT is constructed in a way that it's Lorentz invariant, but does it require Poincare symmetry?

Wait, the Standard Model includes Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT, being an effective theory built from the SM, should also respect Poincare. Because all the operators in SMEFT are built from the SM fields, which already have Poincare symmetry, the operators must also have it. So I think both Lorentz and Poincare are required. So that's options 1 and 2.

Now, the other options: CP and CPT symmetry. I remember that the Standard Model is not CP symmetric because of the CKM mechanism leading to CP violation. So the SM doesn't respect CP. Therefore, SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must.

What about CPT symmetry? The Standard Model, being a Lorentz invariant theory, respects CPT symmetry. So any effective theory that is part of the SM (like SMEFT) must also respect CPT. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories that are Lorentz invariant. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, which is option 4.

Wait, but the question says "must be respected by all operators". So CPT is a must, but CP isn't. So the correct symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a second—what about Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translation invariance, but in SMEFT, the operators are higher-dimensional, and the theory's validity is up to a certain scale. Do the operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, the SMEFT operators are written in a way that they are local and Lorentz invariant. Since the theory is built from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant, the operators must also be Poincare invariant. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So now, looking at the options, which include which of these?

Option C is 1,2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Wait, but in the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that's correct.

Wait, but what about the original question: which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

So the answer should include 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Because the operators must respect Lorentz and hence Poincare, and CPT.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, that's option C: 1,2,4. So the correct choice is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model that includes higher-dimensional operators while respecting certain symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for consistency with the Standard Model, which is also Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is built from Standard Model fields, which respect Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric due to the CKM mechanism, which introduces CP violation. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, it must also respect CPT symmetry. This is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories that are Lorentz-invariant.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
