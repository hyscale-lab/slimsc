Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Let's see what the given data is.

The problem says that the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. Hmm, I remember that when particles are produced, their decay lengths depend on their lifetimes and velocities.

Wait, decay length is like how far a particle travels before decaying, right? So the formula for mean decay distance should involve the lifetime of the particle multiplied by its velocity and maybe some other factors. Oh right, the formula I think is: L = γ c τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? I remember that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but wait, the width Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of energy multiplied by time? So I'll have to make sure the units are compatible.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor γ.
2. Find the proper lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
