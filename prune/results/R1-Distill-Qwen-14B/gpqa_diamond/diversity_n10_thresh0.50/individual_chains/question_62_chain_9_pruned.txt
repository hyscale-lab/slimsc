Okay, so I've got this synthesis problem to solve. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group. Wait, no, the main chain might be different. Wait, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so that's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. And then, the substituent is at position 1, which is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

So, the structure would be: a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) and a branch that's a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So, something like cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2-cyclohexanecarbaldehyde?

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached, right? So, it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the steps needed.

First, perhaps we need to functionalize the triple bond. Reagents with NaNH2 and methyl chloride might be for a alkyne alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So maybe the ethynyl group is being alkylated. Adding a methyl group? So, ethynyl would become CH2C≡C... but wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. If we treat it with NaNH2 and CH3Cl, perhaps we're adding a methyl group via a substitution? Or maybe it's for a coupling reaction.

Alternatively, NaNH2 could deprotonate the alkyne to form a lithium acetylide. Wait, but with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, Friedel-Crafts is usually for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkyne alkylation. So, the alkyne would be deprotonated to form an acetylide, which would then react with methyl chloride. Hmm, but methyl chloride is a primary alkyl halide; when an acetylide reacts with an alkyl halide, it typically does so via a substitution. So, R-C≡C- Na+ would react with CH3Cl to give R-C≡C-CH2-Cl? No, wait, no, acetylide is R-C≡C^-. Reacting with CH3Cl would give R-C≡C-CH3? Wait, but CH3Cl is a primary alkyl chloride. Acetylide attack would add the CH3 group. So perhaps the ethynyl group (which is -C≡CH) would become -C≡C-CH3. But wait, ethynyl has the triple bond between two carbons, so if we alkylate once, maybe we add another carbon.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH2 group? Or is it a terminal alkyne? Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, when treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps it's for adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, when you have a terminal alkyne (like -C≡CH), NaNH2 would deprotonate it to form the acetylide ion (-C≡C^-). Then, reacting with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would lead to alkylation, turning it into -C≡C-CH3. So the product would be cyclohexane with a propynyl group (but that's an internal alkyne now). Hmm, but wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. Adding a methyl group would make it -C≡C-CH3, which is a propynyl group attached to cyclohexane.

So after step 1, the molecule is now cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group.

Next step: looking at the options. Let's see what the options have. Option A: step 2 is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably reducing the triple bond. So, if in step 1 we added a methyl to make a propynyl group, step 2 would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. So propynyl would become propane. So the molecule
