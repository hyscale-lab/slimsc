Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about molecules and quantum states. Hmm, the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms, so X and Y in this case. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. But wait, sometimes people confuse the terms, like fundamental state with the ground state. Oh wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, so the fundamental state here probably refers to the lowest vibrational state but maybe the rotational part is in the lowest as well? Or maybe just the lowest overall energy state.

The problem says that a photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I guess the photon's energy should be just enough to take the molecule to the next possible energy level. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration. So the energy of the molecule is a combination of rotational and vibrational energies.

The question asks about the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, the momentum p of a photon is related to its energy E by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. Because photons have momentum, but they don't have mass, their momentum is E/c.

So the plan is: find the energy of the photon that the molecule absorbs, then compute its momentum.

But wait, what's the energy needed for the molecule to go to the next state? Let me think. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which I think is the ground state (lowest energy
