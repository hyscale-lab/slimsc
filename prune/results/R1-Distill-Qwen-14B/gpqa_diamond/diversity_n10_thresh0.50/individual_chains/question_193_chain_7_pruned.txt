Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, they're saying N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait no, wait. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, if d is the distance in parsecs, plx = 1/d. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. Because plx = 1/d, so plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. 

So substituting into the equation, N ∝ 1/(1/d^5) ) → 1/(1/d^5) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Oh yeah, 1 over (1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh wait,
