Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Let me think through this step by step.

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Since both photospheres are in LTE, the Boltzmann equation should apply here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this case, the problem says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, the ratio for star 1 would be n1_i/n1_j = 2, and for star 2, n2_i/n2_j would be something else. But wait, no, the question says the excitation is twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2. So I think it's n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps, wait, maybe star_1's excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level relative to the lower one.

Wait, actually, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for each star, the number of atoms in the excited state is being considered. So for star_1, n1_i is twice as high as n2_i? Or wait, no, perhaps it's the ratio (n_i / n_j) for star 1 is twice that of the ratio for star 2.

Wait, no, let me clarify. Let's denote E as the energy of a certain level, and E' as the lower level. So, the excitation is the population in E relative to E'. So for star 1, (n_E / n_E') = 2 * (n_E / n_E') for star 2.

Wait, no.
