Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then determining the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, let me break this down.

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1. So:

(2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9)/2= 9/2=4.5? Wait, wait, wait. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recalculate. Oh right, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in the numbers: 2*8=16, +2=18. H is 9, X is 0 (no halogens), N is1. So (18-9 +1)/2 =10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be from a benzene ring (3 double bonds equivalent) plus a double bond or ring, and a carbonyl group maybe.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

So the 9.72 ppm is a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But sometimes aromatic protons can be in that region too, but the triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group or something. Hmm.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating to 2H. That sounds like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two protons in a para position. The 6.98 might be the protons meta to a substituent, and 6.51 the ones ortho? Or maybe the other way around. Alternatively, this could be a di-substituted benzene ring, perhaps with two substituents in para positions, each causing their own set of doublets.

The 6.27 is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange, like an acidic proton, such as from an -OH group. But wait, a singlet with 2H could be something else. Maybe it's a diene proton? Or perhaps it's a pair of equivalent protons attached to an oxygen, like a diol? Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substitution, but I'm not certain yet.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating to 2H. That's in the range for a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group, like O. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to a carbonyl, like an aldehyde or
