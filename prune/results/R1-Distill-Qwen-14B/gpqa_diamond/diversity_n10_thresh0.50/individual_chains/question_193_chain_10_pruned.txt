Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs, right?

So, the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Wait, let me write that down. N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r (assuming r is the distance, but wait, parallax is in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, so maybe I should clarify the units later, but for the relation, it might not matter here).

So substituting plx with 1/r, because plx = 1/r. So replacing plx in the equation, N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/(1/r)^5 equals r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, wait, that's about how N changes as a function of r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by a factor of r^5. But wait, more precisely, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would
