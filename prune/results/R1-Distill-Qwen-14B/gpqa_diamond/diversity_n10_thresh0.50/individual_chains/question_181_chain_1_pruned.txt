Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially the proton-proton chain. Oh right, the pp-III branch is one part of that chain. The question says that this branch stops suddenly about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to the Earth. So any effects from the core would take that long to reach us. But how does that affect neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton chain. I think the pp-III branch is one of the later steps, maybe producing higher-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the flux of neutrinos from that process would drop.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what determines the flux distribution?

I remember that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos of a certain energy. For example, in the main pp chain, the dominant neutrino emission is from the decay of boron-8, which emits neutrinos around 15-20 MeV. Wait, but the pp-III branch might be a different part. Let me think: the pp chain has different branches. The main one is pp-I, which goes through boron-8, and then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, pp-III might involve triple-alpha reactions or something else, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe pp-III refers to a specific part of the chain that produces lower-energy neutrinos.

Wait, another approach: the neutrino production in the Sun. The dominant neutrinos come from the boron-8 decay, which is part of the pp-I branch. But there are other sources, like the pp-III branch which might produce lower-energy neutrinos. Or wait, maybe the pp-III branch is actually part of the CNO cycle? No, the CNO cycle produces different neutrinos as well. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. 

Wait, the main neutrinos we detect from the Sun are the boron-8 neutrinos, which have energies around 15-20 MeV. But the question is about lower energies, like 700-8
