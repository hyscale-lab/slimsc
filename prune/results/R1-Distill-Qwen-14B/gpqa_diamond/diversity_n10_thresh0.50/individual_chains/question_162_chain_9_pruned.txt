Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2D metric because it has dx and dy terms. But wait, the options are about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. So its geometry is hyperbolic.

Wait, the question says radius r=2. Oh, but wait, the metric doesn't seem to have an r parameter in it. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps the metric is in terms of some coordinates that aren't the usual polar coordinates.

Let me think. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, I can rewrite this as ds² = (32/(4 - (x²+y²))) (dx² + dy²). Let me denote (x² + y²) as r², but wait, in 2D, r is usually the radial coordinate. But wait, this isn't the standard polar coordinate system because the metric is conformally flat—meaning it's just a scaling of the Euclidean metric. So the metric is conformally related to flat space, with the conformal factor being 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

Wait, this looks a lot like the metric for the hyperb
