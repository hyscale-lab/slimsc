Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's happening.

So, the first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with excess KOH, resulting in a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. 

Hmm, KOH is a strong base. When dibrominated compounds react with a strong base, especially under heat, elimination reactions are common. Since it's dibromoadamantane, which is a bridged bicyclic compound, the reaction likely involves dehydrohalogenation. Each bromine is on the adamantane structure, so elimination would form a double bond. Since there are two bromines, perhaps two eliminations happen?

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the structure has two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane ring? Or maybe on opposite positions. Anyway, elimination would probably form an alkene. But wait, elimination of two HBr molecules would form a diene? Or perhaps each Br leaves to form a double bond between adjacent carbons. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more about the NMR.

The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. Oh, wait! Maybe it's not elimination. If KOH is acting as a base, but maybe it's more of an E2 elimination, but that usually forms alkenes, not carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that also leads to alkenes. Wait, but where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with excess KOH and heat, elimination is more likely.

Wait, another angle: The product after KOH has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a ketone (around 1700-1750). So, if product 1 has a ket
