Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form sodium acetate and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Right, because 20 +20 is 40. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is going to be lower. Let me calculate that first.

The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) times molarity. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles remain the same, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =
