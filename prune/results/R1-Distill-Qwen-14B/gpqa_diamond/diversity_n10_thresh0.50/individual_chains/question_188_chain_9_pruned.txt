Okay, I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the unit cell parameters. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have a specific structure where all edges are equal, but the angles between them are not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in this case, the angles α, β, and γ are all 30 degrees. Also, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance... so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along one edge of the unit cell? So 'a' would be 10 Angstrom, since in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are of length 'a'. 

Interplanar distance is calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos α)/a² )? No, wait, I think I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cosθ)/a² )) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember the formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic system, but this is rhombohedral. Oh right, the general formula for any crystal system is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²)
