Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Let's read it again carefully.

We have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e? So each charge is twice the elementary charge. Okay, so each has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 C, which is about 3.2e-19 C.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so the 13th is at the center, point P, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. So their positions are fixed at 2m from P.

We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D, with some numbers given.

Wait, the system's energy. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges can be calculated by considering each pair and summing their potential energies. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant.

So the system has 13 charges, but the 13th is fixed at P. Let's think about all the interactions. The 13th charge at P will interact with each of the 12 charges at 2m. Also, each of the 12 charges at 2m will interact with each other, right? So the total potential energy will be the sum of all these pairwise interactions.

Wait, but potential energy is a property of the system, so yes, it's all the pairs. So the total potential energy U_total is the sum of U between the central charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges.

Let me break it down.

First, the interaction between the central charge (q13) and each of the other 12 charges (q1 to q12). Each of these pairs is at a distance r = 2m.

So for each of these 12 pairs, the potential energy U is (k * q13 * q_i) / r.

But wait, since all charges are identical, each q_i is 2
