Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so they're represented by convex combinations of projectors.

Wait, so in this case, ρ is an equal mixture of |0> and |1>. Each term is a projector, and they're each multiplied by 1/2. So ρ = (I)/2, since |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix for a qubit. Oh yeah, because for a 2x2 system, |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, |1><1| is 0 and 1 on the diagonal. So adding them gives identity, and then multiplied by 1/2 makes each diagonal element 1/2. So ρ is (I)/2.

But the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I think qubit space is represented in Bloch sphere terms. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and in the Bloch sphere, it's a vector pointing from the origin to a point on the surface of the unit sphere. The vector's components correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but when the state is a mixed state, like this one, it's not on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Instead, it's at the origin because the density matrix becomes the maximally mixed state. So in Bloch vector terms, the vector r would be (0,0,0), right?

Let me think again. The density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. For the maximally mixed state, ρ is I/2. So comparing, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies r·σ must be zero, so r is the zero vector. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the correct answer. The other options don't look right. Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0> if it's pure, but this is a mixed state so it's not on the surface. Option A is (1,1,0), which would be a pure state, but our state is mixed. Option D is (1,1,1), which would also be a pure state, but again, we have a mixed state here.

So the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In terms of the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a general qubit state, the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is related to the density matrix by 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given density matrix, it is evident that \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is the position of the maximally mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\(r = (1,1,0)\))**: This would correspond to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **Option B (\(r = (0,0,1)\))**: This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **Option C (\(r = (0,0,0)\))**: This correctly represents the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D (\(r = (1,1,1)\))**: This would correspond to a pure state, not a mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
