Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. So, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness over time. The setup is that astronomers are observing this star, and the spots are on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and the effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are 20% filling factor and have a 1000K temperature difference. The question is about how a hypothetical exoplanet would compare in terms of producing the same brightness variation.

Wait, so the scenario is that when the star is observed, the spots cause brightness variations because as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. But these variations can look similar to those caused by a planet transiting in front of the star. So, the question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do.

I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So the fractional change in brightness is the square of the ratio of their radii.

But wait, the problem says that the star itself has these spots, so the brightness variation is due to the spots, not a planet. So we need to find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same change.

So first, let's figure out what the amplitude of variation is due to the spots. The star's brightness is modulated as the spots rotate into and out of view. The total brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

The star's normal brightness is based on its total surface area and temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the total brightness decreases. The maximum variation would be when the spots are at the center of the visible hemisphere, but since it's a hemisphere, maybe the spots are on one side.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is R_sun. Filling factor is 20%, which means 20% of the visible hemisphere is covered by spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The brightness variation would be the difference between the normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are covering that area.
