Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, I remember that bosons can decay into fermions, right? The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term. Let me see, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ_f bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about what this means. Oh right, the interaction term usually tells us about the force carriers. So this term is a Yukawa coupling maybe? Because Yukawa interactions involve a scalar field coupling to fermions.

The boson X here has a mass of 6 GeV. So I need to find all the possible decay modes of X at the lowest order. At lowest order, I think that means tree-level decays, so X decaying into two fermions, like X → f f_bar, right?

Wait, but what determines which fermions X can decay into? Oh, right, it depends on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So X mass is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair where each fermion has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

I should list all the fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's think about the known fermion masses. Electrons are very light, about 0.5 Me
