Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, the question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and X is lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases due to relativistic effects. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the speed.

Gamma (γ) is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given v is 0.96c, let's compute that. So substituting v = 0.96c into the equation:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 ÷ 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, but wait, 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E_rest is m * c². So I need to find the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus.

Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of approximately 1.007276 GeV/c² and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So the mass of lithium-6 is (3
