Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so that's in two dimensions, right? Because it's only got dx and dy terms. So this is a 2-dimensional metric. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface in anti-de Sitter space or something related to hyperbolic geometry. But in 2D, the pseudosphere is like a hyperbola, but maybe in this context, it's a different kind of surface.

Wait, pseudosphere in 2D is a surface of constant negative curvature. So the metric probably describes such a space. Let me think about how to find the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere... I remember that for a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, the total area is actually infinite. Because, as you go outwards, the area keeps increasing without bound. But wait, the given metric might represent something else.

Alternatively, maybe this metric is for a sphere in some coordinate system. Let me try to analyze the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is similar to the metric of a sphere. For example, in spherical coordinates, when you have r^2 = x² + y², the metric for a sphere of radius a would have a term like (a²)/(a² - r²) for the line element, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a hyperbolic metric, but the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which suggests something else.

Wait, when 4 - (x² + y²) is positive, the metric is positive. So the domain of x and y is such that x² + y² <4. So the space is the interior of a circle of radius 2, but with a specific metric. So perhaps this is a 2D space with a singularity at x² + y² =4.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but this is a 2D metric. Hmm, perhaps this is a coordinate system for a 2D surface, and the pseudosphere in this context is the entire space.

Wait, maybe the area isn't straightforward. Let me think about how to compute the area from the metric. The area in a 2D space with metric ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j is computed by integrating the square root of determinant of the metric tensor over the region.

The given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor g in terms of coordinates (x,y) is diagonal, with g_{xx}=g_{yy}=32/(4 - x² - y²). The determinant is (32/(4 - r²))², where r² =x² + y².

Wait, but the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) is (32/(4 - r²)). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but r is sqrt(x² + y²), so r² =x² + y². So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. Hmm, but integrating this over the entire domain where r² <4 (since the denominator must be positive) would require polar coordinates perhaps.

Let me switch to polar coordinates. x = r cosθ, y= r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. So dA becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. First, integrate over θ: the integral from 0 to 2π of dθ is 2π. So the area becomes 32 * 2π * ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to2.

Wait, 32 * 2π is 64π. So the integral becomes 64π ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let me solve that integral. Let me let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) becomes ∫ ( -du/2 ) / u ) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is ( -1/2 ) ∫ (du/u) from 4 to 0 → which is ( -1/2 ) [ln u ] from 4 to 0 → ( -1/2 ) [ ln 0 - ln4 ] → but ln 0 is negative infinity, so this becomes ( -1/2 ) ( -∞ - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. Wait, so the integral is divergent. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the options have option D as +infty. So the area would be infinite. But why?

Wait, because the denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2. So as r approaches 2, the area element becomes larger and larger, leading to an infinite area when integrating up to r=2.

So the area of the pseudosphere radius 2 is infinite. So the answer should be option D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in this context, the metric represents such a space. To compute the area, we use the standard formula for the area element in a 2D metric:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the metric tensor. For the given metric, the determinant of \( g \) is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element transforms to:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then given by the integral:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( \theta \), which contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \). The area becomes:

\[
A = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). The limits of integration change: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges, and the area becomes infinite. This divergence arises because the metric has a singularity at \( r = 2 \), where the denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) approaches zero, causing the area element to blow up.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
