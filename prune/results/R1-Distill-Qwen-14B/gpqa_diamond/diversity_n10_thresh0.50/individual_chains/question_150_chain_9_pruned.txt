Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and there are three reagents used in a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options provided.

Hmm, the first step is probably to analyze the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. Once I have that, I can see what each reaction does and determine the product.

Let me look at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Starting with the most downfield peak: 9.72 ppm. That's a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. I remember that carbonyl groups like aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a sharp peak. But this is a triplet. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from a phenol? Phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, so maybe not. Another possibility is an enol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, another thought: the triplet suggests that this proton is next to two equivalent protons. Maybe it's an aldehyde with two adjacent CH2 groups? Not sure yet. Let me think about the other peaks.

Looking at the aromatic region:

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)

The first two are doublets, each integrating for 2H. The 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. So maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with two substituents, perhaps para, and another group attached. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of protons in a para-substituted benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with two
