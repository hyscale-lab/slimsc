Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when we talk about states and operators, we're dealing with vectors and matrices, right? So the question is about finding probabilities and an average value of an operator.

The state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I guess these are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles, like electrons. Their spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

First, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional. So the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. To find the normalization factor, I need to compute the norm of this vector.

The norm squared is the sum of the magnitudes squared of each coefficient. So magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So squared is 2. For (2-i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). Squared is 5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question didn't ask about that yet. The main task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given. Oh right, the operator A has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we have |up> and |down>, so two basis states. So A is a 2x2 matrix.

Let me write out matrix A. The diagonal elements (where i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) elements are ħ/2. So, A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Hmm, this looks familiar. I think this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.
