Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning the ropes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, right, so eigenvectors and eigenvalues are a big part of linear algebra in quantum mechanics. The operator P is given in components: Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, first, I should remember that the operator P is a vector operator, and the components satisfy the angular momentum algebra. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators (like Lx, Ly, Lz) have similar forms. So maybe P is similar to angular momentum, but scaled by ħ/2 instead of ħ.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of P along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary in x-z, meaning it's somewhere between x and z. Since it's an arbitrary direction, I might need to represent it with spherical coordinates or something like that.

But wait, the eigenvector of a vector operator along a direction n is the state with maximum eigenvalue for that direction. So for spin-½ particles, the eigenvalue for the component along any direction is ±ħ/2. Since the eigenvalue here is +ħ/2, the eigenv
