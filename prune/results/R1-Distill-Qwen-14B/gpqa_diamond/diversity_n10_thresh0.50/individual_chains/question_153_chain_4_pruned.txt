Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually enolate, and it attacks the beta position, leading to a conjugate addition.

Let me first look at the problem. There are three reaction parts: (A), (B), and (C). For each, I need to find the reactants and major products. Then, I have to match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction (A):
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, this is a Michael addition scenario.

I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups adjacent to each other. The structure is (CH3COO)2CH-. So when it deprotonates, it can form an enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. Since it's E, the configuration is trans. So, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 perhaps, wait, maybe I should draw it. The structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with the substituents in the E position. No, wait, the acrylate is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent (p-tolyl) is on carbon 3. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The formula is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be substituent on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, maybe the substituent is on the second carbon. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to imagine the structure: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the formula CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for 3-(p-tolyl), the p-tolyl group is at the third position. Wait, but that would make the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but that can't be because the numbering is off. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because the acrylate ester is CH2=CHCOO- something. Hmm, maybe I should think that the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? No, perhaps I should look for the structure another way.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, that's not right because acrylate should have three carbons, right? So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So, CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's just proceed with the reaction.

In the Michael addition, the enolate of the nucleophile (dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate). So, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the acrylate, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond formation.

So, the acrylate has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the carbonyl is on carbon 3. The p-tolyl group is on carbon 3 as well? Maybe the acrylate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH(p-tolyl). Wait, no, perhaps that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-
