Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations we observe. Then it's comparing that to the effect a planet would have. Hmm.

So the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is same as Sun's radius. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The dark spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, what's a filling factor? Oh right, I think it's the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So like, 20% of the hemisphere area is dark spots.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are cooler than the rest of the star. The star's Teff is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000.

Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness variations would happen as that hemisphere faces us and then turns away. So the photometric observations (brightness over time) would show changes because of the spots' rotation.

The question is about how this can mimic an exoplanet's effect. So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same brightness changes (same amplitude in the light curve) as the spots do.

I think I need to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar that would produce the same ΔF (change in flux) as the spots do.

So let me think about how the brightness variation works for both cases.

First, the star with spots. The total flux from the star without spots would be based on its entire surface at 6000K. But when spots are present, when the spots are visible, the total flux decreases because the spots are cooler.

The flux from a star is proportional to the surface area times the temperature to the fourth power. Wait, no, each point on the star emits flux according to its area element and its T^4. So the total flux is the integral over the surface. For a uniform star, it's 4π R^2 * sigma * T^4.

But with spots, part of
