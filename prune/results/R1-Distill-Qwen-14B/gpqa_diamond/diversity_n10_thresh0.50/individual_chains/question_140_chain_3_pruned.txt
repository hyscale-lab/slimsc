Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

First, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X. The reaction is violent and produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and releases B when heated. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I'm supposed to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's think about each part.

Starting with the reaction: X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, B is released. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the protons. Since the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons, that probably means it's a noble gas because noble gases have atoms with full valence shells. Wait, but noble gases are monoatomic, right? So, for a noble gas, each atom has equal number of protons and neutrons? Let me think. For example, He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? No, wait, He has two protons and usually 2 neutrons for the most common isotope (He-4). So, He has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. So He's a possibility. Another example: Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons for Ne-20, which is the most common isotope. So W could be He or Ne, maybe Ar? Ar would have 18 each? No, Ar typically has 40 as the mass number. So 18 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, that wouldn't match. Because Ar's atomic number is 18, so protons are 18. If the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, then the atom must have 18 protons and 18 neutrons. But natural Ar is Ar-40, which has 18 protons and 22 neutrons. Oh, so maybe it's a different noble gas.

Wait, maybe it's not a noble gas? Let me think again. W is a gas, so perhaps it's CO2 or something else. But the problem says each molecule has same number of protons and
