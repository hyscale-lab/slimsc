Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a go.

The setup is a bit complicated. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, which is also spherical. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. 

The options are four possible expressions involving these variables. I need to pick the right one.

Hmm. So, I remember from my studies that when charges are placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So how does that work?

In a conductor, charges can move freely. If a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's electrons will rearrange themselves. Since the conductor was neutral, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have an induced charge equal and opposite to +q. So, inner surface has -q. But what about the outer surface? Since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner charge.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. The cavity has +q. The conductor's inner surface must have -q (as induced), so the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's total charge zero. Right. So the outer surface is +q.

But how does that affect the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the charge enclosed within, considering the Gaussian surface. So when you're outside the conductor, the field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, no. For a conductor with charge on the outside, the field outside is the same as if the charge were a point charge at
