Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Let's see.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Okay, so the star's temperature changes when spots are present.

The key part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet range. 

I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, g is the statistical weight, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Since the problem is asking about the ratio when spots are present versus when they're not, I think we can model this as two different effective temperatures affecting the same transition. Wait, but when the spots are present, the overall effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. So the star's average Teff is lower, which would affect the excitation of atoms in the photosphere.

Wait, but wait. The spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500K. But the star's overall luminosity would change, right? But wait, the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. Oh, but wait, when spots are present, the observed Teff is lower because a fraction of the surface is cooler. But the question is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere when spots are present. Wait, no. The photosphere is the star's atmosphere, but when spots are present, are they part of the photosphere? I think dark spots are cooler regions on the photosphere. So the effective temperature of the photosphere as a whole goes down.

But wait, the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's average temperature is lower.

The ratio of Ti atoms in two levels depends on the temperature. Because the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So when T decreases, the exponential factor decreases because the denominator is smaller. So if the temperature is lower, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease, assuming ΔE is positive (which it is because level 2 is higher in energy than level 1).

Wait, wait. Actually, ΔE is E2 - E1. So if the energy is higher in level 2, ΔE is positive. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) gets smaller, which makes the ratio n2/n1 smaller. So when T decreases, the ratio decreases.

The problem states that when the star has spots (Teff 5500 K), the ratio decreases compared to when it doesn't have spots (6000 K). So the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present.

So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

But wait, the problem asks for the factor
