Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values for each point.

First, I should remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the reaction produces the acetate ion and water. At the equivalence point, the solution should be a buffer solution if you're using a weak acid and strong base. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. For a weak acid and strong base, the equivalence point would be when all the acid is neutralized, so the solution would contain the conjugate base. Since the conjugate base of acetic acid is acetate, which is CH3COO⁻. Acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it should hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic. So the equivalence point pH should be above 7.

But wait, let me get back. The first part is about calculating pH at 25% titration. Then the second part is the equivalence point.

Let me break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the initial concentration after dilution.

We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (since 20+20=40). The concentration after dilution would be (volume1 * concentration1) / total volume.

So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, volume is 0.04 L (40 cm³), so new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Step 2: Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, we need to figure out the 25% titration point and the equivalence point.

First, let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles.

Volume of NaOH = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 =
