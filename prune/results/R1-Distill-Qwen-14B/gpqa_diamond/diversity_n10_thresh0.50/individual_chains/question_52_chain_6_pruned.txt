Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem involves a star with certain parameters and some observations about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The question is about how this ratio changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio decreases when there are spots.

Wait, the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, I think we need to compute the ratio when there are no spots (normal) and when there are spots, and then find the factor (normal ratio divided by spotted ratio, or the other way around?).

Oh, the ratio is N1/N2, the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. And this ratio decreases when spots are present. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So, the factor will be (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

Wait, but why does the ratio decrease when the star has spots? Because the effective temperature of the photosphere has changed. The star's photosphere is in LTE, so we can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), right? Because N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), so N
