Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a set of reactions. I need to find the final product from the options A to D. Let's break it down.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO, so the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, but here there's none. So substituting, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, another way: each degree is a ring or double bond. So for C8H9NO: the formula can be rewritten considering the molecular formula as C8H9NO. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnH2n+2. Here, H count is 9. So 2n+2 = 9? That would be n=3.5, which isn't possible. So I think I should use the DoU formula correctly.

DoU formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO, C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That means five rings or double bonds. But wait, that seems high for a molecule. Alternatively, maybe I should recount. Let me think: each ring or double bond is one DoU. Each triple bond counts as two, etc.

So 5 DoU could be, for example, one ring and four double bonds (but that's unlikely), or maybe three rings and two double bonds, or other combinations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the molecular formula C8H9NO has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 N, and 1 O. Now, let's think about the possible structures. The NMR data is given, so perhaps that can help.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes typically resonate around 9-10 ppm. So maybe an aldehyde group is present.

Then, 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H.

6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. These two signals suggest a pair of aromatic protons. Wait, maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shifts (like 6
