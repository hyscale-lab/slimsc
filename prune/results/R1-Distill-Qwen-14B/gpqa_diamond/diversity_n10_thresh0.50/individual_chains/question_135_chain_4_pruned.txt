Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So, the question is about the bosonic field X interacting with fermions, and we're supposed to find the kinematically allowed decay channels for X at the lowest order.

Alright, first, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about what this means. Oh, right, the interaction term would typically be something like λ X ψ̄ ψ, right? So this seems to describe X coupling to fermions with some coupling constant λ.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So, when it decays, its mass must be at least twice the mass of each particle in the decay products. Because for decay to happen, the mass of the decaying particle has to be greater than or equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products.

So I need to consider which fermion-antifermion pairs can be produced with a total rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let me list the fermion masses I know.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). Their masses are approximately:
- u ≈ 2 MeV
- d ≈ 5 MeV
- s ≈ 100 MeV
- c ≈ 1.5 GeV
- b ≈ 4.5 GeV
- t ≈ 173 GeV (way too heavy, so X can't decay into top quarks)
Leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ), and their neutrinos. The charged leptons' masses:
- e ≈ 0.5 MeV
- μ ≈ 105 MeV
- τ ≈ 1.78 GeV

Wait, but wait. When a boson decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion's mass is counted twice because you have two particles. So for X to decay into a pair like ff̄, the sum of their masses must be ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's go through each possible fermion pair and see if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

For quarks:
- u: 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed
- d: 2*5 MeV = 10 MeV → allowed
- s: 2*100 MeV = 0.2 GeV → allowed
- c: 2*1.5 GeV = 3 GeV → allowed
- b: 2*4.5 GeV = 9 GeV → which is more than 6 GeV. So b is too heavy. So X can't decay into b bbar.

For leptons:
- e: 2*0.5 MeV = 1 MeV → allowed
- μ: 2*105 MeV = 0.21 GeV → allowed
- τ: 2*1.
