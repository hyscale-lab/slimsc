Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. They react violently and release a gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. From that, I'm thinking maybe W is a noble gas because noble gases are usually inert, but wait, the reaction is violent, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic gas where the number of protons and neutrons in each atom are the same. Let's think: for example, O2 would have 8 protons each. Neutrons would be 8 each, but that's only if it's the isotope O-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So O has an atomic number of 8. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons total? Or wait, no. Each molecule has two atoms. So each O atom has 8 protons, and if each O is O-16, 8 neutrons each, then the molecule has 2*(8+8) = 32 nucleons. But the question says W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, wait, the molecule as a whole or each atom?

Wait, the question says, "W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So for the molecule as a whole. Let's think about possible gases. So if W is, say, H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal. Not good. What about He? He is a noble gas, monatomic. So each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's He-4). So molecule (single atom) has 2 each. That works. So W could be He. But wait, the reaction is violent, so maybe not He. Or perhaps another gas.

Wait, another thought: if it's a molecule where each atom contributes equally. Like O2: each O has 8 protons and, say, 8 neutrons. So two O atoms would make 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 16 each. That fits. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that matches
