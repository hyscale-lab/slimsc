Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each, and then match them with the given options.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate are the reactants with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile in Michael additions because it's a dienolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. In a Michael reaction, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So, when dimethyl malonate (which acts as the nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the acrylate, the product would be a conjugate addition product. Let me draw this mentally. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituent on the 3 position. So the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. No, wait, maybe I got the positions wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the substituent is on the middle carbon. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3, but I'm a bit mixed up. Wait, no, the numbering for acrylates: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So substituents on C
