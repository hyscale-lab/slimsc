Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, okay, I remember that stability constants are involved in complex formation. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So each β corresponds to a different complex. For example, β1 is probably the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- maybe, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, wait, I should think about the charges. Each SCN- is -1. So for Co(II), which is +2.

Let me see. Let's say each complex has n SCN- ions. The charge on the complex would be 2 - n*(1) since each SCN is -1. So:

n=1 → 2-1 = +1 → [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
n=2 → 2-2=0 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40
n=3 → 2-3= -1 → [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63
n=4 → 2-4= -2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4=16

Wait, but sometimes the formation constants are given for the stepwise addition. So β1 is the first formation step: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ with K1=β1. Then β2 is the next step, adding another SCN: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so K2=β2. Similarly, each subsequent β is the formation constant for adding another SCN.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. But wait, no, actually, the overall formation constant is K_total = β1 * β2 * ... βn. Because each step is a separate formation.

Wait, no. No, wait. For the overall complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), the formation constant is the product of all the individual stepwise constants up to that point. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the total K would be β1 * β2. Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^- it's β1β2β3, and so on.

But wait, the problem lists the βs as four separate values. Hmm. Wait, perhaps β1 is for the first
