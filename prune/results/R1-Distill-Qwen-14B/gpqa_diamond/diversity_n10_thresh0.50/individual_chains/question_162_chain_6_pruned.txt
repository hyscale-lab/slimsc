Okay, so I have this metric given, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think. 

The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric. So this is a 2D space described by this line element. 

I remember that the area of a surface in 2D can be found using the standard area element, which is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in this case, the metric is conformally flat because it's written as a scalar function times (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor g_{ij} would be a diagonal matrix with the same component in both dx and dy directions. 

The general form is ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is some function of x and y. In this case, E is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of the metric tensor g would just be E, because for a diagonal metric, the determinant is the product of the diagonal terms, and since it's the same for both, it's E squared? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the metric is diagonal with E and E, so the determinant is E * E = E². But wait, wait, no, for two dimensions, the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero here, it's just g_xx * g_yy.
