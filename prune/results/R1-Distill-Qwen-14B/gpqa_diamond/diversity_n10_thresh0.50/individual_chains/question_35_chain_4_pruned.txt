Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me some information and asks which statement is correct.

First, let me parse what the question is saying. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, AY, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, right? Because I remember the Pauli matrices. Yeah, the Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, AY = (h/(4π)) * S.

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of AY. But the question is about which statement is correct during this calculation.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each step.

Eigenvalues of AY: since AY is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(AY - a I) = 0. But wait, AY is c times S. So let's see, since S is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are ±1. Oh right! Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1 for each component. So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of AY would be c times those. So a = c * 1 = h/(4π) *1 = h/(4π), and the other eigenvalue is -h/(4π). Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Let's compute S's eigenvalues to confirm.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvalues, I can calculate the trace and determinant. The trace of S is 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (i^2)(-1) = 0 - (-1) = 1. So the characteristic equation is λ^2 - (trace)λ + determinant = λ^2 + 1 = 0. So solutions are λ = ±i. Wait, that's strange. Wait no, wait. Oh wait, no, that can't be right because S
