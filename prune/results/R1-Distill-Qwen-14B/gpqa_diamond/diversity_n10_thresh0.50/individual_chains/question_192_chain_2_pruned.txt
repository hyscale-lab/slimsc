Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and it has a small cavity inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, and the distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense since they are outside. The angle between l and s is theta. 

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, initially, there are no charges on it. But when we place a charge inside the cavity, things change. 

Wait a second, I think when you have a cavity inside a conductor, any charge inside the cavity induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Oh right, because the conductor was neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. So if the charge inside is +q, the inner surface will have -q. 

But wait, because the charge is inside the cavity, which is itself a conductor? No, wait, the cavity is just a hollow
