Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think through what I know. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium... Oh right, normally in a medium like glass, the speed is c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving. So I guess I have to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

I remember something about the Doppler effect and relativistic velocities, but I'm not too sure. Oh wait, but maybe this is a relativistic scenario. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to consider special relativity.

Wait, but glass moving at velocity v. I think the problem is considering the glass's motion relative to the lab frame. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame is not just (c/n) because of the movement.

Wait, no, maybe the speed of light in the medium is always c/n in that medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, what do we observe?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of adding velocities. Like, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light is moving at (c/n) relative to the glass. Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion towards the observer, would the lab frame see the light's speed as (c/n) + v? But wait, that doesn't account for relativistic effects where velocities don't just add linearly.

Wait, but the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Oh wait, no, that's the speed of light in a vacuum. In a medium, the speed is lower, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Hmm, maybe I should think about frames of reference. Let me consider the glass as the rest frame. In that frame, light travels at speed v_light = c/n. Now, to find the speed in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v towards the observer, meaning the lab is moving at -v relative to the glass).

Wait, there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The velocity u' of an object in the lab frame when observed from the glass frame (which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab) is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c² )

But wait, in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass frame, the light's speed is c/n towards the same direction as the glass's motion. Then, in the lab frame, the speed would be (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c² )

Simplify that denominator: (c² + (c/n)*v ) / c² → but wait, let me compute it step by step.

Wait, the formula is u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)]

So u is the velocity of the light in the glass frame, which is (c/n) in that frame, in the same direction as the glass's velocity v.

So u' would be ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) )

So u' = ( (c/n + v) ) / ( 1 + (v/(n c)) )

Hmm, let's factor this:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate denominators.

Numerator: c + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u' = (c + n v) / (n + v)

Wait, but c is 1 in the problem statement. So substituting c=1:

u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v)

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which matches.

Alternatively, is there another approach? Maybe using the relativistic Doppler effect, but I don't think that applies here because we're talking about the speed, not the frequency or wavelength.

Wait another thing: if the glass's speed v is negligible compared to c, then the denominator (n + v) approximates to n, and the numerator is 1 + n v → so approximately (1 + n v)/n = (1/n) + v. But the speed of light in the medium is c/n =1/n. So the observed speed would be 1/n + v, which is higher than the speed in the medium. But wait, that can't be, because the speed of light can't exceed c, but if v is small, 1/n + v is still less than 1, since v is much less than 1.

But wait, in reality, the speed of light in a moving medium—what's the correct formula? Hmm, I think the approach I took with the velocity addition formula is correct, leading to option A.

Wait, but another thought: the problem might be a trick question. Because in the glass frame, the speed is 1/n. When the glass is moving, perhaps the light's speed in the lab is the same as in the medium? That can't be right because the medium is moving.

Wait, no, because the speed of light in a medium is always relative to the medium's frame. So if the medium is moving, the observed speed in the lab changes.

So yes, the initial approach seems correct, and the answer would be (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through the glass at a speed of \( \frac{c}{n} \) in the glass's rest frame, where \( n \) is the index of refraction and \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. The glass itself is moving at velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to eliminate the fraction:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the physical scenario described.

Answer: A
