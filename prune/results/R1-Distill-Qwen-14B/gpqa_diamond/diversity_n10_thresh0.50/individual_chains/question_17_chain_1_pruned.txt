Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, so maybe that's involved here.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio? So the complex is CaEDTA²- perhaps. And the K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. K usually refers to the formation constant, right? So K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex.

Wait, the formation constant equation. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and the K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is at ideal pH, I don't have to worry about the EDTA existing in different protonated forms, I guess.

So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M. Let's assume that the complex dissociates a little bit. Let me set up the variables. The initial concentrations are: [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both zero, but in reality, they'll form from the dissociation. 

Wait, no, actually, when the complex dissociates, some of it
