Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator P is probably a spin operator, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are often denoted with P, or sometimes S. Spin-½ particles like muons have spin operators that are proportional to the Pauli matrices. So the components of P, Px, Py, Pz, are each proportional to the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz multiplied by ħ/2. 

Looking at the given components:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. So yes, these are the spin matrices for a spin-½ system.

The question asks for the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n would have components (nx, 0, nz), with nx² + nz² =1.

The operator P here is the spin operator in the direction of n, which is given by P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by something. Wait, no, more accurately, for any direction n, the spin operator in that direction is (n · P) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y =0, so it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the question says to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n, but perhaps the operator they're considering is the component of P along n, which would be n·P. So the operator we're interested in is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Or is it the sum of all three components? No, no, because the operator along a specific direction is a linear combination of the components. So the operator would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero.

Wait, but the problem says "the operator P along an arbitrary direction n". So I think P here is the component of the spin in the direction n. So the operator is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, because n is in x-z plane, so n_y is 0. So we can ignore Py in this case.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write down P_n. Substituting Px and Pz:

P_n = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,
