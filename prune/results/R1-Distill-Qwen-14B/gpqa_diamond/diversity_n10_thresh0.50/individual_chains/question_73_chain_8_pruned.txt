Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relativity problems can be tricky. I remember that adding velocities in relativity isn't as straightforward as regular addition because of the speed limit c.

So first, I think I need to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference of their speeds, but not just a regular subtraction. Oh right, I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(cÂ²)), right? Let me make sure. Oh wait, no, I think that's when they're moving relative to a common frame. Alternatively, maybe I should consider one astronaut's frame. Hmm. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as A. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait, I might have gotten that wrong. Let me clarify the setup. Are both astronauts moving in the same direction relative to some rest frame, like the Earth? Yes. So if I want to find the speed of one astronaut relative to the other, I need to transform their
