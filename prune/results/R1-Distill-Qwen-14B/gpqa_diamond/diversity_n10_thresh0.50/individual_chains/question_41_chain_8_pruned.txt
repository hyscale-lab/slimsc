Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is usually c divided by the refractive index, right? So normally, without any movement, the speed would be c/n. But since the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Oh, right, because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, there's some relativity involved here.

I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, the speed of light within that medium as observed can be affected. But wait, Einstein's theory of relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion. But this isn't a vacuumâ€”it's glass. So the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame might be different.

Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So the light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. Hmm, maybe I should consider the velocities as vectors. The light's speed in the glass is v_g = c/n. But since the glass is moving, the lab observer would see the light's velocity as the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass, but only if we're using classical addition, which might not be correct.

Wait, but relativity comes into play here because we're dealing with velocities that might approach the speed of light. Oh wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which for typical glass is around 0.7c or so. The velocity v of the glass is probably much smaller than c, so maybe we can use the classical velocity addition formula.

The classical formula is u' = u + v, where u is the velocity of the light relative to the medium, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab. But wait, that's only when the movement is along the same direction. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be u' = (c/n) + v. But wait, that can't be right because if v is added, it could exceed c, which would be impossible according to relativity. But since v is much smaller than c, maybe it's a non-relativistic approximation
