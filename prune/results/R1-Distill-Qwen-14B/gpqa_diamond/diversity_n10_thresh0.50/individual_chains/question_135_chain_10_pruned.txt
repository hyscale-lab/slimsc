Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit complicated. I think what's important here is that X interacts with fermions via some coupling. So when X decays, it will decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find out which fermions it can decay into. The key here is conservation of energy and the mass of each fermion pair.

Let me list the possible fermion pairs and their masses. Well, the fermions we have are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), electrons, muons, taus, and also maybe neutrinos. But wait, the interaction term probably doesn't involve neutrinos since the Lagrangian has ψ_f which includes charged leptons and quarks.

So for each fermion pair (like b b-bar, c c-bar, etc.), the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to the mass of X. But wait, no, actually, when a boson decays into two particles, the combined rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved, and for the decay to happen, the rest mass of the products can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle.

So X is 6 GeV. Let's list the masses of the fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Then the charged leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
