Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my classes that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I need to think about how relativity affects things.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in this setup. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators and relativity.

In the classical case (non-relativistic), the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA², where k is the spring constant and A is the amplitude. So the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so relativistic effects must come into play.

Relativistically, energy considerations change. The total energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Also, when speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. So I can't just use the classical approach here.

The force in this problem is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. But in a relativistic context, the equation of motion would involve terms from special relativity, probably leading to a modified form of the oscillator equation.

In the relativistic case, equations of motion are more complicated. I think the equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator might involve terms with velocity squared, leading to a form like (d/dt)(gamma m v) = -k x, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but solving such a differential equation might be tricky. Alternatively, I could think about energy conservation. In the relativistic scenario, the total energy E includes the rest mass energy (mc²), the kinetic energy, and the potential energy from the spring.

At maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At maximum speed, the displacement is zero, so all energy is kinetic plus rest mass energy.

Wait, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². At maximum amplitude A, x=A, so potential energy is (1
