Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this one is relativistic, so I guess that means we're dealing with speeds that are significant fractions of the speed of light, so we can't ignore relativistic effects.

The problem states that the mass is m and the maximum amplitude is A. So the oscillator moves back and forth between positions x = +A and x = -A. The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max. The options are given, so I need to figure out which formula correctly gives v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs at the equilibrium point (x=0), right? Because that's where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic case, so C might not be the right answer.

But wait, the options include terms with c, the speed of light, so clearly relativistic effects are in play here. So I need to think about how relativity changes things.
