Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 

Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. 

So the uncertainties are about 6.59e-7 eV and 6.59e-8 eV for the two states. 

The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of these two, right? Because each state has its own uncertainty, and when you measure the difference, you add the uncertainties. 

So total uncertainty ΔE_total ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 ≈ roughly 7.25e-7 eV. 

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 (ΔE) must be greater than this total uncertainty for them to be resolved. Let's think: E2 is higher energy since its lifetime is longer. So the energy difference would be E2 - E1 = ΔE. 

Looking at the options, which one is larger than 7.25e-7 eV? Let's check each option.

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001e-6, which is 1e-9. Way smaller than 7e-7. Not enough.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller. No.

Option C:1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4, which is 1e3 larger than 7.2
