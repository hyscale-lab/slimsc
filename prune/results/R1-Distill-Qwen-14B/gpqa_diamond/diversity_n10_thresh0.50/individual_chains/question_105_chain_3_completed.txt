Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about comparing the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star to the variation caused by star spots. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that a star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots when observed from Earth.

Wait, the key point here is that the brightness variation is being caused by a planet blocking the starlight (transit method) compared to the star spots causing variations as the star rotates. So, we need to calculate the relative radius of a planet that would cause the same change in brightness as the spots do.

Let me break it down.

First, when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is given by the ratio of the areas. The formula for the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are facing us (as the star rotates), the total brightness we observe decreases because we're not seeing the hotter parts of the star but the cooler spots. So the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view.

The brightness variation caused by the spots would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference. The total brightness of the star without spots is L = 4πR²σT⁴. But when spots are present, the observed brightness is L = L_star - L_spots.

Wait, but the filling factor comes into play here. The filling factor (f) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So f = 0.2, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. But wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots". So maybe the spots are on just one side, so the total area covered is f multiplied by the area of a hemisphere. Wait, hemisphere is half the star's surface, right?

Wait, no. The star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere would be 2πR². But if only one hemisphere is covered, then the total area covered by spots is f * (2πR²). Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire stellar disk covered by spots. So if the star is viewed as a disk, and one hemisphere is completely covered with spots, but with a filling factor of 20% on that hemisphere. Hmm, perhaps it's that the spots occupy 20% of the entire star's surface? Or is it 20% of the hemisphere?

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 0.2 on that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere). The area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So spots have area 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the entire star's area is 4π R². So spots cover 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 10% of the star's surface. Wait, but that would make the filling factor for the entire star 0.1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So the hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the total filling factor (fraction of entire surface) is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%.

But wait, the problem says "filling factor of 20%" on the hemisphere. So perhaps the spots are 20% of the entire star's surface? Because sometimes the filling factor is given as the fraction of the entire disk. So maybe the problem is that the spots occupy 20% of the entire star's surface area.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me clarify: the star has a radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots make up 20% of the area of that hemisphere. So the area covered is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the entire star's surface covered is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the hemisphere is entirely covered by spots with a 20% filling factor, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the star's entire surface. Hmm. Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So I think it's that 20% of that hemisphere is covered. So total area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the brightness variation when the spots come into view would be based on the difference in brightness between the spotted and non-spotted areas.

The star's brightness without spots (assuming no spots) would be L0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

But when spots are present, the brightness is L = L0 - L_spots + L_non_spots.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the brightness drops when spots are visible.

But when a planet transits, the brightness drops by the area of the planet relative to the star. So the problem is to find R_planet / R_star such that the dip is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

So the dip in brightness when the planet transits is (R_p / R_s)^2.

The dip caused by the spots when they are visible is the difference between the star's brightness when the spots are not blocking and when they are.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the star's overall brightness is less. The change in brightness would be proportional to the area of the spots and the temperature difference squared.

Wait, maybe I should model this as follows.

The star's luminosity is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

The spots have an area A = f * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

But the spots are cooler, with T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the luminosity of the spots is L_spots = A σ T_spot^4.

When the star is not rotating, and spots are on the far side, the apparent brightness is L0. When it's rotating so that the spots are visible, the brightness is L = L0 - L_spots + L_spots' , where L_spots' is the luminosity of the spots from our perspective.

Wait, no. Because the spots are on the near side, their contribution is less. So the total brightness would be L = L0 - (L_spot_area * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)).

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is the difference between the star without spots and the star with spots visible.

So the change in brightness, ΔL, is:

ΔL = (L0 - L_obs) = (L_spot_area) * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)

Because when the spots are on the near side, the spots emit less (T_spot < T_eff). So the star's brightness is less by this amount.

But wait, L_obs = L0 - L_spot_area*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) 

Wait, I think it's better to compute the fraction change in brightness when the spots are on the visible side.

The change in flux (ΔF) would be the difference between the flux when the spots are on the far side and when they're on the near side.

So when spots are on the far side, the flux is F0 = (L0) / (4π D^2), where D is distance.

But when spots are on the near side, the flux is F = (L0 - ΔL) / (4π D^2)

So the change in flux is ΔF = (ΔL) / (4π D^2)

But since we are looking for the fractional change, ΔF / F0 = ΔL / L0.

So ΔL is the difference between the whole star and the star with spots visible.

So ΔL = L_spot_area * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) 

Wait, because when spots are on the near side, the area of the spots contributes less to the total luminosity. The rest of the star (non-spots) is at T_eff, and the spots are at T_spot.

So the total luminosity when spots are visible is L0 - (L_spot_area) * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) = L0 - ΔL.

Wait, because L_spot_area at T_eff would be A σ T_eff^4, but since they're cooler, their actual luminosity is A σ T_spot^4. So the difference is A σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4), which is the loss in luminosity when the spots are present.

Thus, the change in luminosity is ΔL = A σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)

And the fractional change is ΔL / L0.

So the fractional change is:

( A σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ) / (4 π R^2 σ T_eff^4 )

Simplify:

= (A) / (4 π R^2) ) * ( (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4 )

A is 0.4 π R^2, as we computed earlier.

So plug that in:

= (0.4 π R^2) / (4 π R^2) ) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 )

Simplify:

(0.4 π R^2 / 4 π R^2) ) = 0.4 / 4 = 0.1.

So 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000)^4: 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.8333^2 is about 0.6944, squared again is around 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 ≈ 0.5177.

So the fractional change ΔF is 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, or about 5.177% change.

Wait, but wait. The star has spots on one hemisphere. So when it rotates, only part of the time are the spots visible. But the photometric time-series will show a periodic variation as the spots come into and out of view. The maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is on the near side.

Wait, but the problem says the star is observed as a disk, and the spot-covered hemisphere is facing us. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But the dip in brightness would be maximum when the entire spotted area is visible. So the maximum dip is 5.177%, but on average, the brightness variation would be this dip.

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would rotate in and out of view, causing a periodic dip each time a spot comes into view. But the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is on the near side. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.177%.

Wait, but the problem is to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in brightness variation. So when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, which should equal 0.05177.

So (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.05177 

Take square root: R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but that's about 0.228, which isn't one of the options. The options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area calculation. Let me go back.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Spots are 5000 K, so the temperature ratio is 5/6.

The area of the spots: the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the area covered is 20% of the hemisphere. Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4π R².

So the fraction of the star covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the correct area is 0.4 π R², which contributes 10% of the total surface. So then the fractional change in brightness when the spots are on the near side is:

ΔF = (A / A_star) * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4

Which is (0.4 π R² / 4 π R²) * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (625/1296)) 

Wait, 625/1296 is approximately 0.48225. So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775, same as before.

So the fractional change is about 5.18%, which would require a planet transit causing the same dip.

So for the planet, (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p / R_s ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm. I must have gone wrong somewhere. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the change in brightness is not just the area times the temperature difference. Because when the spots are on the far side, the light we receive is L0. When the spots are on the near side, the light we receive is L0 - A*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, no, I think that's correct because the spots contribute less. So the dip is the amount by which the luminosity drops when the spots are visible.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the dip as the difference in flux.

Flux from the star is F = L/(4π D²). When spots are on the near side, the flux is (L - ΔL)/(4π D²). So the change in flux is ΔL/(4π D²).

But the fractional change is (ΔL / L )= (A σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ) / (4 π R² σ T_eff^4 )

So yes, (A) is 0.4 π R², which makes (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= 0.1. Multiply by (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.5177, giving 0.05177.

So the dip is about 5.18%. So the planet's transit would have to cause the same dip. So R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

But none of the options are close to 0.23. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is for the maximum dip when the spots are fully on the near side, but the variation in brightness is only half that. Because when the star rotates, the spots would come in and out of view, leading to a variation where the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible. But the amplitude of the variation would be the difference between the star's brightness when spots are visible and when they're not. Wait no, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. Wait, no, the amplitude is the maximum dip, which is the same as the dip when all the spots are visible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the area of the spots. Let me re-check.

The problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area covered is 20% of the hemisphere.

Hemisphere area is 2 π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the total area of the spots is 0.4 π R². The star's total area is 4 π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, 10%.

So the area ratio is 0.1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in brightness as the product of the area fraction and the relative brightness per unit area.

So each spot has a brightness of (T_spot / T_eff )^4. So the fractional brightness per unit area is (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So the average brightness of the spotted area is 0.48225 times the brightness of the rest of the star.

So the total brightness when spots are visible is:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot

Where F0 is the brightness of the non-spotted area (assuming it's at T_eff), and F_spot is the brightness of the spots.

So F = (1 - 0.1) * F0 + 0.1 * 0.48225 * F0

= (0.9 + 0.048225) * F0 = 0.948225 F0.

So the brightness when spots are visible is 0.948225 F0. The brightness without spots is F0. So the dip is F0 - 0.948225 F0 = 0.051775 F0, which is a 5.1775% dip.

So that's the same as before.

So the planet's transit would cause the same dip if:

(R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm. 0.2275 isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the calculation should consider that the spots are on one hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only a portion of the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when half the spots are visible. Wait, no. If the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere, then as it rotates, the spots would become visible when that hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip would be when all the spots are on the near side, which is what I calculated.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the star's rotational period causes the spots to come into view only once per rotation, leading to a dip each time. So the maximum dip is 5.18%, and the planet's transit would have to cause the same dip.

But that would imply a planet radius of ~0.227 R_star, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the spots. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not of the hemisphere.

Wait, if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, the area would be 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

Then the fraction is 0.2, so the dip would be:

0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, or 10.35% dip.

Then the planet would need to have R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32. That's option D.

Ah! Maybe that's the correct approach. Maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not of the hemisphere.

Wait, the problem states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere, not the entire star. So the area is 0.2 * (2 π R^2) = 0.4 π R².

So the fraction is 0.4 π /4 π = 0.1, leading to a 5.17% dip.

But that doesn't match any option. So perhaps the problem is considering that the entire hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the entire star.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah! So the hemisphere is covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered is 0.4 π R² / (4 π R²) = 0.1, 10%.

But perhaps the calculation of the brightness dip is different. Let me think again.

Each spot has a lower brightness. The brightness from the spots is (T_spot / T_eff)^4 per unit area.

So the total brightness of the star when the spots are on the near side is:

L = L0 * (1 - f) + L0 * f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4

Where f is the total fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, which is 0.1.

So L = L0 (1 - 0.1 + 0.1 * (5/6)^4 )

= L0 (0.9 + 0.1 * (625/1296) )

625/1296 is approximately 0.48225.

So 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.48225 = 0.9 + 0.048225 = 0.948225.

So the brightness is 0.948225 L0, a dip of 5.1775% when the spots are visible.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

So the relative radius squared of the planet should be this dip.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm, but that's not any of the options. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness is based on the effective temperature, but when the spots are on the far side, and the star is rotating, the maximum brightness is when the spots are not visible, and the brightness dips when the spots are visible. So the amplitude is the difference between the two.

But in that case, the amplitude would be the dip, which is 5.18%.

So the planet's transit would need to have a dip of 5.18%, which requires R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is not just when the spots are on the near side, but also when other parts are visible.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the spots on the hemisphere cause a variation that's similar to a planet blocking part of the star. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the planet's.

But perhaps the calculation is done by considering the maximum change in brightness, which would be when the entire spotted area is on the near side. So the dip is 5.18%, as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the spots. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the entire hemisphere is covered by spots with a 20% filling factor. Wait, no. The problem says the hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So that filling factor is for the hemisphere.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So the fraction of the total area is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, 10%.

So the dip is 5.18%, leading to a planet radius of 0.2275.

But no options match. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the calculation should be done differently. Maybe the star's flux when spots are on the near side is less by (area of spots) * ( (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the brightness variation due to the spots is not the dip, but the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness as the star rotates, which would be 2 times the dip.

Wait, no. If the star's brightness when spots are on the near side is 0.948225 L0, and when spots are on the far side it's L0. So the variation would be L0 - 0.948225 L0 = 0.051775 L0. So the amplitude is 5.18%, not 10.35%.

So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's area is being considered as just the hemisphere. So when the spots are on the near side, the area blocking is 0.4 π R², but when the star is viewed from another angle, the area is zero. So the amplitude is 0.4 π R²/(4 π R²) ) * (1 - (5/6)^4 ), which is 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, 0.2275 is between 0.11 and 0.32. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Wait, perhaps the dip is calculated differently. Let me think: when the spots are on the near side, the total flux is ( (1 - f) * (T_eff^4) + f * (T_spot^4) ) / T_eff^4.

So the dip is 1 - [ (1 - f) + f*(T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ].

So dip is 1 - [ (1 - f) + f*( (5/6)^4 ) ]

= 1 - [ 1 - 0.1 + 0.1*(625/1296) ]

= 1 - [ 0.9 + 0.1*(0.48225) ]

= 1 - (0.9 + 0.048225) = 1 - 0.948225 = 0.051775.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the planet has to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the brightness variation caused by the spots. So the dip from the planet is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But that's not any of the options. So perhaps I made an error in the area calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the spots are on the hemisphere, but the hemisphere is only visible when the star is viewed edge-on. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but the hemisphere is only 50% of the star's surface. So perhaps the effective area is 0.2 * (2 π R²) * 0.5, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total change in flux when the spots are on the visible side.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation caused by the spots is the same as that caused by a planet transit. So:

(R_p / R_s)^2 = (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) )

Wait, A_spots is 0.4 π R².

A_star is 4 π R².

So:

(R_p / R_s)^2 = (0.4 π R² / 4 π R² ) * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - (625/1296)) 

= 0.1 * ( (1296 - 625) / 1296 )

= 0.1 * (671 / 1296 )

≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177.

So R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the planet is around that star, so R_p = x * R_star.

Wait, but the options are all less than 1, which makes sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that when the star is viewed, the spots are on the far side, so the observed brightness is higher, but when they rotate into view, the brightness drops. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are on the near side, but the average brightness variation is the average of the dip and the normal brightness. No, I think the dip is the peak-to-peak variation.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the maximum brightness variation (i.e., the peak dip) caused by the spots and set it equal to the planet's transit dip.

But that's what I've been doing, and it's giving me 0.2275, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on the hemisphere, but the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but only half the time. So the average brightness would be lower, but the amplitude would be the dip when spots are present.

Wait, but the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is on the near side. So that's the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. Suppose the correct answer is around 0.0518, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the spots as causing a brightness variation of (area of spots) * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 ), but then that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the spot's area and the star's area.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is viewed, the spots are on one hemisphere, so the maximum area of spots that can be on the near side is 20% of that hemisphere. So when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots are on the limb, so their contribution to the brightness is less. But I don't think that affects the calculation of the maximum dip.

Wait, maybe I should use the blackbody formula for flux, considering each spot.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots modulating as the star rotates, but the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness. So when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is maximum, and when on the near side, brightness is minimum.

So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible: F_max = F0.

The minimum brightness is when all the spots are visible: F_min = F0 - ΔL.

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / 2.

Wait, no. The amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_min. So if F_max is F0 and F_min is F0 - ΔL, then the amplitude is ΔL.

But the dip is ΔL / F0. So dip is 5.18%.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is 2 times the dip, because it goes from F0 to F0 - ΔL, so the amplitude is ΔL, but the dip is ΔL / F0.

No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of percentages.

If F_max is F0 and F_min is 0.948225 F0, then the amplitude is F_max - F_min = 0.051775 F0, which is a 5.18% dip. So the amplitude is 5.18% of F0.

So the planet's transit must cause the same amplitude in the brightness. So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_s)^2 F0, which must equal 0.051775 F0.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the planet's radius as a fraction of the star's radius, but the star's radius is same as Sun, which is R_sun. But the planet is around that star, not the Sun.

Wait, no, that's what we've been doing.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the ratio as (R_p / R_s)^2 = ( (A_spots) / (A_star) ) * ( (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ) / T_eff^4 )

Which is (0.4 π R² / 4 π R² ) * ( (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Compute 6000^4 is (6^4)*1e12? Wait, 6000^4 = (6^4) * (1000^4) )= 1296e12, and 5000^4 is 625e12.

So 6000^4 - 5000^4 = 1296e12 - 625e12 = 671e12.

So (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) / 6000^4 = 671e12 / 1296e12 ≈ 0.5177.

So (0.4 π R² / 4 π R² ) = 0.1, so 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177.

So again, (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a partial area. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible, but perhaps the average dip is when half the spots are visible. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to rotate into view, and the brightness variation is the same as a planet blocking part of the star. But that's what we've been considering.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the brightness variation due to the spots is being compared to the planet's transit, but the star's rotation period is such that the spots are only visible for a certain fraction of the time. But I don't think that affects the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, 0.11 squared is 0.0121, which is much smaller than 0.05177.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (5/6)^4. Let me recalculate.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is comparing the brightness variation to the star's total luminosity, including the spots. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are only on the hemisphere, so the maximum area that can be blocked is half the spots' area. So when the star rotates, the spots are on the near side, but only half the spots are visible at any time. So the area is 0.2 * (π R²) instead of 0.4 π R².

Wait, if the hemisphere is covered with 20% spots, and when the star rotates, we can see up to 50% of that hemisphere. So the maximum area visible is 0.2 * (π R²), which is 0.2 * 3.1416 R² ≈ 0.6283 R².

Then the area ratio is 0.6283 R² / (4 π R²) ) = 0.6283 / 12.566 ≈ 0.05, or 5%.

So the dip would be 0.05 * 0.51775 = 0.0258875, which is about 2.588% dip.

Then the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.0258875) ≈ 0.1608, which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is being done for the area of the hemisphere, not the entire star.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, so when the spots are on the near side, the area is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the entire star. So the same as before.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the temperature difference's square instead of the fourth power. Wait, no, because the Stefan-Boltzmann law is T^4 proportional to flux.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K, but perhaps the calculation should use T_spot = Teff - 1000, which is 5000 K. But I think I've done that correctly.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on the hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the spots are only partially visible, leading to a varying dip. So perhaps the maximum dip is when half the spots are visible. But that would be a smaller dip.

Wait, if the maximum dip is when half the spots are visible, then the dip would be 0.051775 / 2 ≈ 0.0258875, leading to R_p/R_s ≈ 0.1608, which is about 0.16, which is closer to option C) ~0.11.

But that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the planet's radius is calculated based on the average dip.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should go with the calculation I did, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the planet's radius is relative to the star's radius, so let's compute using numbers.

Let me compute the dip again numerically.

Teff = 6000 K.

T_spot = 5000 K.

A_spots = 20% of the hemisphere's area. Hemisphere area = 2 π R².

A_spots = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Fraction of star's area covered: 0.4 π R² / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1.

So dip in brightness is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm. So none of the options match. Perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on the hemisphere, but the calculation should be based on the brightness of the entire hemisphere. So the area of the hemisphere is 2 π R². The brightness of the hemisphere without spots would be 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4. With spots, it's 0.8 π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, so the brightness of the hemisphere is:

L_hemi = (0.8 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The brightness when the hemisphere is on the far side is L0 = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the hemisphere is on the near side, the brightness is L = L0 / 2 (since it's a hemisphere) minus the spots' contribution.

Wait, no, because the star emits uniformly except for the spots. So when the hemisphere without spots is on the near side, the brightness is (2 π R²) * σ (6000)^4. When the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, the brightness is (0.8 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, so the brightness when the hemisphere is spotted is:

L_spotted_hemi = 0.8 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² σ (5000)^4.

The brightness when the other hemisphere is visible (no spots) is L_hemi = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the dip when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

ΔL = L_hemi - L_spotted_hemi = [2 π R² σ 6000^4 ] - [0.8 π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.2 π R² σ 5000^4 ]

= [ (2 - 0.8) π R² σ 6000^4 ] - [ 0.2 π R² σ 5000^4 ]

= (1.2 π R² σ 6000^4 ) - (0.2 π R² σ 5000^4 )

= π R² σ [ 1.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ].

The total star's luminosity when the unspotted hemisphere is on the near side is L = 2 π R² σ 6000^4.

Wait, I think this approach is getting too complicated. Let me try to compute the dip in brightness.

L_hemi = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

L_spotted_hemi = 0.8 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the dip is L_hemi - L_spotted_hemi = 2 π R² σ 6000^4 - [0.8 π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.2 π R² σ 5000^4 ]

= (2 - 0.8) π R² σ 6000^4 - 0.2 π R² σ 5000^4 

= 1.2 π R² σ 6000^4 - 0.2 π R² σ 5000^4.

Factor out π R² σ:

= π R² σ (1.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 )

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So:

1.2 * 1296e12 = 1555.2e12.

0.2 * 625e12 = 125e12.

So 1555.2e12 - 125e12 = 1430.2e12.

So dip = π R² σ * 1430.2e12.

The total brightness when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is 2 π R² σ (6000)^4 = 2 π R² σ 1296e12.

So the fractional dip is dip / L_hemi = [ π R² σ *1430.2e12 ] / [ 2 π R² σ 1296e12 ]

Simplify: (1430.2e12) / (2 * 1296e12 ) ≈ 1430.2 / (2592) ≈ 0.5513.

So the fractional dip is 55.13%.

Wait, that can't be right because the star's total brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be much lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, L_hemi is 2 π R² σ (6e3)^4 = 2 π R² σ 1296e12.

L_spotted_hemi is 0.8 π R² σ (6e3)^4 + 0.2 π R² σ (5e3)^4 = 0.8 π R² σ 1296e12 + 0.2 π R² σ 625e12.

So L_spotted_hemi = π R² σ [ 0.8 * 1296e12 + 0.2 *625e12 ]

= π R² σ [ 1036.8e12 + 125e12 ] = π R² σ (1161.8e12 )

L_hemi is 2 π R² σ 1296e12 = 2592 π R² σ e12.

So the dip is L_hemi - L_spotted_hemi = 2592e12 π R² σ - 1161.8e12 π R² σ = (2592 - 1161.8) e12 π R² σ = 1430.2e12 π R² σ.

So the fractional dip is 1430.2e12 / 2592e12 = 1430.2 / 2592 ≈ 0.5513, or 55.13%.

That's a huge dip, which doesn't make sense because the spots are only 10% of the star's surface. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the brightness when the spotted hemisphere is on the near side to when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is on the near side. But the star's total brightness is always the same when considering the entire star. The problem arises when only part of the star is observed, which is the case when the star is a disk, not a point source. So perhaps the approach is more about how the brightness varies as the star rotates, not the total luminosity.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck and time is limited. Based on my initial calculations, the correct answer should be around 0.23, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, but how? Let me think: perhaps the calculation should be (R_p/R_s)^2 = (f) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 )

With f being 0.2 (20% filling factor on the entire star), not 0.1.

So 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

Then R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is option D) ~0.32.

Ah! So perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

So the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

Then R_p/R_s ≈ 0.3217, which is option D).

Therefore, the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation caused by the spots depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.
   - The fractional change in brightness (\( \Delta F \)) is given by:
     \[
     \Delta F = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
     This must match the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots.

3. **Spot Area and Fraction**:
   - The hemisphere's surface area is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The area covered by spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \, \text{(10%)}.
     \]

4. **Brightness Dip Calculation**:
   - The fractional change in brightness due to the spots is:
     \[
     \Delta F = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 = 0.051775 \, \text{(5.18%)}.
     \]

5. **Exoplanet Radius Calculation**:
   - The dip caused by the exoplanet must match the dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \Delta F = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (~0.39)**: Too large; corresponds to a much larger dip than calculated.
- **Option B (~0.07)**: Too small; corresponds to a much smaller dip than calculated.
- **Option C (~0.11)**: Does not match the calculated value of \( 0.2275 \).
- **Option D (~0.32)**: Closest to the calculated value of \( 0.2275 \), assuming the problem interprets the filling factor differently (e.g., as 20% of the entire star rather than the hemisphere).

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the calculations, the most reasonable choice is **Option D (~0.32)**, as it aligns with the interpretation that the filling factor applies to the entire star rather than just the hemisphere.

Answer: D
