Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem says the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The components of P are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is ħ/2 times a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the total operator P would be the vector sum of its components: P = Px * x-hat + Py * y-hat + Pz * z-hat. But wait, no, the direction is given as an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So maybe the operator isn't in the lab frame but along this direction n. Hmm, but the given components are in the x, y, z directions. So perhaps I need to express P along the direction n.

Alternatively, maybe the operator in the direction n is P · n, which would be (Px n_x + Py n_y + Pz n_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator we're considering is P · n = Px n_x + Pz n_z.

Wait, but the problem says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So I think it's asking for the eigenvector of the operator P when it's projected along direction n. So that operator would be (P · n), and we want its eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm, but how do I approach this? Maybe I should first find the matrix representation of the operator P · n. Because each component (Px, Py, Pz) is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I can write each component as a matrix and then combine them with the direction vector n.

Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so it can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but I'm not entirely
