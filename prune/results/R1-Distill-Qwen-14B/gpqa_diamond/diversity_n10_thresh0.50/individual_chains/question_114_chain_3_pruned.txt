Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem has two parts. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism probably involves the enolate formation or something like that.

Wait, no, wait. For a ketone reacting with CN-, I think it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. The ketone's carbonyl is attacked by the cyanide. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Or wait, let me draw it. No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which upon adding CN- would form (CH3)2C(O-)CN. But then, under certain conditions, that would protonate. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CNCH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, maybe the product structure is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Or perhaps I need to think differently. Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, the formula would be C5H9NO. Let me count: butan-2-one is C4H8O. Adding CN (which is C and N) would give an increase in carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing
