Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D, which are various distances in meters.

Wait, meson decay... I remember that particles like mesons and baryons can decay into other particles, and their decay properties depend on their lifetimes or mean proper lifetime, which relates to their energy and mass. Oh right, the mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So that would be the product of the particle's velocity and its mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find the mean lifetime? I think the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, and τ is the inverse of Γ multiplied by some constants. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I might be mixing up things. Let me get the formula right.

The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, in natural units, ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So I'll need to use that.

Wait, the problem gives Γ in MeV. I should convert that to GeV. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute that.

But wait, the meson's velocity is important here too. The mean decay distance is L = βγ c τ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor. So I need to find β and γ for this meson.

How do I find β and γ? Well, the energy E of the particle is given. The mass is m. The relation between energy, mass, and momentum is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So let me compute the momentum first.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, in natural units where c=1, the equation simplifies. So E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2). Let's calculate that.

E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV.

p^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV (since sqrt(62.56) is around 7.91).

So p ≈ 7.91 GeV. Now, β is p c / (E c) * c, but wait, since in natural units c=1, β = p/E. So β = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

Then, γ is E/(m c²) in natural units, so γ = E/m. E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, so γ = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So putting it all together, L = β γ c τ.

Wait, what's c? Approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Now, let's compute τ first. τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that again. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is the same as 6.582 / 0.32 multiplied by 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, L = β γ c τ.

β is approximately 0.98875, γ is ≈6.6667. So βγ = 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6 (exact calc later maybe).

Wait, let's compute this more accurately. 0.98875 * 6.6666667.

0.98875 *6 = 5.9325, 0.98875 *0.6666667≈0.6591666. So total is about 5.9325 + 0.6591≈6.5916.

So βγ ≈6.5916.

So L = βγ c τ.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L=6.5916 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers step by step.

First, 6.5916 * 3e8 = 1.97748e9.

Then, 1.97748e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Multiply 1.97748e9 *2.056875e-24 = 1.97748 * 2.056875 = approx 4.065, and the exponents are 1e9 *1e-24=1e-15.

So 4.065e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, that's option B (4.0655e-15 m) or option C (5.0223e-15 m).

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation earlier. Let me redo the calculations more precisely.

Let me re-calculate β and γ.

E = 8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV.

Compute p: sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 - (1.44)) = sqrt(62.56). Let me compute sqrt(62.56). Well, 7.91^2 is 62.56 because 7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.91^2 is (7.9 +0.01)^2=7.9² + 2*7.9*0.01 + (0.01)^2=62.41 +0.158 +0.0001=62.5681. Close enough, so p=7.91 GeV.

β = p/E = 7.91/8 = 0.98875.

γ = E/(m c²) → in natural units, c=1, so γ= E/m = 8/1.2 = 6.666666... ≈6.6667.

βγ = 0.98875 * 6.6667.

Let me compute that more accurately:

6.6667 * 0.98875.

Break it down: 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325, 0.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.6591666.

Adding them gives 5.9325 +0.6591666≈6.591666.

So βγ ≈6.591666.

Now, τ: ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ=0.32 GeV.

τ= 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, L=βγ c τ.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

L = 6.591666 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 6.591666 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9.

Then, 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 *2.056875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.9775 *2.056875.

Let's calculate that:

2 *2.056875=4.11375.

But 1.9775 is 2 -0.0225.

So 1.9775 *2.056875= (2 -0.0225)*2.056875 = 2*2.056875 -0.0225*2.056875.

2*2.056875=4.11375.

0.0225 *2.056875 = approx 0.046284375.

So subtract: 4.11375 -0.046284375=4.067465625.

So approximately 4.0674656e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives ~4.067e-15, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial values.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mean decay length.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the decay length is L = c * τ * β γ.

But perhaps I can compute it as L = (c * τ) * β γ.

Wait, yes, that's the same as I did before.

Alternatively, another formula is L = (E * τ * c)/m. Because E=γ m c², so γ= E/(m c²). So β γ c τ = (v/c) * (E/(m c²)) * c τ. Hmm, but I think that would still give the same result.

Wait, another approach: the mean proper lifetime is τ = ħ/(Γ). Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ' = γ τ. The speed is v = β c. So the mean distance is L= v * τ' = β c γ τ.

Which is what I used.

Wait, let me recompute the precise value of 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 1.9775e9 is 1.9775 * 1e9.

Wait, 1e9 *1e-24 =1e-15.

So 1.9775 * 2.056875 = ?

Let me compute:

1.9775 * 2 =3.955

1.9775 * 0.056875= ?

Wait, 1.9775 * 0.05=0.098875.

1.9775 *0.006875=?

Hmm, 1.9775 *0.006 =0.011865

1.9775 *0.000875= approx 1.7293125e-3.

So 0.011865 + 0.0017293125≈0.0135943125.

So 0.098875 +0.0135943125=0.1124693125.

So total 3.955 +0.1124693125 ≈4.0674693125.

So that's about 4.0674693e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The difference might be due to more precise values of the constants.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ and c.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, but maybe more accurately, 6.5823×10^-25 GeV·s.

But using the given numbers:

Γ=320 MeV=0.32 GeV.

So τ=6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's be precise.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 /0.32: 0.32 *20 =6.4, so 20.56875.

Wait, 0.32 *20.56875=6.582.

Yes, so 20.56875e-25=2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, βγ is 6.591666.

So L=6.591666 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 3*2.056875 =6.170625e-16.

Then, 6.591666 *6.170625e-16 = ?

6.591666 *6.170625.

Let me compute:

6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.591666 *6.170625.

0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.091666 *6.170625≈0.5656.

Wait, 0.091666 is approx 11/120.

But 6.170625 * 0.091666 = approx 0.5656.

So 3.0853125 +0.5656 = 3.6509125.

So total 37.02375 +3.6509125≈40.6746625.

So 40.6746625 × 1e-16=4.06746625e-15 m.

So about 4.067e-15 m.

The options have option B as 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So I think option B is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check if I messed up any steps.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma and beta.

Wait, another way to compute gamma: E = gamma m c². Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, gamma=8/(1.2)=6.666..., correct.

Beta is v/c, which is (p c)/(E c) → p c is (7.91 GeV) * c; E c is (8 GeV) *c. So beta is (7.91 GeV c) / (8 GeV c) =7.91/8≈0.98875, correct.

Another thing: I used the width as 0.32 GeV, but wait, the meson's width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, correct.

Another point: when calculating the mean lifetime, tau is hbar / (Gamma). But wait, in some contexts, the total decay width is related to the lifetime as Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau= ħ / Gamma.

Yes, that's correct.

So the only possible mistake I can think of is perhaps using the decay width as the uncertainty in energy, but in this case, it's correct.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean lifetime, with \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma \) being the total decay width.

### Step 1: Compute the momentum \( p \)
The energy-momentum-mass relation is given by:

\[
E^2 = p^2 + m^2
\]

Given \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), we solve for \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
- \( \beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875 \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667 \).

Thus, \( \beta \gamma = 0.98875 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.591666 \).

### Step 3: Compute the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The total decay width is \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substitute into \( L = \beta \gamma c \tau \):

\[
L = 6.591666 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( 6.591666 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9775 \times 10^9 \). Then:

\[
L = 1.9775 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 4.06746625 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The closest value to \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding of constants or intermediate values.

**Answer: B**
