Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars based on their properties. Alright, I remember that luminosity for stars is related to their radius and temperature. Oh wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

So the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, their masses are in the same ratio, but wait, does mass matter here? I mean, the question is about luminosity based on blackbody radiation, so probably the mass isn't directly relevant unless it's affecting something else like temperature. But the problem doesn't mention anything about mass affecting temperature, so maybe I can ignore mass for now.

The next part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. 

Wait, but then if their temperatures are the same, then the luminosity ratio depends only on the radius ratio. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same for both. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. 

But wait, the options include 2.25 (option A) and others that are higher. Hmm, but wait, the problem also mentions something about radial velocities. Let me think. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Oh, but how does that affect luminosity? Wait, no, luminosity is intrinsic brightness, not related to velocity. Maybe I'm getting confused because sometimes Doppler shift affects observed brightness, but in this case, the question says they computed the luminosities as black bodies. So perhaps I should ignore the radial velocities for the luminosity calculation.
