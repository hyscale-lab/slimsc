Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the given options.

First, let's look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting material. The NMR peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as singlets. A triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Oh, maybe it's an alpha-proton to an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's a vinylogous system? Or maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to some coupling.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. But the triplet might not fit that. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde group with adjacent substituents? Or maybe a conjugated system where the proton is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

Looking at the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. The 6.98 is probably the protons ortho to a substituent, and 6.51 the other two. But wait, wait, in para substitution, each pair of protons would be a doublet. So maybe two benzene rings? Or perhaps one benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=
