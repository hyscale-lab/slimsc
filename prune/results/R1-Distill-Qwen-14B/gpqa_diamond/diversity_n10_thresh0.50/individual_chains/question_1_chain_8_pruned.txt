Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state would be on the order of that lifetime, right? So the energy uncertainty for each state is ħ over (2 * lifetime). Because Δt is roughly the lifetime, since that's the time over which the state exists.

But wait, the question is about distinguishing two states. So I think we need to make sure that the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the combined uncertainties, the two energies would overlap, making it impossible to distinguish.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Each state has its own uncertainty in energy. To resolve the two states, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or perhaps each has an uncertainty, and the minimal detectable difference
