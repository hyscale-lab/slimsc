Okay, so I have this question about crystallography here, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Wait, for a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance is straightforward with the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and the indices are h, k, l. But this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal crystal, right?

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a form of crystal system, more like a cube but with all edges equal but angles not 90 degrees. Oh right, so in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but in this case, since it's a rhombohedral, a = b = c, and all the angles are equal. So it's a special case where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma.

So for a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is a bit more complicated. I think the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h
