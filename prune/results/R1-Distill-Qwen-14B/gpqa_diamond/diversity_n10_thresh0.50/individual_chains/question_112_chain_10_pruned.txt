Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So I'll need to find the normalization constant.

Wait, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Oh, that's an interesting operator. Let me think about what that implies. So in matrix form, it would be a 2x2 matrix, right? Because |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-component of spin, which is two-dimensional.

So the matrix A would be:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero (since A_ij is 0 when i=j) and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So that's like a spin-flip operator, maybe the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if we multiply by hbar/2, we get this A.

Now, the operator in question is this A, so to find the expectation value, I need to compute <alpha| A |alpha> divided by the normalization, but wait, the state is already normalized as |alpha> is proportional, so after normalization, it's a unit vector.

But first, let's normalize the state. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute the norm squared. The norm squared is the inner product with itself.

So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Similarly, |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. The cross terms are (1+i)(2 -i)* and (2 -i)(1+i)*, but wait, when taking the inner product, it's (a + b)(a* + b*)?

Wait, no. The inner product is the sum of the products of the coefficients. So for |a|^2 + |b|^2 + terms... Wait, the state is |a> = a|up> + b|down>, so |a|^2 is |a|^2 + |b|^2 + a b*<up|down> + b a*<down|up>.

But since <up|down> is zero because they are orthogonal, the norm squared is just |a|^2 + |b|^2. So for |alpha>, a is (1+i), b is (2−i).

So |a|^2 is |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, and |b|² is |2−i|² = (2)^2 + (−1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> becomes (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, all divided by sqrt(7).

Now, the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. Wait, but operator A is given, and its eigenstates would be the basis for which it's diagonal. Since A is [[0, h/2],[h/2, 0]], which is h/2 times the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvalues ± h/2.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), if I remember
