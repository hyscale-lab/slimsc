Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that the eigenvalues of angular momentum components are related to the spin. Since a muon is a spin-1/2 particle, the possible eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2 multiplied by some factor. But wait, let me think again. Oh wait, the operator here is Ay. The standard Pauli matrices for spin are σx, σy, σz, but wait, S is for spin-1/2. So each component S would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Or wait, no, wait: the operator for S here is a 2x2 matrix given, which looks like the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So in this case, S is the Pauli Y matrix. Because the matrix S is given as first row (0, -i), second (i, 0), which is exactly the Pauli Y matrix. So, S = σy.

So the operator Ay is c times σy. And c is h/(4π). Wait, but what is h here? Planck's constant. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, ħ is h/(2π). So let me compute c: c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

Wait no, wait: h is Planck's constant, so ħ = h/(2π). So c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) / 2 = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of σy are ±i. Because σy is the Pauli matrix, and its eigenvalues are i and -i. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times those eigenvalues. So Ay has eigenvalues (ħ/2) * i and (ħ/2) * (-i). So the eigenvalues are ±i ħ/2. But wait, the question is about the eigenvalues a. So what are the eigenvalues a?

Wait, let me think again. The operator Ay is c * S, where S is σy. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. The eigenvalues of S (σy) are ±i. So the eigenvalues are c*(±i) = (ħ/2)(±i) = ± i ħ/2.

But wait, the question says the matrix operator is Ay = c·S, where S is a 2x2 matrix as given. So, to find the eigenvalues, I have to find the eigenvalues of Ay.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the characteristic equation of Ay to find the eigenvalues. Let me try that.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So Ay = c * S = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. So the matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. To find the eigenvalues, we set up the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - a I is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]. The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) ). Let's compute that.

(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = ( (-i)(i) ) c². i * (-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So (-i)(i) is 1. So (-i c)(i c) = c² * (1) = c². So determinant equation is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues a are ±c.

Wait, but wait. I thought the eigenvalues of S (σy) are ±i. Because σy is the Pauli matrix, and its eigenvalues are ±i. So if Ay = c S, then eigenvalues are c*(±i). But according to this calculation, the eigenvalues are ±c.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me recompute.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. The eigenvalues are found by det( [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]] ) = 0.

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) ). So that's a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ].

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². Multiply (-i) and i: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (1) c².

So det = a² - (1 c²) = a² - c². So a² = c² → a = ±c.

But earlier I thought the eigenvalues would be c times the eigenvalues of S. S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±i. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (±i). So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate. Let me find the eigenvalues of S=σy. The matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0 → [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]] → determinant is λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) → λ² - ( (-i^2) ) → λ² - ( -(-1) ) because i^2 is -1. So λ² - (1) = 0 → λ² =1 → λ= ±1. Wait, that's different. So wait, the eigenvalues of S are ±1? But I thought they are ±i.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±i for σy. Wait, no, no, wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but their trace is zero, determinant is -1, etc. But wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? So σx, σy, σz are Hermitian. So their eigenvalues should be real. Oh wait, but wait, if S is σy, then its eigenvalues are ±1. But that doesn't make sense because I thought σy has eigenvalues with imaginary values. Oh, no, wait, no. No, the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. Because when you compute the eigenvalues, they are real. Because the matrices are Hermitian. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me compute the eigenvalues of S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix is anti-Hermitian, because S† = -S. Wait, let me check: S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -S. So S is anti-Hermitian, which means that iS is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues of S are imaginary.

Wait, but when I computed the determinant, I got λ² - 1 =0, so eigenvalues ±1. Which are real. But that can't be right because the matrix isn't Hermitian. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the determinant correctly. Let's do it again. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the characteristic equation is:

det(S - λ I) = det( [ [-λ, -i], [i, -λ] ] )

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - 1.

So the eigenvalues are λ² =1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, but S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute its trace and determinant. The trace is 0, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = - ( -i^2 ) = - ( -(-1) ) = -(1) = -1. So the trace is 0, determinant is -1. So the eigenvalues are λ^2 = determinant, but wait no, wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the product of eigenvalues is the determinant. So with trace zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if the product is -1, the eigenvalues must be λ and -λ, such that λ*(-λ) = -λ² = determinant, which is -1. So λ² =1 → λ=±1. So yes, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, but that's confusing because I thought the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±i. Hmm, no, because the Pauli matrices are different. Wait, no, Pauli σy is the same as this matrix. Let me check. Oh wait, no. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as S here. And I thought the eigenvalues are ±i. But according to this calculation, they're ±1. So where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait a second. Because when I compute the eigenvalues of σy, I must have made a mistake. Let me try to compute the eigenvectors. Suppose I have a vector (a, b). S acting on it gives (0*a + (-i)*b, i*a + 0*b) = (-i b, i a). So for eigenvalues, we have (-i b, i a) = λ (a, b).

So:

-i b = λ a,

i a = λ b.

From the first equation: λ a = -i b → a = (-i b) / λ.

From the second equation: i a = λ b → substituting a from above: i [ (-i b)/λ ] = λ b → [ i (-i) / λ ] b = λ b.

i*(-i) is (-i^2) = 1. So (1/λ) b = λ b → 1/λ = λ → λ² =1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are ±1. So I was wrong before, the eigenvalues are ±1, not ±i.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier knowledge. Oh wait, no, no. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, their eigenvalues must be real. Because any Hermitian matrix has real eigenvalues. So σy is Hermitian? Let me check. S† is the conjugate transpose. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not equal to S. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. So S is not equal to S†, so S is not Hermitian. But wait, earlier I thought that Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Did I get that wrong?

Wait, no. Let me check. The Pauli Y matrix is indeed Hermitian. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So why isn't S equal to its conjugate transpose?

Wait, wait, looking again: the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is the same as the original matrix? No, because the (1,2) element is -i, and in the conjugate transpose it's i. So the (1,2) element is i, and (2,1) is -i. So S is not equal to S†. So S is not Hermitian. Which contradicts what I thought about Pauli matrices.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in defining S. Oh wait, no, the Pauli matrices are known to be Hermitian. Let me double-check. The Pauli Y matrix is defined as σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as σy. Because σy is Hermitian. Wait, no, wait, no: no, wait, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as σy. Because (0, -i) becomes (0, i) in the transpose, but then conjugated to (0, i becomes -i?), no. Wait, wait, no. Let me compute the conjugate transpose of σy:

σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The conjugate of each element: 0 remains 0, -i becomes i. i becomes -i, 0 remains 0.

Then transpose the matrix. So the conjugate transpose is:

Row 1: [0, i].

Row 2: [-i, 0].

Which is:

[[0, i],
 [-i, 0]]

Which is the same as σy. No, wait no. Wait, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and the conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as σy. So σy is anti-Hermitian? Because σy† = -σy. Let me see: σy† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -σy because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So yes, σy† = -σy, meaning σy is anti-Hermitian. So that's the case.

Wait, but that can't be, because I thought the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So where is the confusion? Ah, I think I might have mixed up the factors. Because sometimes the Pauli matrices are defined with an i factor. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are indeed Hermitian. So perhaps in this problem, S is not the same as the Pauli matrix. Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should not get stuck here but proceed. S is the given matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues, as per calculation, are ±1. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So when we take Ay = c*S, where c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2, as I computed earlier. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c*(±1) → ±c.

So the eigenvalues a are ±c, which is ±(h/(4π)).

Looking at the options now.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or ±… Wait, no, because the eigenvalues are real? Wait, wait, eigenvalues of S are ±1, so eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which is real numbers. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real, not complex. So the statement that the eigenvalues have an imaginary part is incorrect.

Option B: The imaginary part is ±1/2, real ±1. If c is h/(4π), then if h is Planck's constant, but perhaps the problem uses ħ? Wait, in the problem, c is given as h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±c = ±(h/(4π)). That's a real number. So options A and B are talking about eigenvalues with imaginary parts, but the correct answer must be real. So options A and B are incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Let's think. A² would be the square of the angular momentum operator, which for spin-1/2 would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 * 3 (since for spin s, A² = ħ² s(s+1)). Wait no, for spin 1/2, s=1/2, so A² eigenvalues are (ħ^2)( (1/2)(1/2 +1)) )= (3/4) ħ². So the eigenfunctions of A² are the same as those for any component, because A² commutes with each component. So the eigenfunctions of Ay should also be eigenfunctions of A². Because A² commutes with Ay. So option C says that φ is eigenfunction of A², which is correct. But the second part says that φ is not an eigenfunction of Az. But actually, the eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis where they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, what's that mean? The basis functions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis. But the statement seems a bit unclear. Are the eigenfunctions the same as the basis? Well, any basis can be formed by the eigenvectors, so perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So for the eigenvalues: in our calculation, the eigenvalues are ±c, which are real. So options A and B are wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, because A² commutes with Ay. So the same functions are eigenfunctions of both. But they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions can't be the same. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis of the matrix operator. Well, in 2x2, the eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis. So D is correct. Because the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So D is correct.

Wait, but which options are correct? The question says, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, eigenfunctions form a basis, so this is correct.

So which options are correct? The correct options would be C and D?

Wait, but looking at the options:

Only one option is correct, right?

Hmm.

So, in our problem, the eigenfunctions of Ay can indeed be eigenfunctions of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So for any eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A². So C is correct.

As for D, the statement is that the eigenfunctions form the basis of the operator. Well, any set of eigenvectors that are linearly independent and span the space would form a basis. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, if it has two distinct eigenvalues, it is diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are exclusive, so only one can be correct.

Wait, let's re-look at the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct because Ay and A² commute. So eigenvectors of Ay are eigenvectors of A². But they don't commute with Az, so they are not eigenvectors of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I think this is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct as well.

But the options are in the question, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis for the matrix.

But let me think about the statements.

Statement C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Yes, since A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az does not commute with Ay, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Statement D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, any 2x2 matrix has a basis of eigenvectors if it's diagonalizable. Since Ay has two distinct eigenvalues (since c is non-zero), it is diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So both options C and D are correct? But that can't be because it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Looking again at option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, perhaps the wording is trying to say that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which they do. So D is correct.

So conflict arises between C and D being correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me think about the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. So this is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions form the basis of the matrix operator. Well, yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But the options are presented as four different choices.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Another approach: perhaps the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2), because earlier I thought that S has eigenvalues ±i, but that's not the case here. Because in this problem, S is given as [[0, -i],[i,0]], which has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, no, because the calculation shows the eigenvalues are ±1 for S. So Ay = c*S, so eigenvalues are ±c. So Ay's eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π).

Which is a real number. So when looking at the options, options A and B suggest complex eigenvalues, so they are out.

So now, the real eigenvalues are ±c, where c = h/(4π). So which of the options C and D are correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are shared. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space. So D is correct.

But the options may have only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to look for other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions can't be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that. So in the options, the correct answers are C and D.

Wait, but the options are given as four, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Let me think about each option.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh or ±... No, eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Similarly, B is wrong.

Option C: Correct.

Option D: Correct.

But in the options, D is presented as a statement, which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But perhaps the question is about which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So when computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Let me think: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator.

Wait, the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

But since the question allows for four options, perhaps the correct option is C and D.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think again.

Another approach: when you have a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis. So D is correct.

But the option says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Yes, because the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis.

So D is correct.

So now, both C and D are correct.

But the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

So both statements are correct. But the options are presented as four, each offering a single statement.

Hmm, but the options can't both be correct. I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the matrix S.

Wait, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are ±1. So Ay = c S = (h/(4π)) * S. So the eigenvalues are c * 1 and c * (-1), which are (h/(4π)) and -(h/(4π)), which are real numbers.

So the eigenvalues are real.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay. So any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A². But it's not an eigenvector of Az because Az and Ay don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct.

But the options are presented as four, each being a separate statement. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not necessarily of Az. So C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me think again.

If the operator Ay has eigenvalues ±c, which are real, the eigenfunctions are orthogonal. So the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct.

Thus, in the options given, the correct statements are C and D.

But the options are separate, so I must choose which one is correct.

Wait, the question says, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So perhaps during the calculation, we find that the eigenfunctions form a basis, which is statement D.

Alternatively, perhaps C is correct because the eigenfunctions are shared with A².

But given that the question is about the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, perhaps both C and D are correct.

But I can't have both. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D, but in the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, the question is about the correct statement during the calculation, which would involve finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, you find the eigenfunctions, which form a basis, so D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the actual process.

When you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find that the eigenvalues are ±c, real. The eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis, so D is correct. So, the correct statements during the calculation are that D is correct.

But wait, the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², so C is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which is true.

So, I'll go with option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). This was confirmed by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \), leading to \( \lambda^2 = 1 \), so \( \lambda = \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real numbers.

2. **Option A and B:**
   - Both options suggest that the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) have imaginary parts, which is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)). Thus, **A and B are incorrect**.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This statement is **correct**.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space because the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent and span the space. Thus, **D is also correct**.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for a single correct statement, the focus is on the key insight during the calculation. Option C highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is a critical property during the eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation. Therefore, **C is the most appropriate answer**.

### Conclusion:

The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
