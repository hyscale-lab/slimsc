Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in non-relativistic mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when the potential energy is entirely converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are a bit more complicated.

The question states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. I'm to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given as A to D, each involving c, k, m, and A.

Wait, in the relativistic scenario, the energy equations change. In the non-relativistic case, maximum speed would be when all potential energy is kinetic. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic case, which is option C. But this is a relativistic problem, so option C can't be the correct one.

In relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The oscillator's total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential energies. But wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. No, the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1
