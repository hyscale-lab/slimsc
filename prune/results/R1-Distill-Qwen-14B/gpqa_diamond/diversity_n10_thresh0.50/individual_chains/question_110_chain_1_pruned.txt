Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, I remember that. 

Let me first look at the information given. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter than 17? Or less than? Oh, because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So if a star has a V magnitude lower than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. So ESPRESSO observes stars with V ≤ 17 mag. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. So that's the condition.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude needs to be ≤ 16 mag. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 for HIRES to detect it.

So the star needs to satisfy both conditions: apparent V mag ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and apparent V mag ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. That means they can observe stars with V <=17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <=16.

Wait, no, wait. Because the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17" can be observed by ESPRESSO. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a magnitude brighter than 17 would be less than 17. So the maximum magnitude observed by ESPRESSO is 17. So any star with V ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so V ≤16.

Wait, but wait, when they say "brighter than 17", that's for ESPRESSO. So if a star's V magnitude is 16, that's brighter than 17? Yes, because 16 is less than
