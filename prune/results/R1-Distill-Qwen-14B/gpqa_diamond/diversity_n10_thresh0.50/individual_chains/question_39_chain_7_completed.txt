Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it. Alright, the question is about finding the value of "a" in the wave function. The setup is that each particle is moving in a tube along the x-axis, and when we measure their positions, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm.

Wait, wait, I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it must be normalized. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but does that make sense? Because a wave function with an imaginary part isn't usual unless it's in a time-dependent form. But the problem states that each particle's wave function is in a part of space where it can exist, so maybe the imaginary part is part of the function. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the wave function is given as a complex function. But in that case, the normalization would involve integrating the modulus squared. Wait, but the problem says that when we measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside of that interval. Wait, no, the wave function is given as (a/√(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a function that's (a/√(1+x)) real part and -0.5 imaginary part. But that would imply that the wave function is complex everywhere, not just in a certain region. But the measurements only find them between 1 and 3, so maybe the wave function is non-zero only in that interval. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the real part is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, perhaps the entire function is only defined in that region, and zero outside. Or perhaps the wave function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and we're to find the normalization such that the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Wait, but the modulus squared of a complex function is (real part squared plus imaginary part squared), right? So let's compute |ψ(x)|^2. So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. So that would be (a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25.

But wait, when we integrate this from x=1 to x=3, it should equal 1. So the integral would be ∫[1 to 3] (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1.

Wait, but that would give me two separate integrals. Let's compute each part. The first integral is a² ∫[1 to 3] 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so evaluated from 1 to 3, that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first term becomes a² * ln(2). The second integral is ∫0.25 dx from 1 to3, which is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5. So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, but that would mean a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let's compute that. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is around 0.721. Then a would be the square root of that, so sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So that would correspond to option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Does that make sense as a normalized wave function? Because the modulus squared includes both terms. But is that the correct approach?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the wave function is only the real part, and the imaginary part is a typo or something. Because usually, wave functions are real for stationary states. Oh, right, the time-independent Schrödinger equation's solutions are often real, but sometimes you can have complex solutions, but that typically involves time dependence. But in this case, perhaps the imaginary part is a mistake, or perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the real part for normalization.

Wait, the problem says that the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm. If the wave function is complex, then the normalization is as I did before, but if they consider only the real part, then the integral would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but in this case, it's given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. That's a bit unusual. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the wave function is written as a complex function, but for normalization, I should take the modulus squared. So let me proceed with that approach.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1.

As I did earlier, |ψ(x)|² is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes ∫1^3 [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = a² * ln(2) + 0.5.

This must equal 1, so a squared times ln(2) is 0.5. So a squared is 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, option B.

But wait, another possibility. What if the wave function is actually ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) e^{-i something}, so the modulus is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is from the exponential. But in the question, the wave function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which would imply that the function is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts, not just a phase factor.

In that case, the approach I took earlier is correct, leading to a ≈0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So in the regions x <1 and x>3, ψ(x)=0. But the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which would be non-zero outside that region unless a is zero, which can't be the case because the wave function should be normalized.

Wait, so perhaps the wave function is only defined between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the given function is in that interval, and zero outside. So when I integrate, I should only integrate from 1 to 3.

But that doesn't change the previous calculation, because that's already what I did. So the a comes out to be approximately 0.85.

Another possibility: perhaps the wave function is purely real, and the imaginary part is a typo or perhaps the problem intended just the real part. If that were the case, then the wave function is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is zero. Then the modulus squared is just (a²)/(1+x), and the integral would be a² ln(2) =1, so a would be sqrt(1/ln(2)) ≈ sqrt(1.4427) ≈ 1.201, which isn't one of the options. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as a real function, and the -0.5i is a mistake or perhaps I misread. Let me check the problem statement again.

The question says: the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5 i. So it's definitely a complex function.

Hmm, but the presence of the imaginary part complicates things. Because when we compute the modulus squared, it's (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25, as I did earlier.

Wait, but the problem states that none of the particles were found outside x=1 and x=3, which suggests that the wave function is zero outside that interval. So our integral for normalization should only consider x from 1 to 3.

So our calculation should stand, leading to a≈0.85, which is option B. So I think the correct answer is B.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \(\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\), we use the normalization condition for wave functions, which states that the integral of the modulus squared of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Since the problem specifies that particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is non-zero only in this interval, and we integrate over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \).

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

1. The first integral is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. The second integral is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
