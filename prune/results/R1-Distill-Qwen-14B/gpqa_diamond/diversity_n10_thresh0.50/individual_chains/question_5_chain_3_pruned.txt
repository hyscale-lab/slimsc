Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see. The operator is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem states that these are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 when the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So wait, I think that means the operator we're considering is in the direction of n, which lies in the x-z plane. Oh right, any direction in the x-z plane can be represented by some angle theta from the z-axis, right? Like, in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle. 

So, the operator P along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. Wait, no, actually, for a vector operator, the operator in direction n is the dot product of the vector operator with the unit vector n. So, P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. 

But since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n can be written as (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), because in the x-z plane, the angle theta would be measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta), n_y=0. 

Therefore, the operator we're interested in is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |psi> = (ħ/2) |psi>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

But wait, let's write down what each component matrix is. 

P_x is ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]], so [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. 

P_y is ħ/2 times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so [[0, -iħ/2], [i ħ/2, 0]]. 

P_z is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], so [[ ħ/2, 0], [0, -ħ/2 ]]. 

So the operator P_n is n_x P_x + n
