Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental stateâ€”so that's the lowest energy state, right? And a photon is being absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The given data includes the masses of the atoms, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. Wait, the elements are X and Y, their masses are 20 amu and 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters, I think. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

So the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I believe is the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor is a bit different. Oh wait, maybe the question refers to the quantum mechanical model where both rotational and vibrational states are considered. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or maybe J=1? Hmm, wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational states start at J=0, but in the rigid rotor model, sometimes J=0 is the ground state. But in the non-rigid rotor, things might change a bit. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which
