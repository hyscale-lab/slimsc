Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. From spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same? Because if T changes, lambda_max changes. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. I'm not sure how radial velocity affects luminosity yet. But wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body radiation formula. So maybe the radial velocity is a red herring, or perhaps it's used for something else. Hmm.

The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So we need to compute L1 / L2.

I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is the radius, T the temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both are black bodies, their luminosities depend on R squared and T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So as I thought earlier, using Wien's law, T1 = T2 because lambda_max is same. So T1 = T2. So the temperatures are equal. So in that case, when we compute L1 / L2, since T cancels out, it's (R1²) / (R2²) times (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1 / R2)^
