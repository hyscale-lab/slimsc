Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I need to recall what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry refers to the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether Poincaré is a separate symmetry or just a combination. Oh right, Poincaré includes both translations (like shifting all events by the same amount in space and time) and Lorentz transformations.

Now, in the Standard Model, the SM includes both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. Since SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM, I think all operators in SMEFT should respect the symmetries that the SM respects. So Lorentz and Poincaré must be there.

Wait, but wait. Do all SMEFT operators have to respect both Lorentz and Poincaré? Or is one a subset of the other? Because Poincaré includes Lorentz, if an operator respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. So perhaps in the question, the options are considering whether each symmetry is individually required.

But the question is which must be respected by all operators. So both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries need to be respected. Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz indices, which suggests that Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. But what about Poincaré? I think that in general, the effective theory must respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes both Lorentz and Poincaré. So operators in SMEFT must be Poincaré invariant.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But when you write down the SMEFT Lagrangian, it's a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian, which includes the possibility of having
