Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right? But wait, which way is the relative motion here. Wait, relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then A is moving faster than B. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, from the perspective of the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c), the second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference in their velocities divided by (1 - (product of velocities over c²)).

So let's calculate that. u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 -
