Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the spectral line shifts are given for each star. Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method relies on the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's orbit. The shift is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity towards or away from us.

Wait, the formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (P/(2π))^(1/3), but I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, wait—maybe another approach. I think there's a relation involving the orbital period and the velocity shift. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like, their mass is much smaller than the star's, which is Sun-like. So M_p << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies. Let me see, K would be proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3). Because if I factor that formula, it becomes K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)). Wait, because M_star is the same for both stars, right? Both stars have the same mass as the Sun. So M_p is the same for both planets? Wait, no, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, but not exactly the same. Hmm. Wait, no—Planet #1 and Planet #2 have similar masses to Neptune. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2. Because they
