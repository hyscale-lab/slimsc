Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what each reaction step does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. When it reacts with KOH, especially under heating, I think it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3, heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to the formation of an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr and form an alkene between carbons 1 and 3. Wait, but the positions matter. So when two vicinal bromides (like 1 and 3 being adjacent in the adamantane structure) eliminate, they form a double bond.

Wait, actually, the structure of adamantane is such that the positions 1 and 3 are across from each other in the diamondoid structure, but wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: Adamantane has a structure where each bridge has four carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent bridgeheads? Or maybe not. Wait, maybe 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when dehydrohalogenation occurs, the two Brs would leave, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. So product 1 is adamantene? Because it's missing two Hs, leading to a double bond. So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, no, because the formula would lose two HBr molecules. So, the initial structure is C10H16Br2, and after elimination, it would
