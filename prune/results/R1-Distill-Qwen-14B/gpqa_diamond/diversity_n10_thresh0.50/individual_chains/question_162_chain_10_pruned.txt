Okay, so I've got this question about a pseudosphere and calculating its area using a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of hyperbolic surface, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The metric provided is ds² equals 32 divided by (4 minus x² minus y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions because it's dx and dy. But pseudospheres are two-dimensional surfaces, right? Or maybe not, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry, and it's a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given probably represents this geometry. But how do I find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?

Wait, what's the formula for the area of a pseudosphere? I remember that for a regular sphere, the surface area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Oh right, the pseudosphere has infinite area because it's a surface of infinite extent. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the metric here might represent a finite region. Wait, no, the metric is given for some coordinate system, perhaps.

Wait, the metric here is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let's call that denominator 4 - (x² + y²
