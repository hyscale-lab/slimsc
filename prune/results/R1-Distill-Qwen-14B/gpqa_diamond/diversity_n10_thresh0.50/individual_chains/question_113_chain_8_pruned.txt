Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the given data. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, there are other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak which could be a carbonyl group (C=O). But 1650 is a bit lower. I'm trying to recall: maybe a conjugated carbonyl? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with some substitution. Another thought: maybe the 1650 is from an amide or another type of carbonyl, but the presence of a broad peak around 3000 might suggest something else.

Then, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, right? So the molecule probably has a double bond. That makes me think maybe it's an ester, a ketone, or something with an aromatic ring, but wait, no, aromatic rings have protons in a different region. Oh wait, vinyl protons are typically in the range of around 4.5-7 ppm, but that's not
