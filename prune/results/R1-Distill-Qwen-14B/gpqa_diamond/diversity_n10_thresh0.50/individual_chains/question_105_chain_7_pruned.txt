Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of the area, I think. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. When the star rotates, these spots come into view and then go away, causing the star's brightness to vary over time. The question is, how does the brightness variation from the spots compare to the variation caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star?

Wait, no, actually, the problem is reversed. The scenario with the spots produces a certain brightness variation, and we're supposed to find the radius of a planet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. But the star isn't covered by spots in the hypothetical; the problem states that if the star wasn't spotty, what exoplanet radius would give the same signal. Hmm, maybe I got that right.

So the key is to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and compare it to the change caused by a planet transit.

First, I think I should calculate the change in brightness due to the spots. Then, find the planet's radius that would cause the same change.

Let me break it down.

The star has a radius R* = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, so the filling factor is 0.2. But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. Since the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere would be 2πR². So one hemisphere is 2πR², and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the surface area in the hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). The hemisphere area is 2πR², so the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so a hemisphere is 2π steradians. Wait, no, in terms of area, it's 2πR².

So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area of the spots is 0.4πR².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The star's total flux is proportional to the area times the temperature^4. So the star's total flux without spots is F_total = σTeff^4 * 4πR² (since the entire surface is emitting). Wait, but the star's surface emits from all areas, so the total flux is F_total = σ*Teff^4 * 4πR².

When the spots are present, the flux is the sum of the normal areas and the spots. So the flux becomes F_total = σ*Teff^4*(4πR² - area of
