Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method looks at the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits, and we can detect that shift in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with similar mass to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the setup is that the stars are identical in mass, and their planets are similar in mass, but the RV shifts are different.

The shift for planet #1 is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV method gives us the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) * ... ) ) Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) )

But since the masses of the planets are much smaller than the stars, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So this simplifies things. Also, since the stars have the same mass and the planets' masses are similar (Neptune-like), their M_p terms are roughly the same.

So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )? Wait, I think it's better to write the formula as:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )
