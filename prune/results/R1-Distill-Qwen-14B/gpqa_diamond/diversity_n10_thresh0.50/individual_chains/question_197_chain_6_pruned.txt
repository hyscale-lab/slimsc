Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. They've given me the IR and NMR data for Compound X. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of an ester, especially in the presence of a base. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are usually used in the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe in the cleavage of certain protecting groups. Or wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be involved in the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond, like in the case of the Clemmensen reduction? No, Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg), right? Oh wait, another thought: the combination of red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's used to convert a nitrile to an amine? No, I think for that, you'd use something like H2S and then maybe a work-up. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Let me look back at the data given. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500, which suggests O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol
