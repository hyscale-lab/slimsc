Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |psi><psi|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so their density matrices are convex combinations of projectors.

Wait, this rho looks like it's a combination of |0><0| and |1><1|. Both are projectors, and they're being added with equal coefficients (each has 1/2). So rho is an equal mixture of the states |0> and |1>. So it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Because for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix of a pure state |psi> is |psi><psi|, which corresponds to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. For a mixed state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r and the identity matrix. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me write that down. The density matrix can be expressed as:

rho = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2

Where r_x, r_y, r_z are the components of the Bloch vector r.

Since the state is a mixed state, the Bloch vector's length should be less than or equal to 1. For a completely mixed state, which is (I/2), the Bloch vector should be zero because r is (0,0,0). Because that would make rho = I/2.

Looking back at the given rho: (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute what that is in terms of the Pauli matrices. Let's see, |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with [1,0], |1><1| is [0,1]. Adding them gives [[1
