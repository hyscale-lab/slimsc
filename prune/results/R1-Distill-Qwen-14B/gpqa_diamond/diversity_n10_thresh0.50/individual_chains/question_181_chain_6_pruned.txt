Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun and how it would change if a certain reaction branch in the core suddenly stopped. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me recall what I know about the Sun's energy production. The Sun's core is mainly doing hydrogen fusion, right? The proton-proton chain, or the pp chain, is the main process. I think the pp chain has a few branches. Oh wait, pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch probably produces different things. Oh right, the pp-III branch is a minor part, I believe, involving boron. Let me think. In the pp-III branch, two protons add to a boron-11 ion, which then fuses with another proton to become carbon-12, and then that goes on to produce helium. Or wait, maybe it's a different pathway. Either way, the key here is that the pp-III branch is stopped.

The question is about the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the production of neutrinos in these energy ranges would change if the pp-III branch ceases. 

I remember that most of the solar neutrinos are from the dominant pp-I process, but there are other sources like the CNO cycle. Wait, but the question says all other reactions remain as they were, so the CNO cycle isn't affected. So the change is only in the pp-III branch. 

Neutrinos are produced in different processes. The main ones are the electron neutrinos from beta decays in the pp chain and the CNO cycle. Let me think about the energies involved. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos from the reaction where beryllium-7 captures a proton to become carbon-8, which then emits a neutrino and turns into two alpha particles. The neutrinos from pp-I are typically in a certain energy range. Similarly, the pp-III branch would produce neutrinos as part of its process.

Wait, but I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are actually the high-energy ones. Because in the pp-III process, the production involves higher masses, perhaps leading to higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe it's the other
