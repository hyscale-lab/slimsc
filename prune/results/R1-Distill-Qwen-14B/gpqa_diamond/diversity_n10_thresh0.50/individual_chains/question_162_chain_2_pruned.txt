Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric because it has dx² and dy² terms. So maybe it's describing a 2-dimensional spacetime, but since we're talking about area, perhaps it's a spatial metric embedded in some way.

Wait, I remember that the area of a surface in a metric can be found using the area element. The area element in 2D is usually sqrt(g_x g_y) dx dy, right? But wait, no, the metric is in terms of ds², so more accurately, the area element in 2D would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric here is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the (dx²) and (dy²) coefficients.

Looking at the metric, the coefficients for dx² and dy² are the same, so it's (32)/(4 - x² - y²) for each. So the determinant of the metric tensor g would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, because for a 2x2 diagonal matrix, the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements. So g = diag(a, a), so det g = a², where a is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element dA would be
