      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.\n\nThe problem states that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors with complex numbers, right? Oh, wait, maybe the components are real here. So the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that.\n\nCalculating the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, that's 6, which is more than 1. So maybe the state isn't normalized. That's a problem. Oh wait, perhaps the state is given as a vector, but perhaps it's already normalized? Or perhaps the components are probabilities or something else. Hmm, maybe I should proceed and see if that matters later.\n\nThe operators for P and Q are given as square matrices. Operator P's matrix is:\n\nFirst row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nSecond row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nThird row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nAnd operator Q's matrix is diagonal: first row 1, 0, 0; second row 0,0,0; third row 0,0,-1.\n\nThe question is about measuring P first and then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So if we measure P first and get a certain value, the state will collapse into the corresponding eigenstate. Then, measuring Q on this new state would give another probability.\n\nBut wait, I think the process is: first measure P, then measure Q on the resulting state.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.\n2. Determine which eigenstate corresponds to the eigenvalue 0.\n3. Calculate the probability that the initial state collapses into that eigenstate when measuring P.\n4. Then, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Q.\n5. Since Q is diagonal, its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n6. The eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue -1 is simply the third basis vector, since Q is diagonal. So if the state after measuring P is the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, then we need to find the probability that this state, when measured with Q, gives -1.\n\nWait, but Q is diagonal, so its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. So the eigenvalue -1 corresponds to the state |3> (assuming basis vectors are |1>, |2>, |3>).\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nFirst, find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix for P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet's set up the matrix:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/sqrt(2)      0         |\n| 1/sqrt(2)  -\u03bb        1/sqrt(2) |\n| 0        1/sqrt(2)   -\u03bb        |\n\nCalculating the determinant:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ] = 0\n\nWait, maybe expanding along the first row.\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 * something.\n\nSo det = (-\u03bb) [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-\u03bb)/sqrt(2) ] + 0.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)/2.\n\nSecond term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-\u03bb/sqrt(2)) ) = - [ (-\u03bb) / 2 ] = \u03bb/2.\n\nSo adding all terms: (-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 ) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) =0 \u2192 \u03bb=0 or \u03bb\u00b2=1 \u2192 \u03bb=\u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo when we measure P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.\n\nWe are interested in the case where P is measured to be 0. So we need the eigenvector(s) corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for P when \u03bb=0.\n\nWe set up (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0\n\nRow 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nRow 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 = 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 same as row 1.\n\nSo from row 1, v2=0.\n\nFrom row 2, v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, v3]^T = [a, 0, -a]^T, where a is a scalar.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are of the form a*(1, 0, -1)^T. So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2))*(1,0,-1)^T, because the norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 =2 \u2192 1/sqrt(2) is the normalization factor.\n\nWait, but wait: let's calculate the normalization. The vector (1,0,-1) has length sqrt(1 + 0 +1) = sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo the eigenstate for P=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, the initial state is given as the vector [-1, 2, 1]^T. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, but in this case, the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Hmm, but when computing probabilities, perhaps we can proceed by considering it as a state vector and compute the projections accordingly.\n\nSo the initial state is |\u03c8> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nWe need to compute the amplitude of |\u03c8> in the eigenstate of P=0, which is |e> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe probability is |<e|\u03c8>|^2.\n\nCompute the inner product <e|\u03c8>:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 \u2192 [ (-1) + (-1) ] / sqrt(2) \u2192 (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nWait, wait, let me compute it again.\n\n<e|\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) \u2192 (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThe magnitude squared is ( -sqrt(2) )^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but the norm of |\u03c8> is sqrt(6), and the norm of |e> is 1.\n\nWait, but the inner product is <e|\u03c8> = [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) ) + 0*2 + ( (-1/sqrt(2))*1 ) ] \u2192 (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) \u2192 (-2)/sqrt(2) \u2192 which is -sqrt(2).\n\nSo the square is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.\n\nBut wait, the state |e> is normalized, but |\u03c8> is not. So the probability is |<e|\u03c8>|^2 / (||\u03c8||^2) ?\n\nWait, no. Because in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized. If |\u03c8> is not normalized, then the probabilities are computed by normalizing it. So the actual state would be |\u03c8> / ||\u03c8||.\n\nSo ||\u03c8||^2 is 6, so the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo the amplitude is <e| (\u03c8 / sqrt(6) )> \u2192 (1/sqrt(6)) * <e|\u03c8> \u2192 (1/sqrt(6)) * (-sqrt(2)) ) \u2192 -sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is |amplitude|^2 \u2192 (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me re-calculate.\n\nCompute <e|\u03c8> where |e> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) and |\u03c8> is [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).\n\nThen, since the state |\u03c8> is not normalized, its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |\u03c8> / sqrt(6).\n\nSo the amplitude is <e| (|\u03c8> / sqrt(6)) ) = (-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6) = (-sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)) = -sqrt(2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).\n\nThe probability is ( -1/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |e> (the eigenstate of P=0), which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, we measure Q. The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors |1> = (1,0,0), |2>=(0,1,0), |3>=(0,0,1).\n\nThe state after measuring P is |e> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nWe need to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1, which corresponds to the eigenstate |3> = (0,0,1).\n\nThe amplitude is the inner product <3|e> \u2192 (0,0,1) \u00b7 (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) \u2192 -1/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is |amplitude|^2 \u2192 (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the combined probability of first measuring P=0 (with probability 1/3) and then measuring Q=-1 (with probability 1/2) is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait. No, because after measuring P=0, the state is |e>, and the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the inner product squared between |e> and |3>.\n\nSo the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option D is 1/6. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial state isn't normalized, but when calculating probabilities, you have to normalize the state first.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized because the probabilities must sum to 1. So in the given state [-1, 2, 1]^T, the norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nSo when calculating the inner product with |e>, it's (1/sqrt(6)) times the inner product with the unnormalized state.\n\nEarlier calculation: <e|\u03c8> = (-sqrt(2)).\n\nSo <e| (\u03c8 / sqrt(6)) ) = (-sqrt(2)) / sqrt(6) \u2192 which simplifies to -1/sqrt(3).\n\nSo the probability for P=0 is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.\n\nThen, when measuring Q, the state is |e> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe probability to get Q=-1 is the square of the component in |3>, which is (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nSo the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D) 1/6.\n\n\nThe problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector given as \\( |\\psi\\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \\), and two observables \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to calculate the probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) followed by \\( Q = -1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the initial state\nThe norm of the initial state is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( P \\)\nThe operator \\( P \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for the eigenvalues of \\( P \\), the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\) yields eigenvalues \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized. Let's calculate the magnitude squared. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the squares are 1, 4, 1. Adding them gives 6. Oh, so it's not normalized. Hmm. Maybe I need to normalize it first. The normalized state would be the original vector divided by sqrt(6). So each component would be (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).\n\nNext, there are two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as matrices. For P, the matrix is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). For Q, the matrix is diagonal: (1, 0, -1) on the diagonal, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nThe question is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, no. Wait, the measurements are done in order: someone measures Q just after P. Wait, no: the question says \"if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P.\" So the order is P first, then Q. So we need to find the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements affects the probabilities because the first measurement affects the state. So when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when you measure Q, it's on this new state.\n\nBut wait, maybe the question is about the joint probability of first getting P=0 and then Q=-1. Or perhaps it's the probability that when you measure P, you get 0, and then when you measure Q, you get -1. But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So perhaps it's the product of probabilities, but I'm not sure if that's the case because the measurements are sequential and the second depends on the first.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the probability of getting P=0, and then, in the same state (but wait, no, because after the first measurement, the state collapses), so the second measurement is on the new state. So I need to compute the probability of P=0 in the initial state, then, given that, compute the probability of Q=-1 in that new state. Then multiply them together.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about measuring P and Q simultaneously, but the wording says \"just after the measurement of P,\" which suggests that the measurements are sequential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the probability that the first measurement of P gives 0 and the subsequent measurement of Q gives -1. So that would require finding the probability of P=0, then the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0, and multiply them.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P and Q are compatible observables, but perhaps they don't share a common eigenbasis, so their measurements are not independent.\n\nWait, but perhaps the process is: measure P first. The state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, measure Q on that eigenstate, and find the probability of getting -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: the system's initial state is given, then we measure P, get 0, which gives a certain state, then measure Q on that state and get -1. The overall probability is the product of the probabilities.\n\nBut let me think about the operators.\n\nLet me first look at operator P. The matrix is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]\n\nHmm. Let me write it out:\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, but what are the eigenvalues of P? Let's compute them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see that the matrix is symmetric, so it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. So that's good.\n\nLet me try to find the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nSo the matrix (P - \u03bb I) is:\n\nRow 1: [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ] \n\nWait, perhaps expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant would be:\n\n-\u03bb * det [ [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ] ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * det [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ], [0, -\u03bb ] ]\n+ 0 * something.\n\nWait, that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if there's a symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the eigenvalues, maybe 1 and -1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe 0 is an eigenvalue. Let me check if P has 0 as an eigenvalue.\n\nIf I set \u03bb=0, then the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWait, but the trace is 0, so sum of eigenvalues is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix can be written as P = (1/\u221a2) times another matrix, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for eigenvectors.\n\nLet me consider a possible eigenvector. Let's say v = [a, b, c]^T.\n\nThen, P v = \u03bb v.\n\nSo:\n\nEquation 1: (0)a + (1/\u221a2) b + 0 c = \u03bb a \u2192 (1/\u221a2) b = \u03bb a \u2192 equation (1): b = \u03bb a sqrt(2).\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) a + 0 b + (1/\u221a2) c = \u03bb b \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(a + c) = \u03bb b \u2192 equation (2): a + c = \u03bb b sqrt(2).\n\nEquation 3: 0 a + (1/\u221a2) b + 0 c = \u03bb c \u2192 (1/\u221a2) b = \u03bb c \u2192 equation (3): b = \u03bb c sqrt(2).\n\nNow, from equations 1 and 3: equation 1: b = \u03bb a sqrt(2), equation 3: b = \u03bb c sqrt(2).\n\nSo, \u03bb a sqrt(2) = \u03bb c sqrt(2) \u2192 \u03bb cancels (assuming \u03bb \u2260 0), so a = c.\n\nIf a = c, then equation 2: a + c = 2a = \u03bb b sqrt(2). But from equation 1, b = \u03bb a sqrt(2). So substituting into equation 2:\n\n2a = \u03bb ( \u03bb a sqrt(2) ) * sqrt(2) \u2192 2a = \u03bb^2 a (2) \u2192 2a = 2 \u03bb^2 a.\n\nAssuming a \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by a: 2 = 2 \u03bb^2 \u2192 \u03bb^2 = 1 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought \u03bb might be 0. Hmm.\n\nSo possible eigenvalues are \u03bb = 1 and \u03bb = -1. What about \u03bb=0?\n\nIf \u03bb=0, then equation 1: b=0, equation 3: b=0. So a and c can be anything as long as a=c. Let's see equation 2: a + c = 0 \u2192 a + a = 0 \u2192 2a=0 \u2192 a=0 \u2192 c=0. So the only solution is the zero vector, which can't be an eigenvector. So \u03bb=0 is not an eigenvalue.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 1 and -1. So the possible outcomes of measuring P are 1 and -1. But the problem is asking for the probability of getting P=0. Wait, that's a problem because 0 isn't an eigenvalue of P. So the probability of measuring P=0 must be zero. Then, the overall probability would be zero. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the eigenvalues. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when I set up the equations, I assumed that \u03bb \u2260 0. But perhaps \u03bb=0 is possible, but when I checked earlier, the only solution was the zero vector, which isn't valid, so \u03bb=0 is not an eigenvalue. So the possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.\" If P can't have 0 as a possible outcome, then the probability is zero. But the options don't have zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the eigenvalue calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. So if the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but perhaps there are three eigenvalues. Wait, no, the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if there are three eigenvalues, perhaps one is 0, and the others are 1 and -1. But earlier, I thought \u03bb=0 wasn't an eigenvalue. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalue calculation. Let me try again.\n\nWait, maybe the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. Let me check by plugging \u03bb=0 into the determinant.\n\nThe determinant when \u03bb=0 is:\n\ndet(P - 0 I) = determinant of P.\n\nWait, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute its determinant.\n\nP is:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nThe determinant can be calculated as:\n\n0*(0*0 - (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2)) ) - (1/\u221a2)*( (1/\u221a2)*0 - (1/\u221a2)*0 ) + 0*(something) \n\nWait, expanding along the first row:\n\n= 0 * minor - (1/\u221a2) * minor + 0 * minor.\n\nSo the first term is 0. The second term is -(1/\u221a2) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWait, no, the minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0]\n\nWait no, wait, when you remove column 2, the first row is [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], and the second row would be [0, 0]?\n\nWait, the original P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nWhen we remove the first row and the second column, the minor matrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0]\n\nWait, no, the minor for element (1,2) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix formed by the rows excluding row 1 and columns excluding column 2. So the minor matrix is:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, the minor for (1,2) is the determinant of:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nSo the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, 0]\n\nThe determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)(0) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= 0.\n\nSo the determinant of P is 0*(something) - (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(something) = 0.\n\nSo the determinant is zero, which means 0 is an eigenvalue. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried \u03bb=0, the only solution was the zero vector. Hmm, but if the determinant is zero, then there's a non-trivial solution. So perhaps I made a mistake in solving the equations for \u03bb=0.\n\nLet me try again. For \u03bb=0, the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: (1/\u221a2) b = 0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2)(a + c) = 0 \u2192 a + c = 0.\n\nEquation 3: (1/\u221a2) b = 0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nSo from equation 1 and 3, b=0. Then from equation 2, a + c = 0 \u2192 c = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 would be of the form (a, 0, -a)^T, where a is any scalar.\n\nSo for example, a=1 gives (1, 0, -1)^T. Let me check if this is an eigenvector.\n\nMultiplying P by (1, 0, -1)^T:\n\nP * [1; 0; -1] = \n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2)(1 -1) )= 0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSo the result is [0; 0; 0], which is 0 times the vector. So yes, (1, 0, -1)^T is an eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried solving for \u03bb=0, I thought the only solution was a=c=0, but that's not the case. So I must have made a mistake in the setup earlier. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes of measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the initial state is the vector (-1, 2, 1), which I should normalize.\n\nWait, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is 1/sqrt(6) * (-1, 2, 1).\n\nNow, to find the probability of measuring P=0, I need to find the projection of the initial state onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nThe eigenvector for \u03bb=0 is (1, 0, -1)^T, up to a scalar multiple. Let me take it as v0 = (1, 0, -1)^T. But I can also write it as any scalar multiple, so perhaps v0 = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2), since the norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2).\n\nWait, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).\n\nSo the inner product between the initial state and v0 is:\n\n( (-1)/sqrt(6) ) * (1)/sqrt(2) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * (0) + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\n= [ (-1)(1) + 0 + (1)(-1) ) ] / ( sqrt(6) * sqrt(2) )\n\n= [ (-1 -1) ] / (sqrt(12)) )\n\n= (-2) / (2 * sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nThen, after measuring P=0, the system collapses into the eigenvector v0, which is (1, 0, -1)^T / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to measure Q. The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.\n\nThe eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. Because Q is diagonal, each basis vector is an eigenvector. So for eigenvalue 1: e1 = (1, 0, 0)^T. For 0: e2 = (0,1,0)^T. For -1: e3 = (0,0,1)^T.\n\nNow, the state after measuring P=0 is v0 = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nWe need to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1, which corresponds to the eigenvector e3 = (0,0,1)^T.\n\nThe inner product between v0 and e3 is (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + (0) * 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = (-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThe probability is the absolute value squared: (1/2).\n\nSo the probability of measuring Q=-1 after measuring P=0 is 1/2.\n\nSo the total probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 1/6. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) and \\( Q = -1 \\) in sequence for a quantum system. The state of the system is given as \\( \\psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \\), which is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as \\( \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6} \\), so the normalized state is:\n\n\\[\n\\psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( P \\)\nThe operator \\( P \\) is represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are determined to be \\( 0, 1, -1 \\). The eigenvector corresponding to \\( P = 0 \\) is \\( v_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \\).\n\n### Step 2: Probability of \\( P = 0 \\)\nThe probability of measuring \\( P = 0 \\) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \\( \\psi \\) onto \\( v_0 \\). The inner product is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\cdot [(-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1)] = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the absolute value squared:\n\n\\[\nP(P=0) = \\left| \\langle v_0 | \\psi \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: State after \\( P = 0 \\)\nIf \\( P = 0 \\) is measured, the system collapses into the eigenstate \\( v_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \\).\n\n### Step 4: Probability of \\( Q = -1 \\)\nThe operator \\( Q \\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \\( 1, 0, -1 \\), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector corresponding to \\( Q = -1 \\) is \\( e_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T \\).
