      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal too. So, it's like a cube that's been compressed or expanded along the diagonals, maybe? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact structure, but I think the key here is the interplanar distance for a specific plane, which is (111) in this case.\n\nThe problem gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the edges, right? So that's 'a' in the unit cell. But wait, no, wait\u2014no, the interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell, which for a rhombohedral system is the same along all axes since it's a cubic system but with angles not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral isn't cubic. Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal, and all angles are the same but not 90 degrees. So, it's a special case, like a cube but with skewed angles.\n\nSo, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, with a = b = c, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30 degrees. Oh, wait, no\u2014wait, the question says \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30 degrees. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles can be either all acute or all obtuse, but I think they are all equal. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula derived from the Miller indices. I remember the general formula for d is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hkl)(cos \u03b1 + cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3) / a^2 ) )\n\nWait, no, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the more general formula. Oh wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = (1/\u221a( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2(hk cos \u03b3) - 2(hl cos \u03b2) - 2(kl cos \u03b1) )) ) \u00d7 (a / sqrt(1 + 2cos \u03b1 + 2cos \u03b2 + 2cos \u03b3 + cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + cos\u00b2 \u03b2 + cos\u00b2 \u03b3 )) )\n\nWait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I think for a general crystal system, the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk (cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3 - cos \u03b1)) ) )\n\nWait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think again. The general formula for the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - 2(hk cos \u03b3_hk) - 2(hl cos \u03b3_hl) - 2(kl cos \u03b3_kl) ) ) \u00d7 (a / ... something?)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall the formula from the Bragg's Law context. Oh right, the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - (h k + h l + k l) * (cos \u03b8) )\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Alternatively, I think the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because for a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cosines would be zero, and the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2), which is correct. So yes, this must be the right formula.\n\nWait, but in a general system, the formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) ) ) \u00d7 (1/ (a))?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting it the other way around. Wait, no, the correct formula is:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWait, but wait a second. No, because for a cubic system with \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=90 degrees, the cosines are zero, so d = a / sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2), which is correct. So that must be the formula.\n\nWait, but wait, the denominator would be h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo in this problem, the Miller indices are (1,1,1). The angles are all 30 degrees, so \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, and a=10 Angstroms.\n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) + 2(1\u00d71 cos 30 + 1\u00d71 cos 30 + 1\u00d71 cos 30) )\n\nLet me compute the denominator step by step.\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 = 1 +1 +1 =3.\n\nThe next term is 2( hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3 ). Since all angles are 30\u00b0, and h=k=l=1.\n\nSo, hk=1\u00d71=1. Similarly for the others.\n\nSo the sum inside the 2(...) is:\n\ncos 30 + cos30 + cos30 = 3 * cos 30.\n\nSo the entire second term is 2 * 3 * cos30 = 6 * (\u221a3/2) )= 3\u221a3.\n\nSo denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 3\u221a3 )\n\nWait, wait, let me recheck. The denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(cos30 + cos30 + cos30 )) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 2 is multiplied by the sum of the three terms, each of which is cos \u03b1, cos \u03b2, cos \u03b3, each multiplied by hk, hl, kl.\n\nWait, in this case, hk=1, so each term is cos30. So sum is 3 * cos30.\n\nSo the entire second part is 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 cos30.\n\nSo the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )\n\nWait, but wait, the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2( hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3 ) )\n\nWhich is the same as sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos30) )\n\nBecause hk, hl, kl are each 1*1=1, and cos terms are each 30.\n\nSo 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 cos30.\n\nSo denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )\n\nCompute cos30: \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nSo 6 * 0.8660 \u2248 5.196.\n\nSo 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196). Let's compute that.\n\nI know that 2.85^2 = 8.1225, 2.86^2=8.1796, 2.87^2=8.2369. So 8.196 is between 2.86 and 2.87. Let's compute 2.86^2 = (2.86)^2 = 8.1796. 8.196-8.1796=0.0164.\n\nSo, 0.0164/(2*2.86) )= 0.0164/(5.72) \u2248 0.00287. So approximate sqrt(8.196) \u2248 2.86 + 0.00287 \u2248 2.86287.\n\nSo denominator is approx 2.86287.\n\nSo d = 10 / 2.86287 \u2248 3.493 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, wait, I'm confused. Wait, a=10 Angstroms. So d = 10 / 2.86287 \u2248 3.493. But the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. Maybe the denominator is the reciprocal or something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( ... ), and I miscalculated the denominator.\n\nWait, let me recheck the formula. The formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWait, in this case, a=10, and the denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )= sqrt(3 + 6*(\u221a3/2) ) = sqrt(3 + 3\u221a3 )\n\nWait, 3\u221a3 is approximately 5.196, so 3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.8628.\n\nSo d=10 / 2.8628 \u22483.493 Angstroms. But the options are all around 9-10 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the denominator is sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - (hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) ) ?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense for a cubic system. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the reciprocal of the formula. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused the formula. Let me look up the correct formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system.\n\nWait, I can't look it up, but I recall that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWait, that's what I thought earlier, but when I computed, it gave a small d, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( ... ), but perhaps the a here is different.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. But in a rhombohedral system, a is the edge length. So if a=10 Angstroms, then the calculation should be as I did.\n\nWait, but the options are around 9 Angstroms, which is close to a=10. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator.\n\nWait, let's recompute the denominator:\n\nDenominator: sqrt(3 + 6 cos30 )\n\nWait, 6 cos30 is 6*(\u221a3/2) = 3\u221a3 \u22485.196.\n\nSo 3 +5.196=8.196.\n\nsqrt(8.196)= approx 2.8628.\n\nSo d=10 / 2.8628 \u22483.493.\n\nHmm, but the options are all around 9 Angstroms. So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. I think I might have confused the formula. Another possibility is that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos \u03b8) )\n\nWait, where \u03b8 is the angle between the edges. In a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so \u03b8=30 degrees.\n\nWait, let me try this formula:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos \u03b8 )\n\nSo for (111), h=k=l=1.\n\nSo numerator is 1+1+1=3.\n\nThe second term is (1+1+1) * cos30 =3 * (\u221a3/2)\u22482.598.\n\nSo denominator inside sqrt is 3 -2.598=0.402.\n\nsqrt(0.402) \u22480.634.\n\nSo d=10 / 0.634\u224815.76 Angstroms. That's not matching either. So I'm definitely getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWait, which is what I did before. So perhaps I'm correct but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the interatomic distance being 10 Angstroms, but perhaps a is something else.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = 1 / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) ) ) \u00d7 a\n\nBut that's what I did. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, 3 + 6*(\u221a3/2) =3 +3\u221a3. 3\u221a3\u22485.196. So 3+5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.8628.\n\nSo 10 /2.8628 \u22483.493 Angstroms. But the options are much higher. So perhaps the formula is the reciprocal?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a = d * sqrt(...). So d= a / sqrt(...). So the calculation is correct. But the options don't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the Miller indices. Wait, the question is about the (111) plane. So h=k=l=1.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the formula from another source. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure factor, but no, that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which can be thought of as a cube deformed by shear along one axis. The interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral systems can sometimes be simplified when all the angles are the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for a rhombohedral system is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle between the edges.\n\nIn this case, \u03b8=30\u00b0, so cos \u03b8=\u221a3/2 \u22480.866.\n\nSo for (111):\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 =3.\n\nhk +hl +kl =3.\n\nSo 2(hk+hl+kl) cos \u03b8 = 2*3*(\u221a3/2)=3\u221a3\u22485.196.\n\nSo denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.8628.\n\nSo d=10/2.8628\u22483.493 Angstroms.\n\nWait, but the options are in the 9-10 range. That's way off. Hmm. So I must have a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not 'a' but the nearest neighbor distance. Wait, no, the interatomic distance in a crystal is usually the edge length 'a' of the unit cell. So a=10 Angstroms.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, that can't be, because for cubic, the formula gives d= a/sqrt(3) \u22485.7735 for (111). So for a=10, d=5.7735. But the options don't have that either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think about the volume of the unit cell. In a rhombohedral system, the volume is a\u00b3 * sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 \u03b1 - cos\u00b2 \u03b2 - cos\u00b2 \u03b3 + 2 cos \u03b1 cos \u03b2 cos \u03b3 ), but that might not help here.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is different. Another formula I recall is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) + 2 (hk cos \u03b3 + hl cos \u03b1 + kl cos \u03b2) )\n\nWait, but in this case, all angles are 30\u00b0, so it's the same as before. So denominator is same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as using the Bravais lattice vectors. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector.\n\nWait, the reciprocal lattice vector components for a rhombohedral system are given by:\n\nl_h = (1/a) (h + k cos \u03b3 + l cos \u03b2 )\n\nSimilarly for l_k and l_l. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nSo let me recompute:\n\nh=k=l=1, \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0, a=10.\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n3 + 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 ) \n\n=3 + 2*(3*(\u221a3/2)) \n\n=3 + 2*( (3\u221a3)/2 )\n\n=3 + 3\u221a3 \n\nWhich is 3 +5.196=8.196.\n\nsqrt(8.196)=2.8628.\n\nSo d=10 /2.8628\u22483.493 Angstroms.\n\nBut the options are all around 9-10. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me recalculate with 60.\n\ncos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator: 3 + 2*(3 *0.5 )=3 + 3=6.\n\nsqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10/2.449\u22484.082 Angstroms. Still not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is reciprocal. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = 1 / ( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) ) * a\n\nNo, that would make the denominator in the wrong units.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the formula from a different perspective. Let's think about the reciprocal lattice.\n\nWait, the reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system are given by:\n\nb1 = (1/a)(1, 1, 1)\n\nBut no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor.\n\nWait, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:\n\n[ 1        cos \u03b3      cos \u03b3      ]\n\n[ cos \u03b3    1        cos \u03b3      ]\n\n[ cos \u03b3    cos \u03b3    1          ]\n\nWait, but since all angles are 30\u00b0, the metric tensor is:\n\n[1   cos30   cos30 ]\n\n[cos30 1   cos30 ]\n\n[cos30 cos30 1 ]\n\nThe reciprocal metric tensor (for the reciprocal lattice) is the inverse of this matrix. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:\n\nd = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nBut that would be for a specific case. Hmm, but for a=10 Angstroms and angles 30\u00b0, perhaps I'm missing a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the volume of the unit cell. The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b8 + 2 cos^3 \u03b8 )\n\nWait, but that's for the volume. Not sure if that helps here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think: perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - (hk (cos \u03b1 + cos \u03b2 + cos \u03b3) ) )\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle between the edges.\n\nIn our case, \u03b8=30\u00b0, a=10, h=k=l=1.\n\nSo denominator: 3 + 2*(3)*cos30 =3 +6*(\u221a3/2)=3+3\u221a3\u22483+5.196=8.196.\n\nSo sqrt(8.196)=2.8628.\n\nd=10/2.8628\u22483.493 Angstroms.\n\nBut the options are all around 9-10, which is much larger. So I'm getting a value that's way off. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be using the reciprocal of the denominator. Let me try 10 * sqrt(8.196) \u224810 *2.8628\u224828.628. That's way too big.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Maybe the formula is:\n\nd = a / (sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) ) ) \n\nBut that's only for a cubic system with angles 90\u00b0, which would give d=10/sqrt(3)=5.7735. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The calculation I get doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I should reevaluate my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me think again. Another formula I found online (from what I remember) is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nBut wait, for a cubic system, cos \u03b8=0, so d = a/sqrt(3), which is correct.\n\nWait, let me try this formula with \u03b8=30\u00b0, h=k=l=1.\n\nSo denominator: 3 -2*(3)*cos30 =3 -6*(\u221a3/2)=3 -3\u221a3\u22483-5.196= -2.196.\n\nWait, that's negative, which can't be. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWhich gives a positive denominator.\n\nBut in that case, for our problem, I get d\u22483.493, which isn't in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.\n\nWait, let me compute 3 +6*(\u221a3/2) =3 +3\u221a3. 3\u221a3 is about 5.196, so 3+5.196=8.196.\n\nsqrt(8.196)=approx 2.8628.\n\n10/2.8628\u22483.493 Angstroms.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the question expects a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance given is not 'a' but the distance between atoms along the diagonal, but that complicates things.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )) \u00d7 (some factor due to angles).\n\nBut without knowing the exact formula, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the structure factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) \u00d7 ... but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. The interplanar distance is the magnitude of the vector perpendicular to the plane (hkl).\n\nWait, the normal vector to the (hkl) plane in terms of the lattice vectors is (h a1 +k a2 + l a3). The magnitude is sqrt( h\u00b2 a1\u00b2 +k\u00b2 a2\u00b2 + l\u00b2 a3\u00b2 + 2hk a1\u00b7a2 + 2hl a1\u00b7a3 + 2kl a2\u00b7a3 )\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, a1, a2, a3 all have the same magnitude, a=10 Angstroms. The dot products a1\u00b7a2 = a\u00b2 cos \u03b1, etc.\n\nSo the magnitude squared is:\n\nh\u00b2 a\u00b2 +k\u00b2 a\u00b2 + l\u00b2 a\u00b2 + 2hk a\u00b2 cos \u03b1 + 2hl a\u00b2 cos \u03b2 + 2kl a\u00b2 cos \u03b3.\n\nSo the magnitude is a * sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nThe interplanar distance is the reciprocal of this magnitude divided by a. Wait, no, interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the normal vector divided by the area factor? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the formula for d is 1/|n|, where n is the normal vector in reciprocal space. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the normal vector in reciprocal space, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the interplanar distance is given by d = (a) / |n|, where |n| is the magnitude of the normal vector in real space.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it as:\n\nThe plane (hkl) has a normal vector n = h a1 + k a2 + l a3.\n\nThe interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of n.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. For a cubic system, the magnitude of n is sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 ) a. So d would be a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 ), which is correct.\n\nSo in general, d = a / sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 + 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nWhich brings me back to the same formula.\n\nSo with the given numbers, I must have made a mistake because the options don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let me try with 60 degrees.\n\ncos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator becomes:\n\n3 + 2*(3 * 0.5 )=3 +3=6.\n\nsqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10 /2.449\u22484.082 Angstroms.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 120 degrees, but that's unlikely since rhombohedral angles are either all acute or all obtuse.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(hk cos \u03b8 + hl cos \u03b8 + kl cos \u03b8) )\n\nWhich would be 3 - 2*(3 cos\u03b8 )\n\nSo for \u03b8=30\u00b0, 3 -6*(\u221a3/2)=3-3\u221a3\u22483-5.196\u2248-2.196. Negative, which can't be. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.\n\nWait, 10 / (sqrt(8.196) )=10/2.8628\u22483.493.\n\nBut none of the options are close. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWhich would be 3 - 2*3 * cos30 =3-6*(\u221a3/2)=3-3\u221a3\u2248-2.196. No, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWhich is what I did before. So perhaps the answer is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\nA)9.08\n\nB)8.95\n\nC)9.54\n\nD)10.05\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the denominator is actually (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWait, let's compute that.\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2=3.\n\n2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 =2*(3) * cos30=6*(\u221a3/2)=3\u221a3\u22485.196.\n\nSo denominator: 3 -5.196= -2.196. Which is negative. Impossible. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the denominator. So sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(...) )\n\nWait, that would be sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is using the reciprocal of the denominator, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nWhich would be 3 -3=0. So d is infinite, which can't be right.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me compute it again.\n\n3 + 6*(\u221a3/2)=3 +3\u221a3.\n\nWait, 3\u221a3=5.196152423.\n\n3+5.196152423=8.196152423.\n\nsqrt(8.196152423)=2.8628.\n\nSo d=10/2.8628\u22483.493.\n\nHmm. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the volume of the unit cell. The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b8 + 2 cos^3 \u03b8 )\n\nFor \u03b8=30\u00b0, cos\u03b8=\u221a3/2\u22480.866.\n\nSo compute 1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3.\n\n(0.866)^2\u22480.75.\n\n(0.866)^3\u22480.6495.\n\nSo 1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495)=1 -2.25 + 1.299= approx 0.049.\n\nSo sqrt(0.049)=0.221.\n\nSo V= a^3 *0.221=1000 *0.221=221 Angstrom^3.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps with the interplanar distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWhich is what I did. So I'm confident in the formula but not in the result matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the angles are 60 degrees. Let me try that.\n\ncos60=0.5.\n\nDenominator: 3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.\n\nsqrt(6)=2.449.\n\nd=10/2.449\u22484.082 Angstroms.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )\n\nWhich would be 3+6=9. So sqrt(9)=3. So d=10/3\u22483.333 Angstroms.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the denominator.\n\nWait, 10 * sqrt(8.196)=10 *2.8628\u224828.628. No, that's way too big.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ?\n\nFor (111), that would be 10/3\u22483.333. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h +k +l ), which for (111) would be 10/3\u22483.333. Still no match.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstroms, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 / (sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) ) ) * something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nWhich for (111) would be 3-3=0. No, that can't be.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nWhich would be 3+3=6. sqrt(6)=2.449. d=10/2.449\u22484.082.\n\nNo, not matching.\n\nI'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the formula. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for a rhombohedral system which is:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) + 2 (h k + h l + k l) cos \u03b8 )\n\nWhich gives d\u22483.493 Angstroms. But since the options don't include this, perhaps the correct answer is not among them. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a' but another parameter. Let me think: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, but the interatomic distance along the edges is 'a', so I think I'm correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the distance between adjacent planes, which could be the same as the interplanar distance. But I'm not sure.\n\nHmm. Since I can't find a way to get the options given, I'm probably missing something. Maybe the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator. Let me compute 10 * sqrt(8.196)=28.628. That's way too big. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.8628, so d=10/2.8628\u22483.493.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )\n\nWhich would be 3+6=9. So sqrt(9)=3. d=10/3\u22483.333.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculation I did, even though it doesn't match the options. But the options don't include that value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )\n\nWhich would be 3-3=0. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) which would be 10/3\u22483.333.\n\nNo match.\n\nHmm. I think I must have made a mistake, but I can't figure it out. Perhaps I'll choose the closest option, which isn't there. Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the denominator.\n\nWait, let me compute 3 +6*(\u221a3/2)=3+3\u221a3\u22488.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.8628. 10/2.8628=3.493.\n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but since the options don't include this, perhaps the question is incorrect.\n\nBut the options are all around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses a different 'a', such as the interatomic distance along a different axis. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a different crystal system.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * (1 + something) )\n\nBut without knowing the exact formula, I can't proceed.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation I have, but it doesn't match any of the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nd = (a) / sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +l\u00b2) - 2(hk cos \u03b1 + hl cos \u03b2 + kl cos \u03b3) )\n\nSo for our case:\n\n3 - 2*(3 * (\u221a3/2) )=3 -3\u221a3\u2248-2.196. Which is negative, so impossible.\n\nHmm. So I think I'm stuck and can't find the correct approach. Therefore, I'll have to choose the option that I think is correct based on the calculation, but since it's not present, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstroms, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me compute 3 +6*(\u221a3/2)=3 +3\u221a3\u22488.196.\n\nsqrt(8.196)=2.8628.\n\n10 /2.8628\u22483.493 Angstroms.\n\nHmm. I think I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't figure it out. Therefore, I'll proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question is incorrect.\n\n\nTo determine the interplanar distance \\( d \\) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \\( a = 10 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) and angles \\( \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\), the formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal system is used:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \\cos \\alpha + hl \\cos \\beta + kl \\cos \\gamma)}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Miller indices\nFor the (111) plane, \\( h = k = l = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula\nThe angles \\( \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma = 30^\\circ \\), so \\( \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 \\).\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \\cos \\alpha + hl \\cos \\beta + kl \\cos \\gamma)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( h = k = l = 1 \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ)}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3 + 2(3 \\cdot \\cos 30^\\circ)} = \\sqrt{3 + 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3 + 3\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the numerical value\nApproximate \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\):\n\\[\n3 + 3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3 + 3(1.732) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8.196} \\approx 2.8628\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( d \\)\n\\[\nd = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{8.196}} = \\frac{10}{2.8628} \\approx 3.493 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the options\nThe calculated interplanar distance \\( d \\approx 3.493 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\) does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9\u201310 \u00c5.
