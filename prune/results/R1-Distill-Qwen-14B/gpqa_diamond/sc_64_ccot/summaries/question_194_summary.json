      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state. The Boltzmann factor is e^(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). So each state contributes e^(-\u03b2E) to Z.\n\nNow, each spin can be either +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total. I'll need to list all the possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the possible values of the energy term. The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. \n\nSo let me think about how many terms there are. There are three terms: S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each can be +1 or -1. So the sum can vary. Let's consider different cases based on how many of the S_i S_j terms are +1 or -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the total number of +1 and -1 terms in each state.\n\nWait, another approach: the energy E can be written as -J times the sum of the three pairwise products. Let me denote each S_i as either +1 or -1, so each S_i S_j is +1 if they're the same, -1 otherwise.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote this sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H.\n\nSo for each state, H can take different values, and each H will contribute a term to Z.\n\nI need to find all possible values of H and how many states correspond to each H.\n\nLet me consider possible values of H. Each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum of three such terms can range from -3 to +3.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose all three terms are +1, then H = 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, H is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, H is -1. If all are -1, H is -3.\n\nSo possible H values are 3, 1, -1, -3. Now, how many states correspond to each H?\n\nWait, I think that's not the case. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the sum H can only take even or odd values? Let me think.\n\nWait, each S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So each term contributes either +1 or -1. So the sum H can be 3, 1, -1, -3. So yes, those four possibilities.\n\nNow, how many states correspond to each H?\n\nLet me think about when H=3. All three terms are +1, which means S1S2=1, S1S3=1, and S2S3=1. So each pair is the same. So all three spins must be the same. Because S1S2=1 implies S1=S2. Similarly, S1S3=1 implies S1=S3. So all three spins are the same. So either all +1 or all -1. So two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). So H=3 occurs in two states.\n\nWhat about H=-3? That would require all three terms to be -1. So S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Let's see: S1S2=-1 implies S1\u2260S2. Similarly, S1S3=-1 implies S1\u2260S3. So S2 and S3 must be the same (since S2S3=-1? Wait no, S2S3=-1 would mean S2\u2260S3. Wait, let's think:\n\nWait, H=-3 requires each term to be -1. So S1S2=-1 \u2192 S1\u2260S2.\n\nS1S3=-1 \u2192 S1\u2260S3.\n\nS2S3=-1 \u2192 S2\u2260S3.\n\nSo all three are different from each other. But wait, each spin can only be +1 or -1. So S1, S2, S3 must all be different? No, because there are only two possible values. So it's impossible for all three to be different. So H=-3 is impossible? Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. If all three terms are -1, that would require that S1\u2260S2, S1\u2260S3, and S2\u2260S3. But let's say S1 is +1, then S2 must be -1, S3 must be -1. But then S2 and S3 are both -1, so S2S3=1, which is not -1. That's a problem. So in this scenario, all three terms can't be -1. Therefore, H=-3 is impossible. So that's not a possible state.\n\nWait, so maybe H can only take 3, 1, -1. Because H=-3 is impossible. So let's check.\n\nWait, let's take a specific example. Let me consider S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then:\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother example: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3=1 \u2192 H = -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 H = -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, so how about H=3? That would be when all terms are +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Which implies all three spins are the same. So two states: all +1 or all -1.\n\nH=3 \u2192 2 states.\n\nNow, H=1: when two terms are +1 and one is -1. How many states have H=1?\n\nWait, let's see: for H=1, the sum is 1. That happens when two of the terms are +1 and one is -1. Let's see how many such states exist.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of the possible configurations. Let's think of the three terms as H = a + b + c, where each a, b, c is \u00b11. So for H=3, all a, b, c are +1. For H=1, two are +1 and one is -1. How many ways can that happen? There are three possibilities (each of a, b, c can be the one that is -1). For each such possibility, how many spin configurations give that particular a, b, c?\n\nWait, for example, if a=+1, b=+1, c=-1: what spin states would lead to that?\n\na = S1S2 = +1 \u2192 S1=S2.\n\nb = S1S3 = +1 \u2192 S1=S3.\n\nc = S2S3 = S1S3 = +1 \u2192 so c would be +1, but in this case, we have c=-1. So this situation is impossible. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the possible H values and the number of states for each.\n\nWait, another approach: for each possible state (each combination of S1, S2, S3), compute H and count how many times each H occurs.\n\nSince there are 8 possible states, let's list them all.\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1): All S_i = +1. Then each product S_iS_j = 1. So H = 3.\n\n2. (+1, +1, -1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. (+1, -1, +1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. H = -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\n4. (+1, -1, -1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. H = -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, no, let's compute each:\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = 1.\n\nS1S3 = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1).\n\nH = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nState 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1).\n\nS1S3= (+1).\n\nS2S3 = (-1).\n\nH = -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nState4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1).\n\nS1S3 = (-1).\n\nS2S3 = (+1) \u2192 because S2=-1, S3=-1: (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nSo H = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nState5: (-1, +1, +1): S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(+1)=1.\n\nH = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nState6: (-1, +1, -1): S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1) =-1.\n\nH= -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nState7: (-1, -1, +1): S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1.\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1.\n\nH=1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nState8: (-1, -1, -1): All -1. So each product is 1. H=3.\n\nWait a minute, so from the 8 states, only two have H=3 (states 1 and 8), and the other six have H=-1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because earlier I thought H could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But according to this, H can only be 3 or -1.\n\nWait, that's not possible. What am I missing?\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nWait, let's go through each state again:\n\nState1: (1,1,1) \u2192 H=3.\n\nState2: (1,1,-1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 H=1-1-1= -1.\n\nState3: (1,-1,1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 H= (-1)+(1)+(-1) = -1.\n\nState4: (1,-1,-1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 \u2192 H= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nState5: (-1,1,1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 \u2192 H= -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nState6: (-1,1,-1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 H= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nState7: (-1,-1,1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 H=1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nState8: (-1,-1,-1) \u2192 H=3.\n\nWait, so all the states except the two all-same states have H=-1. So H can only be 3 or -1. Oh, that's interesting. So H=3 occurs in two states, H=-1 occurs in six states.\n\nSo each state contributes a factor of e^{-\u03b2 E} = e^{ \u03b2 J H }, since E = -J H.\n\nWait, because E = -J H \u2192 \u03b2 E = -\u03b2 J H \u2192 e^{-\u03b2 E} = e^{ \u03b2 J H }.\n\nSo for H=3, each of the two states contributes e^{3 \u03b2 J }.\n\nFor H=-1, each of the six states contributes e^{ (-1) \u03b2 J } = e^{- \u03b2 J }.\n\nSo the partition function Z is sum over all states of e^{-\u03b2 E} = 2 * e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 * e^{ - \u03b2 J }.\n\nWait, wait, let me calculate this correctly.\n\nEach state with H=3 contributes e^{3 \u03b2 J}, and there are two such states \u2192 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J}.\n\nEach state with H=-1 contributes e^{-\u03b2 J}, and there are six such states \u2192 6 e^{-\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 No, because it's 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} and 6 e^{J\u03b2}.\n\nOption B) Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2) \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nOption C) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2) \u2192 No, exponents are wrong.\n\nOption D) Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2) \u2192 Also wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B.\n\n\nTo determine the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), each of which can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), we start with the energy expression:\n\n\\[\nE = -J \\left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\right).\n\\]\n\nThe partition function is given by:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\beta = 1 / (kT) \\). The energy \\( E \\) depends on the sum \\( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\), so \\( E = -JH \\). Thus, the Boltzmann factor becomes \\( e^{\\beta JH} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Possible values of \\( H \\)\nEach term \\( S_iS_j \\) can be \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), so \\( H \\) can take the values \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\).
