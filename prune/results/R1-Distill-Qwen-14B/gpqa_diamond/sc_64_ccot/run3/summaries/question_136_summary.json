      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r\u00b2. So, the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r\u00b2, and it only has a component in the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, \u2207\u00b7f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nHmm, right, so the main steps I think I should take are:\n\n1. Find the divergence of the vector field f(r).\n2. Set up the integral of this divergence over the volume of the sphere.\n3. Evaluate the integral and see which option matches.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how to compute the divergence in spherical coordinates. Oh right, because the field is given in spherical coordinates, using the radial direction only. So, the vector field f(r) can be written as f(r) er, where er is the unit radial vector. And since it's only radial, the other components (theta and phi) are zero.\n\nThe formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field A = A_r er + A_theta e_theta + A_phi e_phi is:\n\n\u2207\u00b7A = (1/r\u00b2) d(r\u00b2 A_r)/dr + (1/(r sin\u03b8)) d(A_theta sin\u03b8)/d\u03b8 + (1/(r sin\u03b8)) (1/ sin\u03b8) dA_phi/d\u03c6 )\n\nBut in this case, A_theta and A_phi are zero because the field is only radial. So, the divergence simplifies to (1/r\u00b2) d(r\u00b2 A_r)/dr.\n\nSo here, A_r is f(r) = 1/r\u00b2. So let's plug that in.\n\nCompute \u2207\u00b7f:\n\u2207\u00b7f = (1/r\u00b2) d/dr (r\u00b2 * (1/r\u00b2) )\n\nSimplify the expression inside the derivative: r\u00b2 * (1/r\u00b2) = 1. So,\n\n\u2207\u00b7f = (1/r\u00b2) * d(1)/dr = (1/r\u00b2) * 0 = 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Because when r is zero, the field isn't defined. So, in regions away from r=0, the divergence is zero.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the volume integral over a sphere of radius R. So if the divergence is zero everywhere inside (since R is just some finite radius away from zero), then the integral would be zero. But wait, no, that's not right because the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral is over a volume that includes the origin.\n\nWait, but wait again. Wait, the divergence is zero except at r=0, where the field might have a singularity. So, let's think about Gauss's Law. In electromagnetism, Gauss's Law says that the integral of the divergence of E over a volume is equal to the enclosed charge. For a point charge, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, but the integral over any volume enclosing the origin gives a non-zero value, like 4\u03c0 times the charge.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the divergence is zero except at r=0. So when I integrate over the sphere of radius R, which includes r=0, the integral would be... hmm.\n\nWait, let me re-express the divergence. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the divergence. Let me double-check.\n\nThe vector field is f(r) = (1/r\u00b2) er.\n\nSo A_r = 1/r\u00b2.\n\nThen, the divergence in spherical coordinates is:\n\n(1/r\u00b2) d/dr (r\u00b2 A_r )\n\nSo substituting A_r:\n\n(1/r\u00b2) d/dr (r\u00b2 * (1/r\u00b2)) = (1/r\u00b2) d/dr (1) = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the function isn't defined. So, in the region r>0, the divergence is zero.\n\nWait, but then the integral of the divergence over any volume that doesn't include r=0 would be zero. But if the sphere includes r=0 (since R>0), then what's the integral? Because in the neighborhood around r=0, the divergence might have a delta function or something.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the divergence theorem here. The divergence theorem states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface S enclosing V.\n\nSo, if I apply the divergence theorem to the sphere of radius R, then:\n\n\u222b\u222b\u222b (\u2207\u00b7f) dV = \u222b\u222b f \u00b7 dS\n\nWhere the surface integral is over the sphere of radius R.\n\nWhat's f on the surface? On the surface, r = R, so f(R) = 1/(R\u00b2) in the radial direction. The differential surface element dS in spherical coordinates is R\u00b2 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 times the outward normal vector (which is er). So f \u00b7 dS would be (1/R\u00b2) * R\u00b2 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 = sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6.\n\nSo the surface integral becomes the integral over the sphere of sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6.\n\nWhich is:\n\n\u222b (\u03b8=0 to \u03c0) \u222b (\u03c6=0 to 2\u03c0) sin\u03b8 d\u03c6 d\u03b8\n\n= \u222b0^2\u03c0 d\u03c6 \u222b0^\u03c0 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8\n\n= 2\u03c0 [ -cos\u03b8 ] from 0 to \u03c0\n\n= 2\u03c0 [ (-cos \u03c0) + cos 0 ]\n\n= 2\u03c0 [ (-(-1)) + 1 ] = 2\u03c0 (1 +1) = 4\u03c0.\n\nSo according to the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4\u03c0.\n\nWait, but wait. If the divergence inside is zero except at the origin, but the surface integral gives 4\u03c0, that suggests that the volume integral is 4\u03c0. But according to my earlier calculation, the divergence is zero inside, which would imply the integral is zero. So something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the confusion. The divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the volume integral of the divergence is zero because the divergence is zero in the region r>0. But according to the divergence theorem, the integral is 4\u03c0. So that suggests that there's a delta function at r=0. So the divergence isn't just zero everywhere; it's a delta function at the origin.\n\nWait, perhaps the field f(r) is similar to the electric field of a point charge. For example, Coulomb's law E(r) = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b50)) (q/r\u00b2) er. The divergence of E is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the integral over any volume enclosing the origin is (q/(\u03b50)).\n\nIn our case, the field is f(r) = 1/r\u00b2 er, which is similar to E with q/(4\u03c0\u03b50) = 1. So the flux through the surface would be 4\u03c0, implying that the integral of the divergence is 4\u03c0.\n\nBut wait, according to the divergence theorem, the integral of \u2207\u00b7f over the volume is equal to the flux. So in this case, the flux is 4\u03c0, so the volume integral must be 4\u03c0, even though the divergence is zero everywhere except at a point.\n\nSo the volume integral \u222b\u222b\u222b (\u2207\u00b7f) dV = 4\u03c0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the divergence was zero everywhere. So perhaps the divergence is a delta function at the origin. Because for a point charge, \u2207\u00b7E is 4\u03c0\u03b4\u00b3(r), so integrating that over any volume enclosing the origin gives 4\u03c0.\n\nSo in this problem, since the vector field is f(r) = (1/r\u00b2) er, perhaps \u2207\u00b7f is 4\u03c0 \u03b4\u00b3(r).\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute the divergence again.\n\n\u2207\u00b7f = (1/r\u00b2) d/dr (r\u00b2 * (1/r\u00b2)) ) = (1/r\u00b2) d(1)/dr = 0. So the divergence is zero for r\u22600, but at r=0, there's a singularity. So the divergence is a delta function scaled by 4\u03c0.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think about the divergence in terms of distribution. The divergence of f(r) is zero everywhere except at the origin. But when you integrate the divergence over any volume that includes the origin, you get 4\u03c0. So the divergence is 4\u03c0 \u03b4\u00b3(r).\n\nSo the volume integral of \u2207\u00b7f over the sphere of radius R is 4\u03c0.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 4\u03c0, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the integral of the divergence inside the sphere is equal to the flux through the surface, which we calculated as 4\u03c0. So the integral is 4\u03c0, regardless of the divergence being zero elsewhere. Because the divergence includes a delta function at the origin, which contributes to the integral.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A) 4\u03c0.\n\n\nThe problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius \\( R \\) centered at the origin. The vector field is given as \\( f(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\hat{e}_r \\), where \\( \\hat{e}_r \\) is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates, and it has no components in the \\( \\hat{e}_\\theta \\) or \\( \\hat{e}_\\phi \\) directions.\n\n### Step 1: Compute the divergence of \\( f(r) \\)\nIn spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field \\( \\mathbf{A} = A_r \\hat{e}_r + A_\\theta \\hat{e}_\\theta + A_\\phi \\hat{e}_\\phi \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 A_r \\right) + \\frac{1}{r \\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( A_\\theta \\sin\\theta \\right) + \\frac{1}{r \\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial A_\\phi}{\\partial \\phi}.\n\\]\nSince \\( f(r) \\) has only a radial component (\\( A_r = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\)) and \\( A_\\theta = A_\\phi = 0 \\), the divergence simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot f = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right).\n\\]\nSimplifying inside the derivative:\n\\[\nr^2 \\frac{1}{r^2} = 1,\n\\]\nso:\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot f = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} (1) = 0.\n\\]\nThus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at \\( r = 0 \\), where the field has a singularity.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the volume integral of \\( \\nabla \\cdot f \\)\nThe volume integral of \\( \\nabla \\cdot f \\) over the sphere of radius \\( R \\) is:\n\\[\n\\int_V (\\nabla \\cdot f) \\, dV.\n\\]\nSince \\( \\nabla \\cdot f = 0 \\) for \\( r \\neq 0 \\), the integral over the volume is dominated by the singularity at \\( r = 0 \\). To handle this, we use the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of \\( f \\) through the surface of the sphere:\n\\[\n\\int_V (\\nabla \\cdot f) \\, dV = \\int_S f \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the flux through the surface\nThe surface of the sphere is parameterized in spherical coordinates, with \\( r = R \\), \\( \\hat{e}_r \\) as the outward normal, and \\( d\\mathbf{S} = R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, \\hat{e}_r \\). The vector field on the surface is \\( f(R) = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\hat{e}_r \\). The flux is:\n\\[\n\\int_S f \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\int_S \\frac{1}{R^2} \\cdot R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = \\int_S \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi.\n\\]\nBreaking this into angular integrals:\n\\[\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta.\n\\]\nThe \\( \\phi \\)-integral gives \\( 2\\pi \\), and the \\( \\theta \\)-integral gives:\n\\[\n\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = 2.\n\\]\nThus, the flux is:\n\\[\n2\\pi \\cdot 2 = 4\\pi.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe volume integral of \\( \\nabla \\cdot f \\) over the sphere of radius \\( R \\) is equal to the flux through the surface, which is \\( 4\\pi \\). This result arises because the divergence of \\( f(r) \\) includes a delta function at the origin, contributing to the integral even though \\( \\nabla \\cdot f = 0 \\) elsewhere.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**A) 4\u03c0**",
