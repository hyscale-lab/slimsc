      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, to have a value of 0 at a given time. \n\nAlright, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think that's a vector in three-dimensional space. And the observable P is a matrix operator. Wait, I remember that observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities.\n\nSo the matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. The third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Let me write that out to visualize it better.\n\nP =\n[ 0       1/\u221a2    0 ]\n[1/\u221a2    0      1/\u221a2]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2   0 ]\n\nWait, wait. I'm a bit confused. Oh right, in matrix notation, each row is a row, so the first row is the first element, and the columns correspond to the components. So P is a 3x3 matrix.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as a column vector \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the magnitudes equals 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. That might be important.\n\nWait, but when calculating probabilities, do I need to normalize the state first? Because if I don't, the probabilities might not sum to 1. Let me think. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector. So I need to normalize \u03c8. So I'll have to divide each component by sqrt(6). So the actual state is \u03c8 = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't mention normalizing. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without it, but I'm not sure. Wait, the observable is P, and the measurement outcome is 0. So the probability is the sum over the square of the amplitudes where P has eigenvalue 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, and see which eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalue 0. Then, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component of \u03c8 along that eigenvector.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to think of P as a projection operator. Because the matrix looks symmetric and has elements with 1/sqrt(2). Let me compute the eigenvalues of P.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - \u03bb I) = 0.\n\nLet me write the matrix (P - \u03bb I):\n\n[ -\u03bb       1/\u221a2     0      ]\n[1/\u221a2     -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    ]\n[ 0       1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      ]\n\nHmm, calculating the determinant might be a bit tedious, but let's try. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be found using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\n-\u03bb * det [ [-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2], [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb] ] \n- 1/\u221a2 * det [ [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2], [0, -\u03bb] ]\n+ 0 * something.\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb [ ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) ) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nThe second term is -1/\u221a2 * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ]\n= -1/\u221a2 * [ (-\u03bb / \u221a2) ] \n= -1/\u221a2 * (-\u03bb / \u221a2 ) \n= (\u03bb) / 2\n\nThe third term is 0, so we can ignore it.\n\nSo the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nExpanding that:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = 0\n\nWait, let me compute each part correctly. First term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2). Second term: + (\u03bb/2). So summing, -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nSo the equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0.\n\nFactor this: \u03bb (-\u03bb^2 +1 ) =0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb^2) )=0.\n\nSo the solutions are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck the determinant calculation. I might have made a mistake in the signs.\n\nWait, the expansion is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ ( -\u03bb * -\u03bb ) - (1/\u221a2 * 1/\u221a2) ) ] \n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nThen the second term is - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by the determinant of the minor, which is the element at (1,2). So the minor is the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing first row and second column. So the minor is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) )= -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by this determinant, but wait, the cofactor sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) * (-1).\n\nWait, no. The cofactor is (-1)^(i+j) times the minor determinant. For element (1,2), i=1, j=2. So (-1)^(3) = -1.\n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * ( -\u03bb /\u221a2 ) \u2192 because the minor determinant is (-\u03bb/\u221a2).\n\nSo that would be (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nWait, so the second term is positive \u03bb/2.\n\nSo putting it all together, the determinant equation is:\n\n-\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ) + \u03bb/2 =0 \u2192 -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb ( -\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, observables must have real eigenvalues, which they do here. So the possible outcomes for P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nBut the problem asks for the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, and then compute the projection of the state \u03c8 onto that eigenvector.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v =0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nRow 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nRow 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)(v1 + v3) =0 \u2192 v1 + v3=0 \u2192 v3= -v1.\n\nRow 3: 0 v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0 v3=0 \u2192 again, v2=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector v has v2=0, v3= -v1. Let v1 = a, then v3 = -a.\n\nSo the eigenvector is [ a, 0, -a ]^T. We can choose a=1, so v = [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nBut wait, we can also normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nWait, but the state vector given is \u03c8 = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Wait, no, I think I should have normalized it first. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors. So the given state is not normalized. So I should normalize it before proceeding.\n\nSo the original \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is \u03c8_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nNow, the eigenvector for P=0 is [1, 0, -1]^T. But we can write it as a vector, say, e = [1, 0, -1]^T. To find the probability, we compute the inner product of \u03c8_normalized and e, then take the square of its magnitude.\n\nWait, but actually, the eigenvector e might not be normalized. So I should normalize it as well. The norm of e is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is e_normalized = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.\n\nSo the inner product is \u03c8_normalized \u00b7 e_normalized.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n\u03c8_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\ne_normalized = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].\n\nDot product: ( -1/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo that's [ (-1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nWhich is [ (-1 -1) ] / (sqrt(12) ) \u2192 (-2) / (2 sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 because sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square of the magnitude is ( (-1)/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Because I'm getting a bit confused with all the normalization steps.\n\nAlternative approach: The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo, without normalizing \u03c8 first, the inner product is \u03c8 \u00b7 e, where e is [1,0,-1]^T.\n\n\u03c8 is [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nInner product: (-1)(1) + 2*(0) + 1*(-1) )= (-1) +0 + (-1) = -2.\n\nThe magnitude squared is (-2)^2 =4.\n\nBut wait, the state \u03c8 isn't normalized. The probability is (|inner product|\u00b2 ) / (norm(\u03c8)^2) ), because the state isn't normalized.\n\nBecause in quantum mechanics, the probability is |\u27e8e|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, but if \u03c8 is not normalized, then you have to divide by ||\u03c8||\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The state vector must be normalized. If it isn't, the probabilities won't sum to 1. So the correct approach is to first normalize \u03c8.\n\nSo, the inner product without normalization is -2. The norm of \u03c8 is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is \u03c8_normalized = \u03c8 / sqrt(6).\n\nThe normalized eigenvector e is e_normalized = e / sqrt(2), since e has norm sqrt(2).\n\nSo the inner product is (\u03c8_normalized) \u00b7 (e_normalized) )= [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ]\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6) sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= [ (-1 -1) ] / (sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square is (1/3).\n\nSo the probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the inner product. Let me recheck. The eigenvector e is [1,0,-1]^T. The state \u03c8 is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nSo, the inner product is (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 +0 -1 = -2.\n\nBut the eigenvector e is not normalized. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized e is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1]^T.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c8's norm is sqrt(6), so normalized \u03c8 is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].\n\nSo the inner product is [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ].\n\nWhich is (-1/(sqrt(12)) ) + (-1/(sqrt(12)) ) \u2192 (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) \u2192 (-1)/sqrt(3).\n\nThe square is 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) to yield 0 for a given state vector.
