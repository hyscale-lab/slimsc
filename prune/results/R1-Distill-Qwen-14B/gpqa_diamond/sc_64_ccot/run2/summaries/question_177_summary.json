      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, the question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, the question is about luminosity, right?\n\nThe astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember that the peak wavelength is related to the temperature of the star. Wien's Law, which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is same, T is same.\n\nWait, but how about the radial velocities? Star_1 has radial velocity 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh right, because if a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are same, but their intrinsic (rest frame) temperatures might differ. Or maybe the radial velocities are used for something else in the problem.\n\nWait, the question says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So they assume blackbody radiation, which means L is determined by radius, temperature, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nWait, Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074. So luminosity depends on R squared and T to the fourth power.\n\nBut earlier, we thought that the peak wavelengths are same. But wait, the observed peak wavelengths would be affected by the Doppler shift. So the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths would be different if their velocities are different. Or wait, no, because the observed wavelength is a combination of the rest wavelength and the Doppler shift.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the rest frame. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. But that could be either their rest wavelengths or the observed ones. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" So, I think it's the observed wavelength. So the observed lambda_max is same for both stars.\n\nBut the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ), approximately, if velocities are much smaller than c. Or wait, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r/c), assuming v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, that's the non-relativistic approximation. However, 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so 700 is about 0.0023c, which is small, so non-relativistic approximation might be okay.\n\nWait, but let me get back to the main point. The peak wavelengths observed are same, so lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.\n\nBut lambda_obs is the Doppler shifted version of the rest frame lambda. So lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c). But wait, if a star is moving towards us (v_r negative?), then the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted). So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which direction is it moving? The problem says 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_1 is at rest (v_r=0), Star_2 has v_r=700. So if it's moving towards us, its observed wavelength would be blueshifted. If moving away, redshifted.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the direction, just the magnitude. Hmm. Wait, but the observed peak wavelengths are same. So the rest wavelengths must be different, because their observed lambda_max are same, but their velocities are different.\n\nWait, let me think again. The observed peak wavelengths are same. So for each star, lambda_obs is same as the other's. So:\n\nlambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.\n\nBut lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c) [assuming v_r is positive when moving away, but I might have the sign wrong. Let me think: if the star is moving away, the light is redshifted, so lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive for recession. If moving towards, v_r is negative, so lambda_obs would be smaller.]\n\nSo, for Star_1: lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest * (1 + v1_r / c).\n\nFor Star_2: lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c).\n\nBut since v1_r is 0, lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.\n\nAnd Star_2's v_r is 700 km/s. Let's say Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive). Then lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + 700/c). But since lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs,\n\nlambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + 700/c).\n\nAlternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r would be negative, so lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 - 700/c). Then, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 - 700/c).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the peak wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are same. So regardless of direction, the observed lambda_max is same.\n\nBut the problem is, the stars' rest wavelengths (lambda_rest) would be different, which relates to their temperatures. Because from Wien's law, lambda_rest = b / T.\n\nSo, since lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c), but wait, let me re-express.\n\nWait, no, wait: For Star_2, the observed lambda is lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, v_r2 is positive, so lambda_2_obs is longer than lambda_2_rest. For Star_1, lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest, since v_r1=0.\n\nBut the observed lambdas are the same, so lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nBut since lambda_rest is related to temperature, T_rest = b / lambda_rest.\n\nSo T_1_rest = b / lambda_1_rest.\n\nT_2_rest = b / lambda_2_rest.\n\nFrom above, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c). So,\n\nT_1_rest = (b) / [ lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c) ) ].\n\nBut T_2_rest = b / lambda_2_rest.\n\nSo T_1_rest = T_2_rest / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write it again:\n\nlambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nSo,\n\nT_1_rest = b / lambda_1_rest = b / [ lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c) ]\n\nBut T_2_rest = b / lambda_2_rest.\n\nSo,\n\nT_1_rest = T_2_rest / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nSo, T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074.\n\nSo, for Star_1, L1 = 4\u03c0 R1\u00b2 \u03c3 T1^4.\n\nFor Star_2, L2 = 4\u03c0 R2\u00b2 \u03c3 T2^4.\n\nThe ratio L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1^4) / (R2\u00b2 T2^4).\n\nGiven that R1 is 1.5 R2.\n\nSo R1 = 1.5 R2.\n\nSo,\n\nL1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T1^4) ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) )\n\n= (2.25 R2\u00b2) * (T1^4) / (R2\u00b2 T2^4 )\n\n= 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.\n\nSo, we need to compute (T1/T2)^4.\n\nFrom earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nSo,\n\nT1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nBut wait, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute this.\n\nv_r2 = 700 km/s.\n\nc is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.\n\nSo v_r2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) \u2248 0.023333.\n\nSo,\n\nT1/T2 = 1 / (1 + 0.023333) \u2248 1 / 1.023333 \u2248 0.977.\n\nSo, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 (0.977)^4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n0.977^2 = approx (1 - 0.023)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.046 + 0.0005 \u2248 0.9545.\n\nSo, 0.977^4 = (0.9545)^2 \u2248 0.910.\n\nWait, let's compute it more accurately.\n\n0.977^2:\n\n0.977 * 0.977.\n\nCompute 977 * 977.\n\nWell, 977 * 977 = (1000 - 23)^2 = 1000\u00b2 - 2*1000*23 +23\u00b2 = 1e6 -46,000 + 529 = 954,529.\n\nSo, 0.977^2 = 0.954529.\n\nThen, 0.954529^2.\n\nCompute 0.95^2 is 0.9025. But 0.954529 is a bit higher, so the square will be a bit higher than 0.9025.\n\nCompute (0.954529)^2.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n0.954529 * 0.954529.\n\nI can approximate it as (0.95 + 0.004529)^2.\n\n= 0.95\u00b2 + 2*0.95*0.004529 + (0.004529)^2.\n\n0.95\u00b2 = 0.9025.\n\n2*0.95*0.004529 = 1.9 * 0.004529 \u2248 0.008605.\n\n(0.004529)^2 \u2248 0.0000205.\n\nAdding up: 0.9025 + 0.008605 = 0.911105 + 0.0000205 = approx 0.9111255.\n\nSo, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.9111.\n\nSo, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9111.\n\n2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.\n\n2.25 * 0.0111 \u2248 0.025.\n\nTotal approx 2.025 + 0.025 = 2.05.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9111 more accurately.\n\n2.25 * 0.9111 = ?\n\n2 * 0.9111 = 1.8222.\n\n0.25 * 0.9111 = 0.227775.\n\nAdding: 1.8222 + 0.227775 = 2.05 (exactly, 2.05 is 2.05, but precise value is 2.05 approx. But wait, 0.9111 is approximately 0.9111, so 2.25 * 0.9111 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.25 * 0.9111.\n\n2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.\n\n2.25 * 0.0111 = 0.025. So total is 2.05.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 0.954529^2 is about 0.9111, so (T1/T2)^4 is 0.9111.\n\nSo, L1/L2 is 2.25 * 0.9111 = approximately 2.05.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options:\n\nOptions are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.\n\nHmm, 2.05 is not in the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the Doppler effect wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nIf Star_2 is moving towards us, then the observed wavelength would be shorter, so lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 - v_r2/c), assuming v_r2 is positive when moving away. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda would be smaller.\n\nBut in the problem, both observed lambda_max are same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed lambda is shorter than its rest lambda. So for Star_1, which is at rest, lambda_1_rest = lambda_1_obs.\n\nStar_2's lambda_obs is same as Star_1's lambda_obs. So,\n\nlambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 - v_r2/c) = lambda_1_rest = lambda_1_rest.\n\nSo, lambda_2_rest = lambda_1_rest / (1 - v_r2/c).\n\nWait, that's different from earlier. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r is negative, so the formula would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is negative (since moving towards, v_r is negative).\n\nWait, let me clarify the Doppler shift formula. The relativistic Doppler effect is:\n\nlambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt[ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ] where beta is v/c (for motion directly away or towards). But in the non-relativistic case, it's approximately 1 + v_r/c.\n\nWait, but for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is lambda_obs = lambda_rest (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the object is moving away, v_r is positive, so lambda_obs is longer. If moving towards, v_r is negative, so lambda_obs is shorter.\n\nIn our case, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1, and 700 km/s for Star_2. But it doesn't specify the direction. So perhaps the velocities are such that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a redshift. But then, if Star_1 is at rest and Star_2 is moving away, their observed lambdas are same. So,\n\nlambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.\n\nlambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nSince lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs,\n\nlambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nSo,\n\nlambda_1_rest / lambda_2_rest = 1 + v_r2/c.\n\nWhich is,\n\n(T2_rest / T1_rest) = 1 + v_r2/c.\n\nBecause lambda is inversely proportional to T (Wien's law).\n\nSo,\n\nT1_rest = T2_rest / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).\n\nBut v_r2 is 700 km/s, so v_r2/c is 0.0023333.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + v_r2/c = 1.0023333.\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T2 / 1.0023333 \u2248 0.99768 * T2.\n\nSo,\n\n(T1 / T2) = 0.99768.\n\nSo,\n\n(T1 / T2)^4 \u2248 (0.99768)^4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n0.99768^2 = approx (1 - 0.00232)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 \u2248 0.99336.\n\nThen, (0.99336)^2 = approx (1 - 0.00664)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.00664 + (0.00664)^2 \u2248 0.9868.\n\nSo,\n\n(T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.9868.\n\nSo,\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9868 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9868.\n\nCompute 2.25 * 0.9868.\n\n2 * 0.9868 = 1.9736.\n\n0.25 * 0.9868 = 0.2467.\n\nTotal is 1.9736 + 0.2467 = 2.2203.\n\nSo approximately 2.22.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is close. Option A is ~2.25, which is higher.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute more accurately.\n\nLet me compute (0.99768)^4.\n\nCompute 0.99768^2:\n\n0.99768 * 0.99768.\n\nLet me calculate it as (1 - 0.00232)^2.\n\n= 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2.\n\n= 1 - 0.00464 + 0.00000538.\n\n= 0.99536538.\n\nThen, (0.99536538)^2.\n\nAgain, (1 - 0.00463462)^2.\n\n= 1 - 2*0.00463462 + (0.00463462)^2.\n\n= 1 - 0.00926924 + 0.00002147.\n\n= 0.99075223.\n\nSo, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.99075.\n\nThus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 \u2248 2.25 * 0.99075.\n\n2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.\n\n2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.\n\nAdding: 2.2275 + 0.0016875 \u2248 2.2291875.\n\nSo approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is ~2.23.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the direction of velocity affects the calculation, but in the problem statement, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. If Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive), then our calculation holds. But if it's moving towards, then the formula would be different. Let me check.\n\nIf Star_2 is moving towards us, then v_r is negative. So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r/c). v_r is negative, so 1 + v_r/c is less than 1. So, lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 - |v_r|/c).\n\nSo, in that case, for Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 - 700/c).\n\nAnd Star_1's lambda_obs is lambda_1_rest.\n\nSo, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 - 700/c).\n\nSo,\n\nlambda_1_rest / lambda_2_rest = 1 - 700/c.\n\nWhich implies,\n\n(T2_rest / T1_rest) = 1 - 700/c.\n\nSo,\n\nT1_rest = T2_rest / (1 - 700/c).\n\nWait, wait, because lambda is inversely proportional to T.\n\nSo,\n\nlambda_1_rest = (b)/T1_rest.\n\nlambda_2_rest = (b)/T2_rest.\n\nSo,\n\nlambda_1_rest = (b)/T1.\n\nlambda_2_rest = (b)/T2.\n\nSo,\n\nlambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 - 700/c).\n\nWhich gives,\n\n(b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 - 700/c).\n\nCancel b,\n\n1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 - 700/c).\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T2 / (1 - 700/c).\n\nWait, 700/c is 0.0023333.\n\nSo,\n\n1 - 700/c = 0.9976667.\n\nSo,\n\nT1 = T2 / 0.9976667 \u2248 T2 * 1.00234.\n\nSo,\n\n(T1/T2) = 1.00234.\n\nThen,\n\n(T1/T2)^4 \u2248 (1.00234)^4.\n\nCompute that.\n\n1.00234^2 = approx (1 + 0.00234)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 \u2248 1.00468 + 0.000005476 \u2248 1.004685.\n\nThen, (1.004685)^2 = approx (1 + 0.004685)^2 \u2248 1 + 2*0.004685 + (0.004685)^2 \u2248 1.00937 + 0.00002195 \u2248 1.00939.\n\nSo, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 1.00939.\n\nSo, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00939 \u2248 2.25 * 1.0094 \u2248 2.272.\n\nBut that's about 2.27, which isn't one of the options. The options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. It doesn't say which direction. So which scenario is correct?\n\nHmm, the problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700. The observed peak wavelengths are same. So the Doppler shift would affect the observed lambda, so the rest lambda would be different. But without knowing the direction, perhaps we can't proceed? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the problem says the observed wavelengths are same. So, regardless of direction, the Doppler shift leads to the same observed lambda. So, perhaps the calculation would depend on whether the star is moving towards or away.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's assumed that the velocity is away. Because otherwise, the problem would have given more info.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift effect is negligible, and the temperatures are same. But no, because the velocities are 700 km/s, which is a small fraction of c, but not negligible for precise calculations.\n\nWait, but the problem says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. So perhaps the rest wavelengths are same, and the Doppler shift is negligible. But that would imply that the temperatures are same.\n\nWait, no, because if the velocities are 700 km/s, then the Doppler shift is non-negligible for precise measurements. So the rest wavelengths must be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the problem. Let me think again.\n\nThe observed lambda_max is same for both stars.\n\nSo, for Star_1 (v_r1=0):\n\nlambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.\n\nFor Star_2 (v_r2=700 km/s):\n\nlambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c) if moving away, or (1 - v_r2/c) if moving towards.\n\nBut since observed lambdas are same,\n\nlambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c) if Star_2 is moving away.\n\nOR,\n\nlambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 - v_r2/c) if Star_2 is moving towards.\n\nBut in either case, the ratio of the rest lambdas would be either (1 + v/c) or (1 - v/c).\n\nWhich would affect the temperature ratio.\n\nBut without knowing the direction, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same intrinsic temperature, making the observed lambda same despite Doppler shift. But that would require specific velocities, but the problem doesn't state that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't consider the Doppler effect and assumes that the stars have the same temperature. But that can't be right because their observed lambda_max are same, but their rest wavelengths would be same only if the Doppler shift doesn't affect it, which would require v_r2=0, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a redshift.\n\nSo, in that case, the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards us, the ratio is higher, about 2.27, which isn't an option. So the problem probably assumes that Star_2 is moving away, making the correct answer D, ~2.23.\n\n\nTo determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:\n\n\\[\nL = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\n\\]\n\nThe luminosity ratio is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Relating the temperatures\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}\\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{b}{T}\\)) and the Doppler shift formula (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} (1 + v_r/c)\\)), we relate the rest wavelengths and temperatures.\n\nFor Star_1 (at rest, \\(v_{r1} = 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{1,\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{1,\\text{rest}}\n\\]\n\nFor Star_2 (\\(v_{r2} = 700 \\, \\text{km/s}\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{2,\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{2,\\text{rest}} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\lambda_{1,\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{2,\\text{obs}}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{1,\\text{rest}} = \\lambda_{2,\\text{rest}} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{b}{T}\\), the temperature ratio becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_{r2} = 700 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) and \\(c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \\frac{700}{300,000} \\approx 0.002333\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \\approx 0.99768\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the luminosity ratio\nThe radius of Star_1 is \\(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\\). Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{(R_1)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\cdot (0.99768)^4\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\((1.5)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\((0.99768)^4\\). Approximating:\n\n\\[\n(0.99768)^2 \\approx 0.99537, \\quad (0.99537)^2 \\approx 0.99075\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\cdot 0.99075 \\approx 2.229\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Comparing with the options\nThe closest option to \\(2.229\\) is:\n\n**D) ~2.23**\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The stars' brightest wavelengths are the same, which probably means their temperatures are the same because the peak wavelength of a black body is determined by its temperature (Wien's Law). Oh right, Wien's Law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, so same lambda_max implies same temperature.\n\nThey also mention radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. How does that affect luminosity?\n\nBut wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So I think the key here is the luminosity formula for a black body.\n\nLuminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where R is radius, T is temperature, and \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nSince both stars are black bodies, their luminosities depend on R\u00b2 and T\u2074.\n\nFrom the problem, R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 because their peak emission wavelengths are the same. So let's plug into the luminosity formula.\n\nL1 = 4\u03c0 (R1)^2 \u03c3 T1^4\nL2 = 4\u03c0 (R2)^2 \u03c3 T2^4\n\nSince T1 = T2, we can write L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the ratio would be 2.25, which is option A.\n\nWait, but why is the radial velocity mentioned? Oh, perhaps it's a red herring or maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting observed wavelengths, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So regardless of their velocities, their emission peaks are measured at the same lambda. That suggests that the temperatures are the same in their rest frames. Because if a star is moving towards us, its emission would be blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But since the peak wavelengths are the same, it implies that the temperatures are the same, regardless of their velocities. Because the observed wavelength is a combination of the star's temperature and its velocity. But wait, maybe the radial velocities affect the observed flux or something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocities are to do with Doppler shifting the observed brightness, but the problem says the stars' apparent brightness maxima are at the same wavelength. So perhaps the temperature as measured from the peak is the same, but their actual temperatures might differ because of their velocities. Hmm, but I'm not sure. The problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so I think the luminosity is computed based on their actual (intrinsic) properties, not the observed ones.\n\nWait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So the observed wavelength maximum is the same for both. But if the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. So the intrinsic temperature would be different.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same for both. But the actual (intrinsic) lambda_max would be different if their velocities are different. Because, for example, if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its emission would be blueshifted, making the observed lambda_max shorter than its actual. Similarly, Star_1's observed lambda_max would be longer or shorter depending on its velocity. But wait, Star_1's velocity is zero, so its observed lambda_max is the same as its intrinsic. Star_2 has a velocity, so its observed lambda_max is different from its intrinsic.\n\nBut the problem states that the observed lambda_max is the same for both. So, for Star_1: observed lambda_max1 = intrinsic lambda_max1 (since v=0). For Star_2: observed lambda_max2 = intrinsic lambda_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) because of relativistic Doppler shift. But v is 700 km/s, which is much less than c (since c is about 3e5 km/s), so we can approximate the Doppler factor as (1 + v/c), since for small v, the relativistic Doppler shift is approximately 1 + v/c for recession.\n\nWait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter. So the observed lambda_max for Star_2 is lambda_max2 * (1 + v/c), but wait, actually, the Doppler formula for wavelength when moving towards us (blueshift) is lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v/c. Since v is 700 km/s, beta is 700/(3e5) \u2248 0.002333.\n\nSo sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) \u2248 sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) ) \u2248 sqrt(0.99537) \u2248 0.99768.\n\nSo the observed lambda_max for Star_2 is lambda_max2 * 0.99768.\n\nBut the problem says that the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So:\n\nlambda_obs1 = lambda1 (since v1=0)\nlambda_obs2 = lambda2 * 0.99768\n\nGiven that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2:\n\nlambda1 = lambda2 * 0.99768\n\nSo lambda1 = 0.99768 * lambda2.\n\nBut lambda is proportional to 1/T, so:\n\nlambda1 / lambda2 = T2 / T1 = 0.99768\n\nSo T2 = T1 * 0.99768\n\nWait, but that's a very small difference. So the temperatures aren't exactly the same. So when we compute luminosity, which depends on T, this difference matters.\n\nSo, let's compute L1 and L2.\n\nL1 = 4\u03c0 R1\u00b2 \u03c3 T1\u2074\nL2 = 4\u03c0 R2\u00b2 \u03c3 T2\u2074\n\nWe know R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 = T1 * 0.99768.\n\nSo,\n\nL1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1^4 ) / ( R2\u00b2 T2^4 )\n= ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2\u00b2 * (0.99768 T1)^4 )\n= ( (2.25 R2\u00b2) * T1^4 ) / ( R2\u00b2 * (0.99768^4 T1^4) )\n= 2.25 / (0.99768^4 )\n\nCalculate 0.99768^4:\n\nLet me compute this. 0.99768 is approximately 0.99768 \u2248 1 - 0.00232.\n\nWe can approximate (1 - x)^n \u2248 1 - nx when x is small.\n\nSo (0.99768)^4 \u2248 1 - 4*(0.00232) = 1 - 0.00928 = 0.99072.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 0.99768^2 first.\n\n0.99768^2 \u2248 (1 - 0.00232)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*(0.00232) + (0.00232)^2 \u2248 0.99536 + 0.00000538 \u2248 0.995365.\n\nThen square that to get the fourth power.\n\n(0.995365)^2 \u2248 (1 - 0.004635)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*(0.004635) + (0.004635)^2 \u2248 0.99073 + 0.00002146 \u2248 0.99075.\n\nSo 0.99768^4 \u2248 approximately 0.99075.\n\nSo L1/L2 = 2.25 / 0.99075 \u2248 2.25 / 0.99075 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n2.25 divided by 0.99075.\n\nWell, 0.99075 is approximately 0.99075 = 1 - 0.00925.\n\n2.25 / 0.99075 = approximately 2.25 * (1 / 0.99075) \u2248 2.25 * 1.0093 \u2248 2.2709.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) ~2.25\n\nB) ~2.32\n\nC) ~2.35\n\nD) ~2.23\n\nHmm, so approximately 2.27, but that's not one of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 2.25 / 0.99075 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 2.25 / 0.99075.\n\nCompute denominator 0.99075.\n\nCompute 2.25 / 0.99075:\n\nLet me write it as (2.25 * 10000) / (9907.5) = 22500 / 9907.5 \u2248 Let's compute 22500 \u00f7 9907.5.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2.25:\n\n22500 / 2.25 = 10000\n\n9907.5 / 2.25 = 4403.333...\n\nSo now it's 10000 / 4403.333 \u2248 approximately 2.2707.\n\nSo about 2.27. But the options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.\n\nHmm, none is exactly 2.27. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps my approximation for 0.99768^4 is not accurate enough.\n\nLet me compute 0.99768^4 more accurately.\n\nCompute 0.99768^2:\n\n0.99768 * 0.99768:\n\nCompute as (1 - 0.00232)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2.\n\nWhich is 1 - 0.00464 + 0.0000053824 = 0.9953653824.\n\nNow, square that again to get the fourth power.\n\n(0.9953653824)^2.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n0.9953653824 * 0.9953653824.\n\nApproximate step by step:\n\nFirst, 0.995 * 0.995 = 0.990025.\n\nBut more accurately, let's compute:\n\n= (1 - 0.0046346176)^2\n\n= 1 - 2 * 0.0046346176 + (0.0046346176)^2\n\n= 1 - 0.0092692352 + 0.00002148.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.990751245.\n\nSo 0.99768^4 \u2248 0.990751245.\n\nSo 2.25 / 0.990751245 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.25 \u00f7 0.990751245.\n\nCompute 2.25 / 0.990751245 = approximately 2.271.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 2.27. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the velocities are not affecting the calculation of luminosity because the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so the luminosity is computed based on their intrinsic properties, regardless of their velocities. So perhaps the radial velocities are not relevant here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So they probably used the observed wavelength maximum to find the temperature, but because of Doppler shift, the intrinsic temperature would be different.\n\nWait, let me think again. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is v/c. For Star_1, v=0, so lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.\n\nFor Star_2, v=700 km/s, which is positive (if moving away), so lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is 700/(3e5) \u2248 0.002333.\n\nSo the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So:\n\nlambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )\n\nSo lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )\n\nBut lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T, so:\n\nlambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 = T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )\n\nSo T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )\n\nCompute sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) = sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) )\n\nWhich is approximately sqrt(0.99537) \u2248 0.99768 as before.\n\nSo T2 = T1 * 0.99768.\n\nNow, compute L1 and L2.\n\nL1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4\n\nL2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4\n\nSo L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )\n\nR1 = 1.5 R2 \u2192 R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.\n\nT1 = T2 / 0.99768 \u2192 T1^4 = (T2^4) / (0.99768)^4.\n\nSo,\n\nL1/L2 = (2.25) * (1/(0.99768^4 )) )\n\nWe calculated 0.99768^4 \u2248 0.99075.\n\nSo L1/L2 \u2248 2.25 / 0.99075 \u2248 2.271.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is B) ~2.32, but that's a bit higher. Wait, perhaps my approximation is too rough. Let me compute 2.25 / 0.99075 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 2.25 \u00f7 0.99075.\n\nCompute 0.99075 \u00d7 2.27 = ?\n\n0.99075 * 2 = 1.9815.\n\n0.99075 * 0.27 = 0.2675.\n\nTotal is 1.9815 + 0.2675 = 2.249.\n\nAh! So 0.99075 * 2.27 \u2248 2.249, which is very close to 2.25.\n\nSo 2.27 is the approximate ratio.\n\nBut the options don't have 2.27. The options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different result.\n\nWait, let me compute 0.99768^4 more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator for 0.99768^4.\n\n0.99768^2 = (0.99768)*(0.99768).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.99768 * 0.99768.\n\n= (1 - 0.00232)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2.\n\n= 1 - 0.00464 + 0.0000053824.\n\n= 0.9953653824.\n\nNow, square that again: (0.9953653824)^2.\n\nCompute 0.9953653824 * 0.9953653824.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n0.995 * 0.995 = 0.990025.\n\nBut more accurately:\n\nLet me compute 0.9953653824 \u00d7 0.9953653824.\n\nLet me think of it as (0.995 + 0.0003653824) squared.\n\n= (0.995)^2 + 2 * 0.995 * 0.0003653824 + (0.0003653824)^2.\n\n= 0.990025 + 2*(0.995)*(0.0003653824) + (approx 0.000000133).\n\nCompute 2*(0.995)*(0.0003653824) = 2 * 0.995 * 0.0003653824 \u2248 0.000726324.\n\nSo total is approximately 0.990025 + 0.000726324 = 0.990751324.\n\nPlus 0.000000133 is negligible.\n\nSo 0.9953653824^2 \u2248 0.990751324.\n\nSo 0.99768^4 = 0.990751324.\n\nSo 2.25 / 0.990751324 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.25 \u00f7 0.990751324.\n\nLet me do this division.\n\nLet me compute 2.25 / 0.990751324 \u2248 Let's see:\n\nApproximate denominator as 0.990751324 \u2248 0.99075.\n\nWe can write 2.25 \u00f7 0.99075 = ?\n\nLet me compute 2.25 / 0.99075.\n\nWe can write it as (2.25 * 100000) / (99075.1324) \u2248 225000 / 99075.1324 \u2248 Let me compute 225000 \u00f7 99075.1324.\n\nApproximately:\n\n99075.1324 * 2.27 = 99075.1324 * 2 = 198150.2648.\n\n99075.1324 * 0.27 = 99075.1324 * 0.2 = 19815.02648.\n\n99075.1324 * 0.07 = 6935.259268.\n\nSo 19815.02648 + 6935.259268 = 26750.28575.\n\nTotal 198150.2648 + 26750.28575 = 224,900.5505.\n\nWhich is very close to 225,000. So 2.27 gives 224,900.55, which is just 99.45 less than 225,000.\n\nSo the difference is about 99.45, which is 225000 - 224900.55 = 99.45.\n\nSo the ratio is 2.27 + (99.45 / 99075.1324) \u2248 2.27 + 0.001004 \u2248 2.271.\n\nSo approximately 2.271.\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest is option B) ~2.32, but that's not close. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the velocities are not affecting the calculation of luminosity because the problem states that the luminosity is computed as if the stars are black bodies, and the observed wavelength is used to find the temperature. So perhaps the Doppler shift is already accounted for in the temperature calculation.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you observe a star, the wavelength is Doppler shifted. So when you measure the peak wavelength, you can compute the temperature using Wien's law, but the temperature you get is the observed temperature, which is different from the intrinsic.\n\nWait, no. Because the peak wavelength observed is due to the Doppler shift of the intrinsic emission. So if the star's rest frame has a temperature T, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to T by lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), assuming v is positive when moving away.\n\nWait, no. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the recession velocity (positive when moving away). So if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the computed temperature would be lower.\n\nBut in this problem, the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_1, which has v=0, lambda_rest1 = lambda_obs1.\n\nFor Star_2, which has v=700 km/s, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ) \u2248 sqrt(1.002333/0.997667) \u2248 sqrt(1.00468) \u2248 1.00233.\n\nSo lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * 1.00233.\n\nBut the problem states that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.\n\nSo,\n\nlambda_rest1 = lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * 1.00233.\n\nSince lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T, this implies:\n\nlambda_rest1 = 1.00233 * lambda_rest2 \u2192 T1 = T2 / 1.00233 \u2248 T2 * 0.99768.\n\nWait, this is the same as before. So T2 = T1 * 1.00233.\n\nWait, no, because lambda_rest is inversely proportional to T. So if lambda_rest1 = 1.00233 * lambda_rest2, then T1 = T2 / 1.00233.\n\nSo T2 = T1 * 1.00233.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I had earlier. Oh wait, because if lambda_rest increases, T decreases.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nlambda_rest \u221d 1/T \u2192 T = 1/(lambda_rest) * constant.\n\nSo if lambda_rest1 = 1.00233 * lambda_rest2 \u2192 lambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 = 1.00233 \u2192 T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.00233 \u2192 T1 = T2 / 1.00233 \u2192 T2 = T1 * 1.00233.\n\nSo, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of approximately 1.00233.\n\nSo then, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is:\n\nL1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )\n\nWe have R1 = 1.5 R2 \u2192 R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.\n\nT2 = T1 * 1.00233 \u2192 T2^4 = T1^4 * (1.00233)^4.\n\nSo,\n\nL1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4) / ( T1^4 * (1.00233)^4 )\n\n= 2.25 / (1.00233)^4.\n\nCompute (1.00233)^4.\n\nAgain, since 1.00233 is close to 1, we can approximate using (1 + x)^n \u2248 1 + nx for small x.\n\nx = 0.00233.\n\nSo (1.00233)^4 \u2248 1 + 4 * 0.00233 = 1 + 0.00932 = 1.00932.\n\nSo,\n\nL1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00932 \u2248 2.229.\n\nAh, so approximately 2.23.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is ~2.23.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought that T2 was lower than T1, but that was incorrect because I had the Doppler shift direction wrong. Now, with the correct approach, L1/L2 is approximately 2.23, which matches option D.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D) ~2.23.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:\n\n\\[\nL = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\n\\]\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Radius Ratio**: \\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \\), so \\( R_1^2 = 2.25 R_2^2 \\).\n2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} \\)).\n3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has \\( v_1 = 0 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), and Star_2 has \\( v_2 = 700 \\, \\text{km/s} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Relating Observed and Intrinsic Wavelengths\nThe observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is related to its intrinsic wavelength by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} \\) and \\( v_1 = 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{rest,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\propto 1/T \\), this implies:\n\n\\[\nT_2 = T_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Temperature Ratio\nFor \\( v_2 = 700 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), \\( v_2/c \\approx 0.00233 \\). Substituting into the Doppler formula:\n\n\\[\nT_2 = T_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + 0.00233}{1 - 0.00233}} \\approx T_1 \\sqrt{1.00466} \\approx T_1 \\cdot 1.00233\n\\]\n\nThus, the temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\nT_2 \\approx 1.00233 \\, T_1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio\nThe luminosity ratio is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \\) and \\( T_2 = 1.00233 \\, T_1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.00233)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1.00233)^4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Approximating \\( (1.00233)^4 \\)\nUsing the approximation \\( (1 + x)^n \\approx 1 + nx \\) for small \\( x \\), where \\( x = 0.00233 \\):\n\n\\[\n(1.00233)^4 \\approx 1 + 4(0.00233) = 1.00932\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00932} \\approx 2.229\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Matching with Options\nThe closest option to \\( 2.229 \\) is:\n\n**D) ~2.23**\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
