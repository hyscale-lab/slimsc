      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. \n\nSo the star has certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. Wait, but I think the spots are cooler regions, right? So when the spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the photosphere goes down. \n\nThe main question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes\u2014so when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.\n\nWait, the ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when there are spots, n1/n2 is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots, which should be greater than 1.\n\nIn LTE, the number of atoms in two energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights. So the ratio is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) if E2 > E1, because E2 - E1 would be positive. Or wait, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ), where \u0394E = E2 - E1. So if \u0394E is positive (E2 higher than E1), then the ratio depends on exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ). \n\nWait, let me get this right. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So if E1 is lower than E2, then E1-E2 is negative, making the exponent positive. So as temperature increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases if E1 < E2. Because exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) would be a positive number greater than 1 if E2 > E1 and T is positive. \n\nSo when the star's temperature decreases (because of spots), what happens to the ratio? Let's say when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the exponent becomes smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease if the energy of level 2 is higher than level 1.\n\nWait, in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when Teff goes down, n1/n2 goes down. That suggests that as T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because when T decreases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases, which would make the ratio n1/n2 larger. But wait, no, wait. Because when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so the exponent is larger, so exp of a larger positive number is larger. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) if E2 > E1. So higher T would make this ratio smaller because the exponent is smaller. So when T decreases, the ratio increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the ratio reversed. Let me double-check. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -\u0394E/(kT) ). So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases. So n1/n2 is the inverse, so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( \u0394E/(k T) ). So as T decreases, \u0394E/(kT) increases, so exp increases. So n1/n2 increases when T decreases. But the problem says when the star has spots (T=5500K), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I got the ratio wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the observed ratio is n2/n1. Let me read the question again. The question says, \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\". So n1 is the number in level 1, n2 in level 2. So the ratio is n1/n2.\n\nWhen the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making exp(...) larger, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. So either my understanding is wrong, or perhaps the transition is from a higher to lower energy level.\n\nWait, perhaps the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. Hmm, 1448 Angstroms is in the infrared. So perhaps the transition is a lower energy transition, meaning that E2 is lower than E1? Because higher energy transitions are at shorter wavelengths. Wait, the energy of a photon is E = hc/lambda. So longer lambda means lower energy. So a transition from E1 to E2 (E1 > E2) would emit a photon of energy E1 - E2. So if the transition is at 1448 \u00c5, which is about 0.1448 nm, that's in the infrared, so the energy is lower. So E1 - E2 = hc/(lambda), which would be a lower energy than, say, UV or visible transitions. So E1 is higher than E2. So E1 - E2 is positive, so E2 is lower than E1.\n\nWait, so in the Boltzmann equation, E2 is lower than E1. So E1 is the higher energy level. So in the ratio n1/n2, E1 is higher than E2. So n1 is the number in the higher energy level, n2 in the lower. So when T increases, what happens to n1/n2? Because the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T). Since E2 < E1, E2-E1 is negative, so the exponent is negative. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( negative value ). So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so the exp becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases with T.\n\nWait, no, let's compute it numerically. Let's say E1 = E2 + delta E, so delta E is positive. So E2 - E1 = - delta E. So the exponent is (-delta E)/(k T). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -delta E/(k T) ). So when T increases, delta E/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so exp is larger. So n1/n2 increases with T. So when T is higher (6000K), n1/n2 is larger. When T is lower (5500K), n1/n2 is smaller. Which matches the problem statement: when the star has spots (T=5500K), the ratio n1/n2 decreases.\n\nSo the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.\n\nWe can model this ratio as ( (g1/g2) exp( -delta E/(k T_no) ) ) / ( (g1/g2) exp( -delta E/(k T_yes) ) ) ) = exp( [delta E/(k) ] [ 1/T_yes - 1/T_no ] )\n\nWait, because when you divide, the (g1/g2) terms cancel. So the factor is exp( delta E/(k) (1/T_yes - 1/T_no) ) )\n\nWait, no, because delta E is E1 - E2. So in the exponent, we have (E2 - E1)/(k T) = - delta E/(k T). So the ratio becomes:\n\nexp( (E2-E1)/(k T_no) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_yes) ) )\n\nWhich is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_no - 1/T_yes) ) )\n\nWait, no, because the denominator is (E2-E1)/(k T_yes). So when you take the ratio, it's [ (E2-E1)/(k T_no) ) ] minus [ (E2-E1)/(k T_yes) ) ] inside the exponent. So it's (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_no) - 1/(T_yes) ) ]\n\nBut E2-E1 is negative because E1 > E2. So let me call delta E = E1 - E2, which is positive. So E2-E1 = -delta E.\n\nSo the exponent becomes [ (-delta E)/(k) ) ( 1/(T_no) - 1/(T_yes) ) ]\n\nWhich is [ (-delta E)/(k) ) * ( (T_yes - T_no) )/(T_no T_yes) ) ]\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe ratio factor is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = [ exp( -delta E/(k T_no) ) ] / [ exp( -delta E/(k T_yes) ) ]\n\nWhich is exp( [ -delta E/(k T_no) + delta E/(k T_yes) ] )\n\nFactor out delta E/(k):\n\nexp( (delta E/(k)) ( 1/T_yes - 1/T_no ) )\n\nSo delta E is E1-E2, which is positive.\n\nSo now, the question is, what is delta E? Well, delta E is the energy difference between the two levels, which corresponds to the photon emitted when transitioning from level 1 to 2. The wavelength is given as 1448 \u00c5. So delta E = hc / lambda.\n\nSo let's compute delta E.\n\nh is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.\n\nlambda is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters.\n\nSo delta E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) \n\nCalculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDenominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.\n\nSo delta E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.\n\nBut we can also express this in terms of eV because the Boltzmann constant is in eV/K units.\n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So delta E in eV is (1.372e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nWait, let me compute that again.\n\ndelta E (eV) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.602e-19 )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: since E = hc/(lambda), and in eV, hc is approximately 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5. So hc = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5.\n\nSo delta E = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5 / 1448 \u00c5 \u2248 12400 / 1448 \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nYes, that's much easier.\n\nSo delta E \u2248 8.56 eV.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponent:\n\n( delta E/(k) ) * (1/T_yes - 1/T_no )\n\nk is Boltzmann's constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo delta E/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) \u2248 8.56 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 99321 K.\n\nSo delta E/(k) \u2248 99,321 K.\n\nNow, T_yes is 5500 K, T_no is 6000 K.\n\nSo 1/T_yes = 1/5500 \u2248 1.818e-4 K^-1.\n\n1/T_no = 1/6000 \u2248 1.6667e-4 K^-1.\n\nSo 1/T_yes - 1/T_no = (1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 K^-1 \u2248 1.513e-5 K^-1.\n\nSo (delta E/k) * (1/T_yes - 1/T_no) = 99,321 K * 1.513e-5 K^-1 \u2248 99,321 * 1.513e-5 \u2248 let's calculate:\n\n99,321 * 1.513e-5 = \n\nLet me compute 99,321 * 1.513e-5:\n\nApproximate 99,321 as 1e5, 1e5 * 1.5e-5 = 1.5. But more accurately:\n\n99,321 * 1.513e-5 = (99,321) * (1.513) / 1e5.\n\nCompute 99,321 * 1.513 \u2248 99,321 * 1.5 = 148,981.5 and 99,321 * 0.013 = ~1291. So total approx 150,272.5.\n\nThen divide by 1e5: 150,272.5 / 1e5 \u2248 1.5027.\n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5027.\n\nSo the factor is exp(1.5027) \u2248 e^1.5 \u2248 4.48, since e^1.6 is about 4.953, e^1.5 is around 4.4817.\n\nWait, but let me compute e^1.5027 more accurately. 1.5027 is approximately 1.5.\n\ne^1.5 is approximately 4.4817.\n\nBut to get precise, perhaps use a calculator approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:\n\ne^1.5027 = e^(1.5 + 0.0027) = e^1.5 * e^0.0027.\n\ne^0.0027 \u2248 1 + 0.0027 + (0.0027)^2/2 \u2248 1.0027 + 0.0000036 \u2248 1.0027036.\n\nSo e^1.5027 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0027036 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.0027 \u2248 4.496.\n\nSo approximately 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is about 4.5.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5.\n\nWait, but wait. The exponent is (delta E/k)(1/T_yes - 1/T_no). Which we found to be approximately 1.5027. So exp(1.5027) is about 4.5.\n\nSo the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots \u2248 4.5.\n\nWhich corresponds to option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T}\\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta E = E_1 - E_2 \\) is the energy difference between the two levels, \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \\( T \\) is the effective temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{\\text{no spots}}}{\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\right)_{\\text{with spots}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{with spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spots}}}\\right)\\right).\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( \\Delta E \\)\nThe energy difference \\( \\Delta E \\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \\( \\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\). Using the relation \\( \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\), where \\( h \\) is Planck's constant and \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and converting to electron volts (eV) using \\( hc \\approx 12400 \\, \\text{eV\u00b7\u00c5} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{12400}{1448} \\approx 8.56 \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( \\Delta E / k \\)\nThe Boltzmann constant \\( k \\) is \\( 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K} \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{8.56}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 99321 \\, \\text{K}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the temperature term\nThe effective temperatures are \\( T_{\\text{no spots}} = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\) and \\( T_{\\text{with spots}} = 5500 \\, \\text{K} \\). The term \\( \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{with spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spots}}} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\approx 1.818 \\times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.513 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the exponent\nThe exponent is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{with spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spots}}}\\right) = 99321 \\times 1.513 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 1.5027.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compute the factor\nThe factor is:\n\n\\[\n\\exp(1.5027) \\approx 4.5.\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio \\( \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\) increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**C) ~4.5**",
