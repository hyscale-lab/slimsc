      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in a solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here.\n\nSo the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (\u03b2) for the complexes are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because \u03b24 is lower than \u03b23. Oh well, maybe the complexes have different structures or something.\n\nThe question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think blue refers to the [Co(SCN)_2] or maybe [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ with n=2. Wait, actually, I remember that the common blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^3- or maybe [Co(SCN)_6]^3-? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} because Co is +2. Let me think: each SCN- is -1. So for Co^2+, the number of SCN- would be n such that 2 - n = charge. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the complex would have a charge based on Co and the ligands. Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{m}, m would be 2 - n*(1) because each SCN- contributes -1. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think again: the complex charge would be Co's charge plus the sum of each ligand's charge. So Co^2+ plus n*(SCN^-), each SCN is -1. So the total charge is 2 + n*(-1) = 2 -n. So for a neutral complex, n=2. But wait, I think the complexes here are charged. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- would mean 4 SCN- and Co^2+ would give 2 +4*(-1) = -2. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, wait, perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^m, so m = 2 - n. Because each SCN- contributes -1. So if n is 4, then 2 -4 = -2. So [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2- for n=4. Because 2 (Co) plus 4*(-1) = -2. That makes sense. So [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is a common complex, I think.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"dithiocyanato\", which suggests two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because 2+ from Co and 2*(-1) from SCN- gives 0 charge. So that would be the neutral complex.\n\nBut the options are about the percentage of the blue complexes. I think the blue color is associated with [Co(SCN)_4]^3- or [Co(SCN)_6]^3-, but I'm not certain. Wait, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is the blue one. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would be the n=2 case. So the question is about the percentage of the n=2 complex.\n\nWait, the problem states \"dithiocyanato\" which implies two SCN- ligands, so n=2. So the species in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the stability constant \u03b22 is given as 40. But wait, the \u03b2 values are for each step. Let me think about how stability constants work.\n\nStability constants are for the formation of complexes stepwise. So \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, \u03b22 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b23 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and \u03b24 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.\n\nSo the overall \u03b2 for each complex is the product of the \u03b2's up to that step. For example, the overall \u03b2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22. Because the first step forms [CoSCN]^+, and the second step adds another SCN- to make [Co(SCN)_2]^0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the \u03b2 for each step is the formation of each additional ligand. So the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n} is the product of the stepwise \u03b2s up to n. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall \u03b2 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22. For [Co(SCN)_3]^- , it would be \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23, and so on.\n\nSo the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (the dithiocyanato complex) among all cobalt species. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co in this form relative to all possible forms (n=0,1,2,3,4).\n\nThe approach would be to calculate the fraction of each complex, sum them up, and then find the percentage for the n=2 complex.\n\nThe general formula for the fraction of a complex is given by the product of the stability constants up to that n, multiplied by the concentration of SCN- raised to the n, divided by the sum of all such terms for n from 0 to 4.\n\nWait, more accurately, the fraction f_n for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n} = (\u03b2_1 \u03b2_2 ... \u03b2_n) [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nBut since the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all possible complexes, including the free Co^2+ and all complexes, the fraction f_n is (\u03b2_1 \u03b2_2 ... \u03b2_n [SCN]^n) / (sum over all m of (\u03b2_1 \u03b2_2 ... \u03b2_m [SCN]^m) + 1) )\n\nWait, but another approach is to consider that the distribution depends on the formation of each complex step by step. The distribution can be calculated using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the problem using the equilibrium expressions. Let me think: the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.\n\nEach complex is formed stepwise, so [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n} = \u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.\n\nSo, the fractions can be determined by the relative amounts of each complex.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nFor each n (0 to 4), the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n} is given by (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n) [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.\n\nWait, but for n=0, it's just [Co^2+], which is the free ion. So for n=0, the product is 1 (since there are no \u03b2 terms), so [Co^2+] = [Co^2+] * 1.\n\nBut when considering the total, the sum is:\n\nTotal cobalt = [Co^2+] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nWait, no. Because each complex's concentration is [Co(SCN)_n] = \u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.\n\nSo the total concentration is:\n\nc_total = [Co^2+] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nBut wait, actually, the sum is over all possible complexes. So the denominator would be the sum of the terms for each n.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the fractions. The fraction f_n for each complex is (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [SCN]^n) / (sum over m=0 to 4 of (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2m [SCN]^m) )\n\nSo for each n, f_n = (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [SCN]^n) / (sum_m=0^4 (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2m [SCN]^m) )\n\nWait, but when m=0, the term is 1 (since \u03b2 terms are 1 and [SCN]^0 is 1). For m=1, it's \u03b21 [SCN], for m=2, \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN]^2, etc.\n\nSo for each n, the fraction is (\u03b21*\u03b22*...*\u03b2n * [SCN]^n) divided by the sum for m=0 to m=4 of (\u03b21*...*\u03b2m [SCN]^m).\n\nSo, in this problem, we have \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nWait, wait, but \u03b24 is 16, which is less than \u03b23. That might lead to a lower contribution from the higher complexes. Interesting.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nFirst, compute the term for each n.\n\nn=0: term0 = 1 (since product of zero \u03b2s is 1, [SCN]^0=1)\n\nn=1: term1 = \u03b21 [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nn=2: term2 = \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01 = 3.6\n\nn=3: term3 = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 * 0.001=22.68\n\nn=4: term4 = \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4. Let me compute this step by step.\n\n9*40=360.\n\n360 *63=22680.\n\n22680 *16=362880.\n\n(0.1)^4=0.0001.\n\nSo term4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nWait, that's 36.288.\n\nNow, let me sum all the terms:\n\nterm0=1\n\nterm1=0.9\n\nterm2=3.6\n\nterm3=22.68\n\nterm4=36.288\n\nSum = 1 + 0.9 =1.9; 1.9 +3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18 +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 64.468.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 is term2 / sum = 3.6 / 64.468.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3.6 /64.468 \u2248 0.05556.\n\nWait, 3.6 /64 is approximately 0.05625.\n\nWait, 64 *0.05625 is 3.6.\n\nSo 3.6 /64.468 is approximately 0.05556, which is about 5.556%.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem states that the solution has thiocyanate, and the blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But according to the calculation, the fraction is about 5.5%, which is not among the options given (options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%).\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of the terms. Let me double-check.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN-] = 0.1 M.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nterm0 =1.\n\nterm1=\u03b21 [SCN] =9 *0.1 =0.9.\n\nterm2=\u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN]^2 =9*40 * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6.\n\nterm3=\u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN]^3 =9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n9*40=360.\n\n360 *63 = 22680.\n\n(0.1)^3=0.001.\n\n22680 *0.001=22.68.\n\nterm3=22.68.\n\nterm4=\u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.\n\nCompute 9*40=360.\n\n360 *63=22680.\n\n22680 *16=362880.\n\n(0.1)^4=0.0001.\n\n362880 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nSo the terms are:\n\nterm0=1 \u2192 1.\n\nterm1=0.9 \u2192 0.9.\n\nterm2=3.6 \u21923.6.\n\nterm3=22.68 \u219222.68.\n\nterm4=36.288 \u219236.288.\n\nSum is 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo the sum is 64.468.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 \u2248 0.05556 \u2192 ~5.56%.\n\nBut the options are much higher. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the stability constants. Maybe \u03b24 is for the fifth complex, but wait no, the problem says four stability constants: \u03b21 to \u03b24, so four steps, n=1 to n=4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which is n=4. So the question is about the percentage of n=4.\n\nWait, that would change things. Let me see.\n\nSo if the question is about [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is n=4, then the fraction is term4 / sum.\n\nterm4 is 36.288.\n\n36.288 /64.468 \u22480.5625 \u219256.25%. But that's not among the options either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is about [Co(SCN)_2]^{3-}, but that would require a different charge. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to the tetrathiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"dithiocyanato\" which usually refers to two SCN groups. So n=2. But according to the calculation, the percentage is ~5.5%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot that the total concentration includes all complexes, but perhaps the calculation should include [Co^2+] as well. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach is to compute the distribution of each complex.\n\nThe fraction of each complex is (\u03b21\u03b22...\u03b2n [SCN]^n) / (sum over m=0 to 4 of (\u03b21\u03b22...\u03b2m [SCN]^m) )\n\nSo for each n, the fraction is termn / sum.\n\nWe have:\n\nsum = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 64.468.\n\nSo the fractions are:\n\nn=0: 1/64.468 \u22480.01551 \u21921.551%\n\nn=1:0.9/64.468\u22480.014 \u21921.4%\n\nn=2:3.6/64.468\u22480.05556 \u21925.556%\n\nn=3:22.68/64.468\u22480.3518 \u219235.18%\n\nn=4:36.288/64.468\u22480.5625 \u219256.25%\n\nWait, so the sum of all fractions is 100%, which makes sense.\n\nBut the options don't include 5.5%, so I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is n=3 or n=4.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex, which would be n=4 with a negative charge. But according to the \u03b2 values, the \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23. So the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex may not be the most stable. But according to the fractions, the n=4 is 56% which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex as the blue one. Then the fraction would be 35.18%, which also isn't an option.\n\nWait, the options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the terms. Let me recompute each term:\n\nn=0: term0 = 1.\n\nn=1: term1 = \u03b21 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1 =0.9.\n\nn=2: term2= \u03b21 * \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2.\n\nSo 9*40=360. 0.1^2=0.01. 360 *0.01=3.6. Correct.\n\nn=3: term3= \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.\n\n9*40=360. 360 *63=22680. [SCN]^3=0.001. So 22680 *0.001=22.68. Correct.\n\nn=4: term4= \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24 * [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.\n\nCompute 9*40=360.\n\n360*63=22680.\n\n22680 *16=362880.\n\n[SCN]^4=0.0001.\n\n362880 *0.0001=36.288. Correct.\n\nSo the sum is 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.\n\nSo the fractions are as calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which could include n=2 and n=3, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stability constants are cumulative, not stepwise. Oh, wait! Maybe I misunderstood the stability constants. Let me think. No, the stability constants are given as \u03b21, \u03b22, etc., which are stepwise. So each \u03b2n is the constant for adding the nth ligand.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which is n=1. But the question says dithiocyanato, which is two, so n=2.\n\nHmm. Let me think again about the possible complexes and their colors. I'm a bit rusty, but I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is the intense blue color, while [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is pink, and [Co(SCN)_3]^- is green. So if the question is about the blue complex, that's n=4. But according to our calculation, the fraction for n=4 is ~56%, which is not an option. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the \u03b24 value. Let me re-read the problem statement. The problem says \u03b24=16. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different order. Maybe \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^3- and so on. No, the way the question presents them is \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So that's for n=1,2,3,4.\n\nWait, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which is n=1, but that's not dithiocyanato, that's mono? No, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands, so n=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the way I'm calculating the fractions is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, considering that the solution has multiple possible complexes, but perhaps I'm missing a step in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} complexes have varying stability, but perhaps the calculation should account for the possible dissociation steps. But I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the overall formation constant K for each complex, not the stepwise \u03b2. Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are \u03b21, \u03b22, etc., which are stepwise. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the percentage for n=2 is ~5.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_4]^3-, which would be n=4. But then the fraction is 56.25%, which is not an option. So I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the terms more precisely.\n\nLet me compute the sum again:\n\nterm0: 1.\n\nterm1: 0.9.\n\nterm2: 3.6.\n\nterm3: 22.68.\n\nterm4:36.288.\n\nSum: 1 +0.9=1.9 \u2192 +3.6=5.5 \u2192+22.68=28.18 \u2192+36.288=64.468.\n\nSo the sum is 64.468.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 \u2248 0.05556 \u21925.556%.\n\nBut the options are higher. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to consider the charge or the activity coefficients, but that's unlikely in this context.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all species that have exactly two SCN- ligands, which is the dithiocyanato complex. But according to the calculation, that's 5.5%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the \u03b2 values. Let me check: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nWait, perhaps the \u03b24 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, but that would be the product of \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24. So that's correct as I used it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M, but in the fraction calculation, it cancels out because it's the same for all species. So the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to all complexes except the free ion. But that would change the sum, but let's see.\n\nIf I exclude the free ion (n=0), the sum would be 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =63.468.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 would be 3.6 /63.468 \u2248 0.0566 \u21925.66%. Still not matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of all complexes including the free ion, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think again about the formula for the fractions.\n\nThe fraction of each complex is (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [SCN]^n) / (sum of all terms from m=0 to 4 of (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2m [SCN]^m) )\n\nYes, that's correct. So the calculation is accurate.\n\nSo the only possibility is that the correct answer isn't among the options, which can't be the case. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise. That would change everything. Let me think.\n\nIf the \u03b2 values are overall stability constants for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, then:\n\n\u03b21 is for [CoSCN]^+, \u03b22 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.\n\nWait, but the way the question presents them as \u03b21, \u03b22, etc., suggests they are stepwise. So I think that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of each complex and then find the fraction.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M.\n\nBut the sum of all complexes and the free Co^2+ should equal 0.01 M.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the approach I took earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the fraction using the following formula:\n\nThe fraction of [Co(SCN)_n] is (\u03b21\u03b22...\u03b2n [SCN]^n) / (1 + \u03b21[SCN] + \u03b21\u03b22[SCN]^2 + \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23[SCN]^3 + \u03b21\u03b22\u03b23\u03b24[SCN]^4 )\n\nWhich is the same as what I did earlier.\n\nSo I think the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't matching the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about which complex is blue.\n\nWait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- which is n=3. Then the fraction would be 22.68 /64.468 \u2248 0.3518 \u219235.18%, which is not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex, which would be n=4, but that's 36.288 /64.468=0.5625 \u219256.25%, which is also not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which is n=1. So the fraction is 0.9 /64.468 \u22481.4%, which is even smaller.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. The calculation suggests that the percentage for the dithiocyanato (n=2) is about 5.5%, but the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the terms more accurately.\n\nLet me compute each term with more precision.\n\nterm0 =1.\n\nterm1= \u03b21 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.\n\nterm2=9 *40 *0.1^2=360 *0.01=3.6.\n\nterm3=9*40*63 *0.1^3.\n\n9 *40=360.\n\n360 *63=22680.\n\n0.1^3=0.001.\n\n22680 *0.001=22.68.\n\nterm3=22.68.\n\nterm4=9 *40 *63 *16 *0.1^4.\n\n9*40=360.\n\n360 *63=22680.\n\n22680 *16=362880.\n\n0.1^4=0.0001.\n\n362880 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nSo the sum is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given in a different order. Suppose that \u03b21 is for the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex, but that would make the stepwise constants in a different order, which would change the calculation. But the question says \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2\u2212n} as \u03b2n, but in reverse order. But that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the overall \u03b2 for each complex, not the stepwise. Let me think: for example, the overall \u03b2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be \u03b21*\u03b22 =9*40=360.\n\nBut then, for [Co(SCN)_3]^- it's \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23=9*40*63=22680.\n\nFor [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, it's \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24=9*40*63*16=362880.\n\nSo the terms would be:\n\nn=0:1.\n\nn=1: \u03b21 [SCN]=9 *0.1=0.9.\n\nn=2: \u03b21\u03b22 [SCN]^2=360 *0.01=3.6.\n\nn=3:22680 *0.001=22.68.\n\nn=4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So the sum is the same.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The calculation says the fraction for n=2 is ~5.5%, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_4]^3- and thus n=4. But according to the calculation, that's 56.25%, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{3-}, which would be n=5, but the problem only gives \u03b21 to \u03b24, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering only up to a certain n. For example, perhaps the problem is considering only up to n=3.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the sum without n=4.\n\nSo sum would be 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 =28.18.\n\nThen the fraction for n=2 would be 3.6/28.18 \u22480.1277 \u219212.77%.\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_3]^- which is 22.68/64.468\u224835.18%. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup and the \u03b2 values are actually the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. Let me think about that.\n\nIf \u03b21 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, \u03b22 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.\n\nWait, no, that's not the case because the stepwise \u03b2s are used in the product for higher complexes.\n\nHmm. I'm not sure where the mistake is. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2, but I've made a calculation error.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate each term again with more precision.\n\nn=0: 1.\n\nn=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nn=2: 9 *40 *0.01 = 3.6.\n\nn=3:9 *40 *63 *0.001 =22.68.\n\nn=4:9 *40 *63 *16 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nSum=64.468.\n\nSo the fractions are:\n\nn=2:3.6 /64.468 =0.05556 \u21925.556%.\n\nBut none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the first two complexes (n=1 and n=2).\n\nn=1:0.9, n=2:3.6 \u2192 sum 4.5.\n\n4.5/64.468 \u22480.0698 \u21926.98%. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all complexes except the free ion. Then the sum would be 63.468.\n\nn=2 is 3.6/63.468=0.0566 \u21925.66%. Still no.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach or consider that the answer is option D)16.9%, but I don't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check.\n\nWait, [SCN] is 0.1 M. So [SCN]^2 is 0.01, correct.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the logarithm of the stability constants, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the fraction using the following formula:\n\nThe fraction for each complex is (\u03b21\u03b22...\u03b2n [SCN]^n) / (sum for m=0 to 4 of (\u03b21\u03b22...\u03b2m [SCN]^m) )\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{3-}, which would require n=5, but that's beyond the given \u03b2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different order for the \u03b2s. For example, perhaps \u03b21 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b22 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- etc. But that would change the terms.\n\nWait, if \u03b21=9 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, \u03b22=40 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- etc., then the terms would be:\n\nn=0:1.\n\nn=1: [CoSCN]^+ \u2192 \u03b21=9.\n\nn=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 \u2192\u03b21=9.\n\nn=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- \u2192\u03b21*\u03b22=9*40=360.\n\nn=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- \u21929*40*63=22680.\n\nBut that's not how the \u03b2s are given. The \u03b2s are stepwise, so each \u03b2n is the step to add the nth ligand.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck and perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the stability constant. No, that would make the fractions even smaller.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes in the solution, but considering that each complex has multiple ions. But I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the fractions using the given options. Let's see.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)42.3%\n\nB)25.6%\n\nC)38.1%\n\nD)16.9%\n\nWhich of these could be close to any of the fractions I've calculated?\n\nThe fractions I've calculated are:\n\nn=0: ~1.55%\n\nn=1: ~1.4%\n\nn=2:~5.55%\n\nn=3:~35.18%\n\nn=4:~56.25%\n\nNone of these match the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the \u03b2 values.\n\nWait, perhaps the \u03b2 values are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16, but perhaps \u03b24 is for the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex. So in that case, the overall \u03b2 for n=4 is \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24=9*40*63*16=362880.\n\nBut that's what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the \u03b24 is actually for the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex, making the overall \u03b23=\u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23=9*40*16=5760, and \u03b24=63 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- as 5760*63=362880.\n\nWait, no, the problem states \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the overall \u03b2 for each complex, not stepwise. Let me think: for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall \u03b2 is \u03b21*\u03b22=360. Then, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 =360 * [Co^2+][SCN]^2.\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nI'm stuck. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate the terms again.\n\nWait, let me compute the sum again:\n\nterm0=1.\n\nterm1=0.9.\n\nterm2=3.6.\n\nterm3=22.68.\n\nterm4=36.288.\n\nSum=1+0.9=1.9 \u2192+3.6=5.5 \u2192+22.68=28.18 \u2192+36.288=64.468.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 \u22480.05556 \u21925.556%.\n\nBut the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ (n=1), which is 0.9/64.468\u22481.4%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of the first two complexes (n=1 and n=2), which would be 0.9+3.6=4.5. 4.5/64.468\u22486.98%.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, considering that each complex can dissociate into multiple ions, but I don't think that affects the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for [SCN-]. Wait, the problem states [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is not at equilibrium, but that's unlikely.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I should calculate the concentration of each complex and then find the percentage.\n\nThe total concentration of Co is 0.01 M.\n\nThe sum of all complexes and free Co^2+ equals 0.01 M.\n\nBut the approach I used earlier should account for that.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps the answer is option D)16.9%, but I don't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me compute each term again with more precise values.\n\nterm0=1.0000.\n\nterm1=9 * 0.1 =0.9000.\n\nterm2=9 *40 *0.01=3.6000.\n\nterm3=9 *40 *63 *0.001.\n\n9*40=360.\n\n360*63=22680.\n\n22680 *0.001=22.6800.\n\nterm4=9 *40 *63 *16 *0.0001.\n\n9*40=360.\n\n360*63=22680.\n\n22680 *16=362880.\n\n362880 *0.0001=36.2880.\n\nSum=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.\n\nSo the fractions are:\n\nn=0:1/64.468\u22480.01551 \u21921.551%.\n\nn=1:0.9/64.468\u22480.014 \u21921.4%.\n\nn=2:3.6/64.468\u22480.05556 \u21925.556%.\n\nn=3:22.68/64.468\u22480.3518 \u219235.18%.\n\nn=4:36.288/64.468\u22480.5625 \u219256.25%.\n\nSo the only way any of the options match is if I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex in terms of all possible complexes, including those with higher n. But that doesn't change the fraction.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex in the solution, considering that each complex contributes to the total cobalt concentration. But I think that's already accounted for in the calculation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to the total of all possible complexes except the free ion. So sum would be 63.468, and n=2 is 3.6/63.468\u22485.66%. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the logarithm of the fractions. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option D)16.9%.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recalculate using a different approach. Let me think about the fraction for n=2 again.\n\nAnother approach: using the formula for the fraction of each species.\n\nThe fraction f_n = (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 (\u03b21 \u03b22 ... \u03b2m [SCN]^m) )\n\nSo for n=2, f_2= (9 *40 *0.1^2) / (1 +9*0.1 +9*40*(0.1)^2 +9*40*63*(0.1)^3 +9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 )\n\nCalculating numerator: 9*40=360; 0.1^2=0.01 \u2192360*0.01=3.6.\n\nDenominator:1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.\n\nSo f_2=3.6/64.468=0.05556 \u21925.556%.\n\nBut the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the total concentration of Co and SCN in a different way. Let me think: perhaps the solution contains both Co^2+ and SCN- at the given concentrations, and the formation of complexes depends on their concentrations.\n\nBut that's already accounted for in the calculation.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case. Perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement once more.\n\nThe question states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all Co species is 0.01 M.\n\nThe stability constants are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nThe question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think that refers to [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is n=2.\n\nAccording to the calculation, that's about 5.5%, but the options don't include that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, including any possible higher complexes that have two SCN- ligands. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex as the blue one, which would be n=4. Then the fraction is 56.25%, which is not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D)16.9%, but I don't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me compute the sum again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the sum with more precise numbers.\n\nterm0=1.\n\nterm1=9 * 0.1 =0.9.\n\nterm2=9 *40 *0.01=3.6.\n\nterm3=9 *40 *63 *0.001=22.68.\n\nterm4=9 *40 *63 *16 *0.0001=36.288.\n\nSum=1 +0.9=1.9 \u2192+3.6=5.5 \u2192+22.68=28.18 \u2192+36.288=64.468.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468=0.05556 \u21925.556%.\n\nBut the options are much higher. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the stability constants. Let me think: if \u03b2 is small, the complex is less stable. But in this case, \u03b22=40 is larger than \u03b21=9, so the complexes are more stable.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal for some reason. Let me try.\n\nBut that would make the terms much smaller, which would make the fractions even smaller, which doesn't help.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation as it is, even though it doesn't match the options. But since the options don't include 5.5%, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the complexes as [Co(SCN)_n]^m where m is such that the charge is balanced. For example, [Co(SCN)_2]^+ would have charge 2+ -2*(1-) =0, but wait, that's not correct. Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- gives 2+ + 2*(-1) =0. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0.\n\nWait, but that's what I've been considering as n=2.\n\nHmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The calculation suggests the percentage is ~5.5%, but the options don't match. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't find it.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution. The solution contains Co\u00b2\u207a at a concentration of 10\u207b\u00b2 M and SCN\u207b at 0.1 M, with stability constants \u03b2\u2081 = 9, \u03b2\u2082 = 40, \u03b2\u2083 = 63, and \u03b2\u2084 = 16. The stability constants are stepwise, meaning \u03b2\u2081 corresponds to [CoSCN]\u207a, \u03b2\u2082 to [Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070, \u03b2\u2083 to [Co(SCN)\u2083]\u207b, and \u03b2\u2084 to [Co(SCN)\u2084]\u00b2\u207b.\n\nThe fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{\\beta_1 \\beta_2 \\dots \\beta_n [\\text{SCN}]^n}{\\sum_{m=0}^4 (\\beta_1 \\beta_2 \\dots \\beta_m [\\text{SCN}]^m)}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( [\\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\), and the terms for \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\) are computed as follows:\n\n- \\( n = 0 \\): \\( \\text{term}_0 = 1 \\)\n- \\( n = 1 \\): \\( \\text{term}_1 = \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}] = 9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \\)\n- \\( n = 2 \\): \\( \\text{term}_2 = \\beta_1 \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}]^2 = 9 \\cdot 40 \\cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6 \\)\n- \\( n = 3 \\): \\( \\text{term}_3 = \\beta_1 \\beta_2 \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}]^3 = 9 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 63 \\cdot (0.1)^3 = 22.68 \\)\n- \\( n = 4 \\): \\( \\text{term}_4 = \\beta_1 \\beta_2 \\beta_3 \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}]^4 = 9 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 63 \\cdot 16 \\cdot (0.1)^4 = 36.288 \\)\n\nThe sum of all terms is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468\n\\]\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070, \\( n = 2 \\)) is:\n\n\\[\nf_2 = \\frac{\\text{term}_2}{\\text{Sum}} = \\frac{3.6}{64.468} \\approx 0.05556 \\, \\text{or} \\, 5.556\\%\n\\]\n\nThis value does not match any of the provided options (A: 42.3%, B: 25.6%, C: 38.1%, D: 16.9%). Despite rechecking the calculations and considering alternative interpretations of the problem, the computed percentage remains approximately 5.56%, which is not listed among the options. Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given choices.\n\nANSWER: None of the options match the calculated value.",
