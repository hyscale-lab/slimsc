      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and its velocity. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Oh wait, gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), right? So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nThe problem says the speed v is 0.96c. Let me plug that into the gamma equation. So v\u00b2 is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c\u00b2. Then 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) would be 1 - 0.9216, which is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yeah, that's right.\n\nNext, I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus X. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making a total of 6 nucleons. The mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.\n\nWhat's the mass of Li-6? I think the atomic mass of Li is about 6.94 grams per mole. But wait, that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Oh wait, but for a nucleus, we just take the mass of the nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton plus neutrons.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is approximately equal to the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons. Let's think. A proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c\u00b2. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass m0 = 3*(938 + 939) MeV/c\u00b2. Wait, no, wait, each proton is 938, each neutron about 939. So 3*(938 + 939) would be 3*(1877) MeV, which is 5631 MeV, or 5.631 GeV. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because in reality, the binding energy is considered, but perhaps for this problem, we can take the rest mass as the sum of individual protons and neutrons.\n\nWait, another approach: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). One u is about 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2. So 6 * 931.5 MeV is 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. Wait, but that's an approximation because the actual mass might be a bit less due to the binding energy. But for this problem, maybe we can take m0 as approximately 5.589 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I should use the mass of the deuteron or something else, but I think that's not necessary. Let me proceed with m0 = 5.589 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nWait, another point: the problem says \"nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons.\" So that's Li-6, yeah. So the mass is approximately 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/something. But perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass. Wait, but without exact data, I'll proceed with 5.589 GeV/c\u00b2 as the rest mass.\n\nSo, E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2. Wait, gamma is about 3.5714, m0 is 5.589 GeV/c\u00b2. So E is 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3.5714 *5.589. Hmm, 3.57 *5.589. Let me compute:\n\n3 *5.589 is 16.767.\n0.57 *5.589 is approximately 3.188.\nSo total is approximately 16.767 + 3.188 = 19.955 GeV.\n\nWait, but wait, let me do it more accurately. 5.589 *3.5714.\n\nLet me compute 5.589 *3.5714:\n\nLet me write it as 5.589 * 3.5714.\n\n3.5714 is approximately 35714/10000.\n\n5.589 * 3.5714 = ?\n\nAlternatively, compute 5 *3.5714 = 17.857.\n0.589 *3.5714 \u2248 2.107.\n\nSo total is 17.857 +2.107 = 19.964 GeV.\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV. So my initial calculation gives about 19.96 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV. But the options don't have that exactly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption about the mass is wrong. Let me think again. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6 atomic mass units (u), but each u is 931.5 MeV/c\u00b2. So 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV =5.589 GeV. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider that the actual mass of Li-6 is a little less than 6u due to binding energy. Let me check. The binding energy for light nuclei isn't that significant, but perhaps for more accuracy, I should use the exact mass.\n\nWait, the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 5.586 u. Because, for example, the isotope with mass number 6, the exact mass is 5.586 u. So 5.586 *931.5 MeV = ?\n\nWait, 5.586 *931.5 = let's compute 5 *931.5 =4657.5, 0.586 *931.5=approx 545.7, so total is 4657.5 +545.7=5203.2 MeV, which is 5.2032 GeV.\n\nWait, that's a different number. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: perhaps the rest mass is taken as 5.586 GeV/c\u00b2. Let me use that.\n\nSo with gamma=3.5714, m0=5.586 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nE = 3.5714 *5.586.\n\nCompute 3.5714 *5.586:\n\nWell, 3 *5.586 =16.758.\n\n0.5714 *5.586: let's compute 0.5 *5.586=2.793, 0.0714 *5.586\u22480.400.\n\nSo 2.793+0.400=3.193.\n\nTotal E=16.758 +3.193=19.951 GeV.\n\nHmm, that's about 19.95 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have exactly 20 GeV.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma.\n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma. v=0.96c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 =0.9216.\n\n1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.\n\nsqrt(0.0784)=0.28.\n\nSo gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 0.28 is an approximation. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.\n\nWait, 0.0784 is 784e-4, which is 28^2 *1e-4, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...\n\nSo, gamma is exactly 3.57142857.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.\n\nWait, the atomic mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6.01512 u. Because, for example, looking up, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. So 6.01512 u.\n\nWait, wait, no. No, the atomic mass includes electrons. Wait, the problem is about the nucleus, so perhaps I should subtract the electrons' mass. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01512 u minus the mass of 3 electrons, because the nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and each Li atom has 3 electrons. So the nucleus mass is approximately 6.01512 u minus 3 * (electron mass).\n\nElectron mass is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.00164574 u.\n\nSo nucleus mass is 6.01512 - 0.00164574 = 6.013474 u.\n\nWait, but that's for the atom. No, wait, no. Wait, the atomic mass includes the nucleus and electrons. So to get the nucleus's mass, I should subtract the electrons' mass.\n\nWait, no. The atomic mass is the sum of the nucleus and electrons. So for Li-6, the atomic mass is about 6.01512 u. The nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons.\n\nEach electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.\n\nSo nucleus mass m0 = 6.01512 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.013474 u.\n\nNow, converting u to GeV/c\u00b2: 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c\u00b2 = 0.931494 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo m0 =6.013474 u * 0.931494 GeV/c\u00b2/u.\n\nCompute that: 6 * 0.931494 =5.588964 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\n0.013474 *0.931494 \u2248 0.01254 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo total m0 \u22485.588964 +0.01254 \u22485.6015 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo m0 is approximately 5.6015 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nNow, E = gamma * m0 c\u00b2. So gamma is 3.57142857.\n\nSo E =3.57142857 *5.6015 GeV.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3.57142857 *5.6015.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n3 *5.6015 =16.8045.\n\n0.57142857 *5.6015 = ?\n\n0.5 *5.6015 =2.80075.\n\n0.07142857 *5.6015 \u2248 0.400.\n\nSo 2.80075 + 0.400 \u22483.20075.\n\nSo total E \u224816.8045 +3.20075=20.00525 GeV.\n\nHmm, so approximately 20.005 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is way higher. Option A is 18.475, which is lower, and B is 23.069, which is even higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check.\n\nGamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28=3.57142857.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise numbers.\n\nWait, the exact value of gamma when v=0.96c is gamma= 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut then, with m0=5.6015 GeV/c\u00b2, E=3.57142857 *5.6015.\n\nLet me compute 3.57142857 *5.6015.\n\nLet me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.\n\n3.57142857 *0.6015 = ?\n\n0.6015 is 0.6 +0.0015.\n\n3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.\n\n3.57142857 *0.0015=0.0053571428.\n\nSo sum is 2.14285714 +0.0053571428=2.14821428.\n\nSo total E =17.85714285 +2.14821428 =20.0053571 GeV.\n\nSo about 20.005 GeV.\n\nBut the options don't have exactly that. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6.\n\nWait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.586 u. Let me check that. Wait, I think I might have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, another approach: the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01512 u minus the electrons. Wait, no, that's the atomic mass. The nucleus mass is 6.01512 u minus (3 * electron mass), which is 6.01512 - (3 *0.00054858) =6.01512 -0.00164574=6.013474 u.\n\nWait, but that's the mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units. So converting to GeV/c\u00b2, 6.013474 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?\n\nWait, 6.013474 *931.494 MeV.\n\nCompute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.\n\n0.013474 *931.494 \u2248 12.55 MeV.\n\nSo total is 5588.964 +12.55 =5601.514 MeV, which is 5.6015 GeV.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nSo why am I getting 20.005 GeV, but the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let's compute gamma more precisely. 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857142857.\n\nNow, 3.57142857 *5.6015 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3.57142857 *5.6015.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.\n\n3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.\n\n3.57142857 *0.0015=0.0053571428.\n\nSo sum is 17.85714285 +2.142857142 +0.0053571428 =20.005357 GeV.\n\nHmm, so it's about 20.005 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: the energy per nucleon? No, the question is about the nucleus, so it's the total energy.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the kinetic energy, but the question says \"energy of the nucleus,\" which usually refers to the total energy (relativistic), not just kinetic.\n\nWait, but let me check. The total energy is gamma m0 c\u00b2, and the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m0 c\u00b2.\n\nBut the question is about the energy of the nucleus, so it's the total energy. So our calculation is correct.\n\nBut the options are off. Let me see the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 18.475 GeV\n\nB)23.069 GeV\n\nC)20.132 GeV\n\nD)21.419 GeV.\n\nWait, option C is 20.132 GeV. So my calculation gives 20.005 GeV, but option C is 20.132. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me compute the mass again. Maybe I used the wrong isotope.\n\nWait, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has atomic number 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3+3=6, so Li-6. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6, including binding energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass) divided by something else. Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct way is to take the actual mass, which is less than the sum due to binding energy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the mass of a deuteron as a reference. No, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon as approximately 0.938 GeV/c\u00b2, and multiply by 6.\n\nSo m0 =6 *0.938=5.628 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nThen E=3.5714 *5.628=?\n\n3.5714 *5=17.857.\n\n3.5714 *0.628= let's compute:\n\n3 *0.628=1.884.\n\n0.5714 *0.628\u22480.5714 *0.6=0.34284, plus 0.5714 *0.028\u22480.016. Total\u22480.3588.\n\nSo 1.884 +0.3588=2.2428.\n\nSo total E=17.857+2.2428=20.1 GeV.\n\nAh, that gives about 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV.\n\nSo perhaps the problem expects us to take the mass of each nucleon as 0.938 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo with m0=6 *0.938=5.628 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nThen E=3.5714 *5.628.\n\nLet me compute this precisely.\n\n3.5714 *5.628.\n\nLet me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.\n\n3.5714 *0.628=?\n\n3.5714 *0.6=2.14284.\n\n3.5714 *0.028=0.100.\n\nSo total is 2.14284 +0.100=2.24284.\n\nSo E=17.857 +2.24284=20.09984 GeV, approximately 20.1 GeV.\n\nSo that's very close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV.\n\nHmm, but why did I get a slightly different value earlier? Because perhaps the exact mass of the nucleus is taken as 6 *0.938 GeV/c\u00b2, which is 5.628 GeV.\n\nSo with that, the energy is approximately 20.1 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/2, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 5.586 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo let's compute gamma * m0.\n\nGamma is 3.5714.\n\n3.5714 *5.586 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3 *5.586 =16.758.\n\n0.5714 *5.586 = ?\n\n0.5 *5.586=2.793.\n\n0.0714 *5.586\u22480.400.\n\nSo 2.793 +0.400=3.193.\n\nTotal E=16.758 +3.193=19.951 GeV.\n\nHmm, which is about 19.95 GeV. Not matching any option exactly.\n\nSo perhaps the intended approach is to take each nucleon's mass as 0.938 GeV, leading to m0=5.628 GeV, and E=3.5714 *5.628=20.1 GeV.\n\nSo option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.\n\nBut why is there a discrepancy? Because perhaps I'm using an approximate value for the mass.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.\n\nWait, let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.\n\nUpon checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.586 u.\n\nSo converting to GeV/c\u00b2: 5.586 u * 931.494 MeV/u = 5.586 * 0.931494 GeV =5.586 *0.931494.\n\nCalculating:\n\n5 *0.931494=4.65747.\n\n0.586 *0.931494= let's compute.\n\n0.5 *0.931494=0.465747.\n\n0.08 *0.931494=0.0745195.\n\n0.006 *0.931494=0.005588964.\n\nAdding: 0.465747 +0.0745195=0.5402665 +0.005588964=0.545855464.\n\nSo total m0=4.65747 +0.545855464=5.203325 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 5.586 u is about 5.586 *931 MeV = 5203 MeV, which is 5.203 GeV. So that's correct.\n\nWait, so m0=5.203 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nThen E=gamma *m0 =3.5714 *5.203.\n\nCompute 3 *5.203=15.609.\n\n0.5714 *5.203= ?\n\n0.5 *5.203=2.6015.\n\n0.0714 *5.203\u22480.3714.\n\nSo sum is 2.6015 +0.3714=2.9729.\n\nTotal E=15.609 +2.9729=18.5819 GeV.\n\nHmm, that's about 18.58 GeV. But that's option A, which is 18.475 GeV. Hmm, not matching exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 3.5714 *5.203.\n\nLet me compute 3.5714 *5.203.\n\n3 *5.203=15.609.\n\n0.5714 *5.203.\n\nLet me compute 5.203 *0.5 =2.6015.\n\n5.203 *0.0714= approximately 0.3714.\n\nSo total 2.6015 +0.3714=2.9729.\n\nTotal E=15.609 +2.9729=18.5819 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 18.58 GeV.\n\nBut option A is 18.475 GeV. Hmm, but that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 5.586 u, which is 5.586 *931.5 MeV/c\u00b2=5.586 *0.9315 GeV.\n\nWait, 5.586 *0.9315.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n5 *0.9315=4.6575.\n\n0.586 *0.9315.\n\n0.5 *0.9315=0.46575.\n\n0.08 *0.9315=0.07452.\n\n0.006 *0.9315=0.005589.\n\nAdding: 0.46575 +0.07452=0.54027 +0.005589=0.545859.\n\nSo m0=4.6575 +0.545859=5.203359 GeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo E=3.5714 *5.203359.\n\nCompute 3.5714 *5.203359.\n\nLet me compute it accurately.\n\n3 *5.203359=15.610077.\n\n0.5714 *5.203359.\n\n0.5 *5.203359=2.6016795.\n\n0.0714 *5.203359= approx 0.3714 (exact calculation: 5.203359 *0.0714=0.371463).\n\nSo sum is 2.6016795 +0.371463=2.9731425.\n\nTotal E=15.610077 +2.9731425=18.5832195 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 18.583 GeV, which is close to option A (18.475) but not exactly. So perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects us to use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons, ignoring binding energy.\n\nSo each proton is about 938 MeV, each neutron 939 MeV.\n\nSo for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(938 +939)=3*(1877)=5631 MeV=5.631 GeV.\n\nSo m0=5.631 GeV.\n\nE=3.5714 *5.631.\n\nCompute:\n\n3 *5.631=16.893.\n\n0.5714 *5.631.\n\n0.5 *5.631=2.8155.\n\n0.0714 *5.631\u22480.404.\n\nSo sum is 2.8155 +0.404=3.2195.\n\nTotal E=16.893 +3.2195=20.1125 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 20.11 GeV.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.\n\nSo perhaps the intended approach is to take the mass as the sum of individual protons and neutrons, giving m0=5.631 GeV.\n\nThen E=3.5714 *5.631=20.11 GeV, which is close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the energy of the nucleus X (Li-6) moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:\n\n\\[\nE = \\gamma m_0 c^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\) is the Lorentz factor, and \\( m_0 \\) is the rest mass of the nucleus.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( \\gamma \\)\nGiven \\( v = 0.96c \\), we compute:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the rest mass \\( m_0 \\)\nThe nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest mass of a proton (\\( 938 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\)) and neutron (\\( 939 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\)):\n\\[\nm_0 = 3 \\times (938 + 939) \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 = 3 \\times 1877 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 = 5631 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 = 5.631 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the total energy \\( E \\)\nSubstitute \\( \\gamma = 3.5714 \\) and \\( m_0 = 5.631 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2 \\) into the energy formula:\n\\[\nE = \\gamma m_0 = 3.5714 \\times 5.631 \\, \\text{GeV}\n\\]\n\nBreaking this calculation into parts:\n\\[\n3.5714 \\times 5.631 = 3.5714 \\times (5 + 0.631) = (3.5714 \\times 5) + (3.5714 \\times 0.631)\n\\]\n\\[\n3.5714 \\times 5 = 17.857, \\quad 3.5714 \\times 0.631 \\approx 2.253\n\\]\n\\[\nE \\approx 17.857 + 2.253 = 20.11 \\, \\text{GeV}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Match with the closest option\nThe calculated energy is approximately \\( 20.11 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), which is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight differences in the assumed rest mass.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
