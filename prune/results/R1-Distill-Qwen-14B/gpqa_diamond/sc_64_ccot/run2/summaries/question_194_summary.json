      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see what the question says.\n\nSo, the system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by considering all possible states and their energies.\n\nWait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). Each state contributes a term like e^(-\u03b2E). So first, I need to find all possible spin configurations and calculate E for each.\n\nEach spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because E depends on that sum.\n\nEach term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Wait, let me think. Each product S_i S_j is 1 if the two spins are the same, -1 otherwise. So for three pairs, the sum can range from 3 (all same) down to -3 (all opposite).\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. For three spins, each pair's product can be 1 or -1. So the sum can vary depending on how many pairs are aligned. \n\nWait, another approach: each spin configuration can be either all up, two up and one down, etc. Let's think about how many pairs are aligned.\n\nCase 1: All three spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all = -1. Let's compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each product is 1, so sum is 3. So E = -J *3.\n\nHow many such states? There are two: all +1 and all -1.\n\nCase 2: Two spins are up, one is down. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nHow many such states? For three spins, the number of ways to have two +1 and one -1 is 3 choose 1, which is 3. So three states each contributing E = J.\n\nWait, but wait: each of these states has the same sum. Let me check another configuration. Let's take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1)+1+(-1) = -1. So same sum. So yes, all three such states have sum = -1, so E = J*1.\n\nWait, no, wait. The energy is E = -J (sum). So if the sum is -1, then E = -J*(-1) = J*1 = J. So each of these three states contributes e^(-\u03b2 E) = e^(-\u03b2 J).\n\nCase 3: All spins are different. Wait, no, for three spins, it's impossible to have all different because each can be only +1 or -1. Wait, that's not possible. So another case is when all three are not the same, but maybe two are down and one up. Wait, but that's similar to case 2. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another case where the sum is +1. Let's see another configuration. Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. Hmm, same as before. So maybe I made a mistake in thinking the sum can be 3, -3, but perhaps the sum can also be +1 and -1, but perhaps not 3. Wait, no, when all spins are the same, the sum is 3, and when two are same and one different, sum is -1. Wait, but wait, maybe the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: For three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take which values?\n\nLet me think of each product as either 1 or -1.\n\nThe sum can be 3 (all 1s), 1 (two 1s and one -1), -1 (two -1s and one 1), or -3 (all -1s).\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me compute all possible sums.\n\nCase 1: All three same. Sum is 3. Number of states: 2.\n\nCase 2: Two same, one different. Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\nHow many such states? Well, the number of ways to choose which spin is different. There are 3 choices (S3, S2, or S1). So three states each with sum -1.\n\nCase 3: All three different. Wait, but that's impossible because each spin can be only +1 or -1. So for three spins, you can't have all three different. So the only possibilities are all same, two same and one different, or maybe another scenario.\n\nWait, no, wait. Another possibility is when all three products are -1. So sum is -3. How can that happen?\n\nWait, each product S_i S_j is -1. So for S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, and S2S3 = -1.\n\nHmm, let me see. Let me think about the spin configurations. For example, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1)+1 + (-1) = -1. Not -3.\n\nAnother configuration: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. Hmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe there's no way to get all three products to be -1. Because if S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, then S2 must equal S3. Because S1S2 = -1 implies S2 = -S1. S1S3 = -1 implies S3 = -S1. So S2 = S3. Then S2S3 = S2^2 = 1. So sum would be (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. So it's impossible to have all three products be -1. So the sum can't be -3. So the possible sums are 3, 1, and -1.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of sum 1, maybe that's possible. Let me think of a configuration where the sum is +1.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then the products are S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, but that gives sum -1. So maybe there's no configuration where the sum is +1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the possible values of the sum.\n\nEach term S_i S_j is either 1 or -1. So the sum can be 3 (all 1s), 1 (two 1s and one -1), or -1 (two -1s and one 1), or -3 (all -1s). But earlier, I thought that sum=-3 is impossible because it's not possible for all three products to be -1.\n\nWait, but maybe I was wrong. Let me try to find a configuration where all three products are -1.\n\nSuppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. So sum is -1, not -3.\n\nAlternatively, what if all three spins are the same: S1=S2=S3=+1. Then each product is 1, sum is 3.\n\nAnother configuration: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum 3.\n\nWhat about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nWait, so sum can't be +1? Or can it?\n\nWait, another configuration: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nThen S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe the sum can't be +1. So possible sums are 3, -1, and -3?\n\nWait, but how about when two products are -1 and one is +1. Let me think: sum would be (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.\n\nSo the possible sums are 3, -1, and perhaps another.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the sum can be 1 or -1, but not 3 or -3. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the possible number of +1s in the sum.\n\nEach term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1.\n\nLet me think of the sum as S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet me denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nI can think of this as H = (S1)(S2 + S3) + S2 S3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute H for all possible spin states.\n\nSo each spin can be +1 or -1, so 8 possible states. Let me list them all.\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\nH = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 +1 +1 = 3. So E = -J*3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\nH = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\nH = (1)(-1) + (1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\nH = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\nH = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\nH = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1. E=J.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\nH = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. E=J.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\nH = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 +1 +1 =3. E=-3J.\n\nWait, so looking at all 8 states, only two states have H=3 (E=-3J), and the other six have H=-1 (E= J).\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought some might have H=1. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?\n\nWait, let me recheck each case.\n\nCase 1: all +1: H=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nCase 2: S3=-1, others +1. So H=1*(-1) (since S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1), so H=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me redo all 8 cases.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute each H correctly.\n\n1. All +1: H=3 \u2192 E=-3J.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. E=J.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. So H= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. E=J.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. H= (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. E=J.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. H= (-1) + (-1) +1 =-1. E=J.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:\nS1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. H= (-1) +1 + (-1) =-1. E=J.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. H=1 + (-1) + (-1) =-1. E=J.\n\n8. All -1: H=3 \u2192 E=-3J.\n\nSo, from the 8 states, two have H=3 (so E=-3J), and six have H=-1 (so E= J).\n\nSo the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nEach state contributes a term exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo, for the two states with E=-3J: each contributes exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nFor the six states with E= J: each contributes e^{ -\u03b2 J}.\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^{3 J \u03b2} + 6 * e^{- J \u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 No, because exponents are opposite.\n\nOption B: Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2) \u2192 Yes! Because two states contribute e^{3J\u03b2}, six contribute e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nOption C: 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2) \u2192 No, exponents are 2J.\n\nOption D: 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2) \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\). The energy of the system is given by \\( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \\), and the partition function is defined as:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E},\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\beta = 1/(kT) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Enumerate all possible spin states\nThere are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) possible spin configurations for the three spins.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about three spins and their partition function. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.\n\nEach spin can be either +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z, which is the sum over all states of exp(-\u03b2E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT).\n\nWait, no, wait. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2 E}, right? So I need to compute E for each of the 8 possible states and then sum e^{-\u03b2 E} for each.\n\nBut calculating each state individually might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the possible values of the term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach S_i is either +1 or -1. Let me denote the product terms:\n\nS1S2 can be +1 or -1, same for S1S3 and S2S3. But adding them together can give different values.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider all possible combinations. Since each spin is \u00b11, the product of two spins is also \u00b11. Let me think about how the sum can vary.\n\nLet me think: for three spins, how does the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 look?\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as the sum of three terms, each of which is \u00b11. So the sum can be -3, -1, +1, +3.\n\nWait, let's see. Each term is either +1 or -1.\n\nSo the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Let me check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum of three \u00b11 terms can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nYes. For example:\n\nIf all products are +1: sum is 3.\n\nIf two are +1 and one is -1: sum is 2-1=1.\n\nIf one is +1 and two are -1: sum is 1-2= -1.\n\nIf all are -1: sum is -3.\n\nWait, no. Let's count. Each product is either 1 or -1. So for three products:\n\nNumber of +1s: 0,1,2,3.\n\nSum would be (number of +1s) - (number of -1s). Since each product is either +1 or -1, and there are three terms, the sum is (n+ - n-), where n+ +n- =3.\n\nSo sum = (n+) - (3 -n+) ) = 2n+ -3.\n\nSo possible sums:\n\nn+ =0: sum = -3\n\nn+ =1: sum = 2(1)-3 = -1\n\nn+ =2: sum =4-3=1\n\nn+ =3: sum=6-3=3\n\nSo the possible sums are -3, -1, 1, 3.\n\nSo each state's energy E is -J times this sum. So E = -J*(sum), which would be:\n\nsum =3 \u2192 E= -3J\n\nsum=1 \u2192 E= -J\n\nsum=-1 \u2192 E= J\n\nsum=-3 \u2192 E=3J\n\nWait, wait, because E = -J*(sum). So sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J * sum.\n\nSo for each state, E is -J multiplied by the sum of the products.\n\nSo for each possible sum s (which can be 3,1,-1,-3), E is -J*s.\n\nSo E can be:\n\ns=3 \u2192 E= -3J\n\ns=1 \u2192 E= -J\n\ns=-1 \u2192 E= J\n\ns=-3 \u2192 E=3J\n\nNow, I need to find how many states have each sum s.\n\nEach state corresponds to a particular combination of S1, S2, S3. Let's count how many states give each sum.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of states that lead to each sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the number of states where the sum s is 3, 1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, think about the spin configurations and count the number of states for each s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the number of states with each possible sum s.\n\nSo let's think about each case.\n\nCase 1: sum s=3.\n\nEach product S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 must be +1.\n\nWhich implies that all three spins are the same. Because S_i S_j =1 only if S_i = S_j.\n\nSo for all three products to be +1, S1=S2, S2=S3 \u2192 S1=S2=S3.\n\nSo each spin is the same. So possible states are (+,+,+), (\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). So two states.\n\nSo n=2 for s=3.\n\nCase 2: sum s=1.\n\nIn this case, two of the products are +1, one is -1.\n\nSo two products are +1, and one is -1.\n\nLet me think about how that happens.\n\nLet's say S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.\n\nWait, but S2S3=-1 would imply S2\u2260S3.\n\nBut S1S2=+1 implies S1=S2.\n\nSimilarly, S1S3=+1 implies S1=S3. So S1=S2=S3.\n\nBut then S2S3=+1, not -1. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the possible ways to have two +1 and one -1 in the products.\n\nEach product is S_i S_j.\n\nSo for two products to be +1 and one -1.\n\nLet me think about the number of such states.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider the possible configurations of the spins.\n\nFor the sum s=1, which occurs when two products are +1 and one is -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of such states is 6.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think about the possible spin configurations.\n\nEach spin is \u00b11. So all possible 8 states.\n\nLet me list all possible states and compute s for each.\n\nWait, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nList all 8 possibilities:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 products: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum s=3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 products: 1, -1, -1 \u2192 sum =1 + (-1) + (-1)= -1. So s=-1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 \u2192 products: (-1)*(-1)=1? Wait, no.\n\nWait, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nCompute S1S2: (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1S3: (+1)(+1)= +1.\n\nS2S3: (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nSum s= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2= (-1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (+1).\n\nSum s= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(+1)= +1.\n\nSum s= (-1) + (-1) + (+1)= -1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(-1)= +1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.\n\nSum s= (-1) + (+1) + (-1)= -1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2= (+1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nSum s= (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nProducts: all 1s. Sum s=3.\n\nWait, so looking at all 8 states:\n\nOnly two states have sum s=3 (states 1 and 8).\n\nThe remaining 6 states have sum s=-1.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because in the list above, states 2-7 have s=-1, except for state 3.\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nWait, no, in state 2: s = -1.\n\nState 3: s= -1.\n\nState4: s= -1.\n\nState5: s= -1.\n\nState6: s= -1.\n\nState7: s= -1.\n\nWait, that's 6 states with s=-1, and 2 with s=3.\n\nBut earlier I thought that sum s can be 3,1,-1,-3. But in this analysis, I don't see any states with s=1 or s=-3. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps my initial analysis was incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for the products.\n\nWait, let me re-examine each state.\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1)= -1.\n\nSum s = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nState3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(+1)= +1.\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nSum s = -1 +1 + (-1) = -1.\n\nState4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1), S1S3=(-1), S2S3= (+1).\n\nSum s= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = (-2) +1 = -1.\n\nState5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(+1)= +1.\n\nSum s= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.\n\nState6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nS1S2= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS1S3= (-1)(-1)= +1.\n\nS2S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.\n\nSum s= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = (-1).\n\nState7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nS1S2= (+1), S1S3= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nS2S3= (-1)(+1)= -1.\n\nSum s= (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nSo, all the other 6 states have s=-1.\n\nSo the sum can be either 3 (two states) or -1 (six states).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But according to this, only 3 and -1 are possible. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my earlier analysis. So perhaps the sum s can only be 3 and -1 in this system.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because when I thought about the possible sums, I considered that each product could be \u00b11, so the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But in reality, the way the products are related, perhaps not all combinations are possible.\n\nWait, perhaps because the three products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are not independent. For example, if S1S2 = a, S1S3 = b, then S2S3 must be a*b. Because S2S3 = (S1S2)(S1S3) / (S1^2) \u2192 since S1^2 is 1, it's a*b.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because S2S3 = (S1S2)(S1S3) * (1/S1^2) \u2192 since S1^2=1, it's (S1S2)(S1S3) = a*b. So S2S3 = a*b.\n\nSo the three products are not independent; the third is determined by the product of the first two.\n\nSo the sum s = a + b + ab.\n\nLet me compute s in terms of a and b. Let a and b be either +1 or -1.\n\nCase a=+1, b=+1 \u2192 s=1+1 +1*1=3.\n\na=+1, b=-1 \u2192 s=1 + (-1) + (1)(-1)= 1-1-1= -1.\n\na=-1, b=+1 \u2192 s=-1 +1 + (-1)(1)= 0 -1= -1.\n\na=-1, b=-1 \u2192 s=-1 + (-1) + (1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, so in all cases except when a and b are both +1, s is -1.\n\nSo s can be either 3 (when a=+1, b=+1 \u2192 s=3) or s=-1 otherwise.\n\nSo that explains why in all the states except the two where all spins are same, the sum s is -1.\n\nSo that's why in the 8 states, two have s=3 and six have s=-1.\n\nSo now, for each state, the energy E is -J times s.\n\nSo for s=3 \u2192 E = -3J.\n\nFor s=-1 \u2192 E = J.\n\nNow, the partition function Z is sum_{states} exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nEach state contributes exp(-\u03b2 E).\n\nSo for the two states with E=-3J:\n\nEach contributes exp(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = exp(3 J \u03b2).\n\nFor the six states with E=J:\n\nEach contributes exp(-\u03b2*(J)) = exp(-J \u03b2).\n\nSo Z = 2 * e^{3 J \u03b2} + 6 * e^{- J \u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 2e^(-3J\u03b2) +6e^(J\u03b2) \u2192 No, because the exponents are opposite.\n\nOption B: 2e^(3J\u03b2) +6e^(-J\u03b2) \u2192 Yes, that matches.\n\nOption C: 2e^(2J\u03b2) +6e^(-2J\u03b2) \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 6e^(2J\u03b2) +2e^(-2J\u03b2) \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the partition function \\( Z \\) for the system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), we start with the given energy expression:\n\n\\[\nE = -J \\left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \\right).\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Possible values of \\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \\)\nEach term \\( S_i S_j \\) can be \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\). The sum \\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \\) can take the values \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\). However, due to the constraint \\( S_2 S_3 = (S_1 S_2)(S_1 S_3) \\), the three terms are not independent. This reduces the possible sums to \\( 3 \\) and \\( -1 \\).\n\n- **Case 1: \\( S_1 S_2 = +1, S_1 S_3 = +1 \\)**\n  - \\( S_2 S_3 = (+1)(+1) = +1 \\), so the sum is \\( +3 \\).\n  - This corresponds to all spins being the same: \\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \\) or \\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \\). There are **2 such states**.\n\n- **Case 2: At least one of \\( S_1 S_2 \\) or \\( S_1 S_3 \\) is \\( -1 \\)**\n  - The sum \\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \\) becomes \\( -1 \\).\n  - There are **6 such states** where the spins are not all the same.\n\nThus, the possible sums are:\n- \\( s = +3 \\) (2 states),\n- \\( s = -1 \\) (6 states).\n\n### Step 2: Energy for each case\nThe energy is given by \\( E = -J \\cdot s \\):\n- For \\( s = +3 \\), \\( E = -3J \\),\n- For \\( s = -1 \\), \\( E = J \\).\n\n### Step 3: Partition function\nThe partition function is the sum of \\( e^{-\\beta E} \\) over all states:\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{states}} e^{-\\beta E}.\n\\]\n- For the 2 states with \\( E = -3J \\), each contributes \\( e^{3J\\beta} \\), so their total contribution is \\( 2e^{3J\\beta} \\).\n- For the 6 states with \\( E = J \\), each contributes \\( e^{-J\\beta} \\), so their total contribution is \\( 6e^{-J\\beta} \\).\n\nThus, the partition function is:\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Match with options\nComparing with the given options:\n- **Option A:** \\( Z = 2e^{-3J\\beta} + 6e^{J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, exponents are reversed).\n- **Option B:** \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\) (correct, matches the derived expression).\n- **Option C:** \\( Z = 2e^{2J\\beta} + 6e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, exponents are incorrect).\n- **Option D:** \\( Z = 6e^{2J\\beta} + 2e^{-2J\\beta} \\) (incorrect, exponents and coefficients are wrong).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
