Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let's think. The question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch stops in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. 

Wait, first, I need to remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces helium-4. Then there's pp-II and pp-III, which might be less significant. Oh right, pp-III involves the production of boron-8, right? So, when pp-III stops, that particular reaction isn't happening anymore.

So neutrinos are produced in various processes. The pp-I branch produces a lot of neutrinos via the beta plus decay when a proton captures a positron. But wait, the pp-III branch also produces neutrinos, perhaps specifically the neutrinos from boron-8 decay. Because boron-8 has a longer half-life, its decay emits neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, then no more boron-8 is being made, and hence no more of those neutrinos.

But wait, what about the overall neutrino flux? The Sun's core is where these reactions happen. The neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach Earth, so if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means the neutrinos from the pp-III process would have already been emitted before the process stopped. So the flux we're measuring now would be affected by the recent change.

Let me think about the neutrino energy bands. The question is about two bands: 70
