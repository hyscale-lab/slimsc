Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. There's a small cavity inside it, radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. The conductor is uncharged, but someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity. I remember that when you have a conductor with a cavity, charges inside the cavity can induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But the conductor was initially uncharged. Oh right, so the induced charges would have to cancel out the internal charge, but since it's uncharged, the inner surface must have an induced charge -q and the outer surface would have +q because it's isolated? Wait, no, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it must be zero. So the inner surface must have charge +q, but wait no: the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance that. Wait, no: conductor was uncharged, so the total induced charge must be zero.

Wait, no. The conductor was initially neutral, so when you place a charge +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. Because the cavity is inside, the conductor's charges rearrange. The outer surface must then have a charge of +q to make the total conductor's charge zero? Wait, no. Let me think again. The original conductor is uncharged, so the sum of all charges on it must be zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because that's the opposite of the cavity charge. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because: inner surface is -q, and outer is +q, so total is zero, which matches the initially uncharged conductor.

Wait, but wait: the conductor itself is neutral, so the sum of the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q. Because then (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

So, the point P is outside the conductor, so at a distance L from the conductor's center. But the conductor's radius is R, so L is greater than R. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta, where s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity. So s is the separation between the two centers.

Wait, the conductor's center and the cavity's center are separated by s. So the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. That complicates things a bit. Because when the charge is
