Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, let me think this through.

So the question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The main pp-I branch is the dominant one, right? Then there's pp-II and pp-III, which are less significant. But in this case, it's the pp-III branch that stops.

Oh wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun, specifically the electron neutrinos via the beta-plus decay steps in the pp chains. The pp-I chain produces neutrinos in the MeV range, but I think the higher energy neutrinos come from the higher branches. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up.

Wait, the pp-III chain is a higher energy process, right? Because each branching might produce higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrino production from that branch would stop as well.

But how does that affect the two bands in question? Let me think about the neutrino energies. The pp-III branch probably emits higher-energy neutrinos because it involves more energetic reactions. So if it stops, the flux in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would decrease more than in lower bands (like 700
