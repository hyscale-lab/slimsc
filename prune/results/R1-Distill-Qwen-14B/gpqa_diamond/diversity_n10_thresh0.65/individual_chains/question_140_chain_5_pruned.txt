Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and another product B. The problem gives a bunch of clues, and I need to figure out what X is and then calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it.

First, let's list out the clues.

1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X is probably a molecule where at least one of the atoms is a heavier isotope. Maybe something like NH3 with deuterium, like ND3 or NH2D?

2. X reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions could be things like acid-base reactions, especially if Y is a strong acid. Or maybe a reaction that produces gas quickly, like a carbonate reacting with an acid.

3. Gas W is released, and its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. The simplest is H2O, but wait, its molecule has 10 neutrons (O has 8, H has 1, so total 8+2=10 neutrons; O has 8 protons, H has 1 each. So in H2O: 2 H atoms (2 protons) and O (8), so total protons: 10. Neutrons: O has 8, each H has 0, so total 8. Wait, that's not equal. So H2O has 10 protons (2 H + 8 O) and 8 neutrons (since O is 16-8=8 neutrons). So 10 vs 8, not equal.

Hmm, another gas. Maybe CO2? Let's see. CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and O (8 each). So each CO2 molecule has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. Oh wait, so each CO2 molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the description. So W is CO2?

Alternatively, maybe it's something like CH4? CH4 has
