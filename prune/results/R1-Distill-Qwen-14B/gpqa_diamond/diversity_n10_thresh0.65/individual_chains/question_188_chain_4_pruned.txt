Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... I think they have all sides equal, but the angles are all the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a, a, a for the edge lengths, but the angles α, β, γ can vary. In this case, all three angles are 30 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—oh, that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the edge of the unit cell. So for a simple cubic structure, the edge length 'a' is equal to the interatomic distance. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, I think each edge is along a, b, c, which are all equal here because it's a rhombohedral system. So the unit cell edges are a = b = c = 10 Angstroms? Or wait, maybe no—no, wait, the interatomic distance is along the edges, so yes, a = 10 Angstroms.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) [for a cubic system], but wait, that's only when the angles are 90 degrees, right? Because in a general crystal system, the formula is more complicated.

Oh right, the general formula is 1/d² = (h²/l²)(sin² α / (l²)) + ... No wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is given by:

d² = (a² b² c²) / [ (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) - (h m n (cos α cos beta cos gamma) + ... ) ]

Wait, that's getting complicated. I think the general formula is d² = (a² b² c²)/(h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos γ - 2 h l cos β - 2 k l cos α). Or wait, is that correct
