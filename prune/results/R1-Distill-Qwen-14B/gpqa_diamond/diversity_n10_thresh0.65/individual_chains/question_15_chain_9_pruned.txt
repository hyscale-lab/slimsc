Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, and I need to figure out which one is more likely to transit so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, let's see what I remember about transits and the factors that affect their probability.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh wait, but wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to R_p squared divided by (R_s + R_p)^2, but for Earth-sized planets and stars, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so it approximates to (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, wait, no, another factor is the orbital inclination. The probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front of the star. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else... Oh, wait, maybe the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (2 R_s)), but I'm getting a bit confused. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, another approach: The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - eÂ²)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term becomes 1. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(something else))? Wait, not exactly. Oh wait, actually, the geometric probability of a transit is (R
