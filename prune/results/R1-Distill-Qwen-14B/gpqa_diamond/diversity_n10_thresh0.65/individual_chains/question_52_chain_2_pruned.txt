Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler, right? So if 40% of the surface is covered by darker (cooler) spots, the average temperature of the star should decrease. Oh, right, that's exactly what happens here because 5500 K is lower than 6000 K.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, without spots, the ratio is higher; with spots, it's lower. The factor is ratio_without_spots divided by ratio_with_spots.

Hmm, okay, so the photons with a wavelength of about 1448 Ã… are involved. Since this is in the stellar photosphere and we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where n is the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So the effective temperature changes, which affects the ratio.

But wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature when it has spots. The spots are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. So, does the overall photospheric effective temperature change to 5500 K, or is the temperature varying across the surface? Hmm, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait,
