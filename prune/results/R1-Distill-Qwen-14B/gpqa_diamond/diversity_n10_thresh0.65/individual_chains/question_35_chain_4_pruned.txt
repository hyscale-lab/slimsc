Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So I should write down what S looks like. 

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And then Ay = c * S, so substituting c = h/(4π), Ay becomes (h/(4π)) times that matrix. So the matrix for Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

But maybe I don't need to compute the exact matrix yet. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, and then choosing the correct statement from the options.

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving Ay |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Alternatively, since S is given, and Ay is c times S, perhaps I can first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S, then scale them by c to get Ay's.

So let me think about the matrix S. It's a 2x2 matrix. Let's find its eigenvalues. The trace of S is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = -(-(-1))? Wait, wait, i times i is i² which is -1. So (-i)*i = (-i^2) = -(-1)=1. So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (1) = -1. Wait, no, let's compute S's determinant: (0)(0) - (-i)(i) equals 0 - (-i^2) which is 0 - ( - (-1) ) because i² = -1. So that's 0 - (1) = -1? Or wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1)=1. So the determinant is -1. So the trace is 0, determinant is -1.

Wait,
