Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh wait, so S is a Pauli matrix, I think. I remember the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each with specific forms.

So the first thing I should do is figure out what matrix A_y looks like. Let's calculate it. Since c = h/(4π), then A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So multiplying each element of S by c.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply by c, the matrix becomes:
A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So to write it out, the elements are:
A_y[1,1] = 0,
A_y[1,2] = -(i h)/(4π),
A_y[2,1] = (i h)/(4π),
A_y[2,2] = 0.

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (A_y - a I):
[ -a , -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * -(i h)/(4π) ) ].

Calculating each part:

First term: a².

Second term: [ (i h)/(4π) ) * ( -i h/(4π) ) ] = (i*(-i)) * (h²)/( (4π)^2 )

But i*(-i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1)*(h²)/(16 π²).

So determinant equation: a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Wait, no, because the second term in the determinant is subtracted, right? So the determinant is a² - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that term again. The product is (i h/(4π)) * ( -i h/(4π) ) = (i * -i) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) 

i*(-i) is -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the product is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

Setting this equal to zero: a² = h
