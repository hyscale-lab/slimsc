Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see. The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that for spin operators, especially in the Pauli matrices context, the eigenvectors correspond to spin-up or spin-down states along a given direction.

Wait, the question gives me the components of P. Oh right, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as ħ/2 times some 2x2 matrix. I think those matrices are the Pauli matrices. Let me recall: the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is indeed σx. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is σy multiplied by -i? Or wait, no—actually, σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So yes, that's σy. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σz.

So the operator P is the vector operator, meaning P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so that would mean the y-component of n is zero. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction vector n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So n_y is zero. So the operator P would be n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the operator is given as P, so I'm supposed to find the eigenvector for this operator. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Hmm, so the operator is P = n_x (ħ/2 σx) + n_z (ħ/2 σz). Let me write that as (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz). So the matrix form is (ħ/2) times (n_x [ [0 1; 1 0] ] + n_z [ [1 0; 0 -1] ]).

Wait, let me compute that. The matrix inside is:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z*[[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z,
