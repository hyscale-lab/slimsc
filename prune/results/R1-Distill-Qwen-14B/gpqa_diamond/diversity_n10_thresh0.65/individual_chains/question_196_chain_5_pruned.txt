Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I can't use the classical formulas directly.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the energy is conserved. The potential energy of a spring is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². At maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum, so all the potential energy is converted. So, at maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². Setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the non-relativistic case. So option C might be the classical answer, but since we're dealing with relativity, it's probably not the right choice.

Now, I'm not exactly sure how relativity affects this. I remember that in special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's more complicated. The total energy includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). And the kinetic energy is E - mc².

So in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. But wait, potential energy in relativity? Hmm, I'm not sure. I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So when the mass is at x=0 (maximum speed), the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me think again. At x=A, the potential energy is maximum, so all the energy stored is in the spring. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², but in relativistic terms, this E would equal the total energy of the mass, which is gamma mc². So E =
