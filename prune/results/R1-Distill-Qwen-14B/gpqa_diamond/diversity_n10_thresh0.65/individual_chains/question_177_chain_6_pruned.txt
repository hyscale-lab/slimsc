Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to take my time to think through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is Luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

Wait, but there's another part: the wavelength at which they appear brightest is the same. Oh, right! That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation, which is determined by Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law says λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K).

So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be inversely proportional to each other. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So T1 / T2 = λ2 / λ1. But since λ_max is same, T1 = T2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, the peak wavelength is the same for both. So then their temperatures must be the same? Because λ_max*T = constant, so if λ_max is same, T must be same. Or wait, wait a second. Wait, no—Wien's law says λ_max * T = b (a constant), so T = b / λ_max. If λ_max is the same for both, then T must be same for both. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are different. Star_1 is at rest, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But that's radial velocity, which affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right, so the measured wavelength max would be different, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are same, but their actual emission peak wavelengths would be different because of Doppler shift.

Wait, that's a different point. So the observed λ_max is same for both stars, but their actual emission λ_max (before considering Doppler shift) is different. So I need to account for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelength.

So let me think. The star's actual emission peak is λ_em. But due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_em multiplied by (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, the formula depends on whether the star is moving towards or away. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so v_r is positive when moving away.

Wait, the formula for Doppler shift when the source is moving away (v_r positive) is λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r/c). And when the source is moving towards the observer, v_r would be negative, leading to a blueshift.

In this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_em1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. But wait, 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.00233c). So the Doppler effect would make Star_2's observed wavelength longer or shorter?

If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c). Since v_r is positive (700 km/s away), so λ_obs2 is longer.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_em1 (since v_r1=0). For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c). So set them equal:

λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But wait, another point. Each star emits at its own temperature. So using Wien's law, λ_em1 = b / T1, and λ_em2 = b / T2.

So substituting into the earlier equation:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

The b's cancel out:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

So 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2

Rearranged, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c) )

Wait, but wait, if the star is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, which implies that the emitted wavelength is shorter (since λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c), so λ_em = λ_obs / (1 + v/c)). So perhaps I should be careful with which way the Doppler shift is applied.

Alternatively, perhaps using the correct Doppler formula for observed wavelength. Let me think again.

When a star is moving away, the wavelengths of its emitted light are stretched (redshifted). So λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c). So the observed peak wavelength is longer than the emitted one.

But according to the problem, the
