Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, right. Let's tackle each part one by one. First, the relative speed. Wait, when dealing with speeds at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because that would violate the speed limit of c. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u2 - u1) / (1 - (u1*u2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, that's when one is moving at u relative to another. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait no, actually, I think I have it backwards. Because v1 and v2 are their speeds relative to the same frame. So let me define it properly.

Let me think. Let's say the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So the first astronaut is moving at v1 = 0.6c, and the second at v2 = 0.5c, but wait, no, the problem says 2m is moving at 0.6c and 3m at 0.5c. So in the same direction, so the faster one is 0.6c. So from the perspective of the 3m astronaut, how fast is the 2m astronaut moving relative to them?

Wait, no, wait. No, the problem is asking for the relative speed between them, but which one's frame are we considering? Hmm. The question isn't clear on that. Oh wait, no, wait. The question says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?"

Wait, the relative speed between the two astronauts. So from the perspective of one astronaut, what is the speed of the other. So we have to compute the relative speed using the velocity addition formula.

But wait, what's the exact formula again? The formula for the relative velocity u' between two objects moving at u
