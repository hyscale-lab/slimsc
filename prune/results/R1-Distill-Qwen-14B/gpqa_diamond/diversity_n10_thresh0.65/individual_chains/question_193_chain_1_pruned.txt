Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. My task is to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star. So, a star's parallax is inversely proportional to its distance. Like, plx = 1/distance, but wait, I think it's in parsecs, right? So distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds.

So if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since I want to find how N changes with distance d, I can substitute plx in terms of d.

Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, does that mean the differential number of stars with distance? Like, how many stars are there as you move a small distance dr?

I think I might need to consider differential quantities here. Let's think in terms of differentials.

If N is proportional to d^5, then perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be related to the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating it. Let's see. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars within a certain distance range is what's being considered. But the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So per unit distance, so it's the rate of change.

So, N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dr is the change in number of stars per unit distance. So dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, the question is about the change with distance, which would be the derivative.

Wait, but the options don't have d^4 as an option. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2. So if the derivative is proportional to r^4, then the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check. The way the problem states, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

And since plx = 1/d, 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant.

So N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases
