Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with infinities that appear in loop calculations. It's a way to make the calculations finite and then remove the regularization by taking a limit, like the cutoff going to infinity or something. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have different structures.

Let me go through each option:

A) Superstring Theory. I think superstring theory is a type of string theory which is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. I remember that in string theory, the basic objects are strings rather than point particles. Since strings have different vibrational modes, maybe this leads to a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as point particle theories. Or wait, do they still require regularization? I'm a bit confused. I think string theory might not require the same kind of regularization because the calculations are different, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's the opposite; string theories have their own methods of handling things, but whether they need regularization... I'll have to think more.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and that it's asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, which is why perturbation theory works. But wait, when dealing with things like the running of the coupling constant or calculating loop diagrams, you might get divergences. So QCD probably requires regularization, perhaps using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So B might need regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. It's a well-established theory and one of the first that was quantized. I remember that in QED, you have divergent loop integrals, like the electron self-energy and the vacuum polarization. These infinities are handled by renormalization, which includes regularization as a step. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C needs it.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right! Classical theories, like Maxwell's equations, don't have the same issues as quantum theories. They don't involve the infinities that come from quantum loop corrections because they're not quantizing the fields. So in classical E&M, you don't need regularization because you don't have the divergent integrals that appear in quantum field theories. Regularization is a quantum mechanical thing, so a classical theory wouldn't require it.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The question is about high energies. Classical electrodynamics breaks down at high energies because it can't account for quantum effects, but the question is about whether the theory requires regularization. Since regularization is part of the process in quantum theories, classical theories don't need it. So option D never requires regularization.

So which theories don't need regularization? The options are which theory never requires it. So looking for the one that doesn't need regularization at high energies.

Wait, but what about Superstring Theory? Do they need regularization? I'm trying to recall. String theory calculations involve different kinds of divergences. For example, the early attempts (like the original string theory before the superstring revolution) had problems with certain divergences, but I think the superstring theories (type I, IIA, IIB, etc.) have better behavior. They might not require the same kind of regularization as point particle theories because their perturbative expansions (like the expansion in the string coupling) don't have the same divergences. Or perhaps they do, but in a different way.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory doesn't have divergences, it wouldn't need regularization. But
