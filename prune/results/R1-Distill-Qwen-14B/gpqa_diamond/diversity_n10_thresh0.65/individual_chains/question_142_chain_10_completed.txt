Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, what's the geometrical position here? Oh right, when you have a qubit, it can be represented as a point in a 3D space using the Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be mapped to a vector on this sphere.

Let me recall the Bloch vector representation. For a pure state |ψ>, the vector would be (x, y, z), where x, y, z are related to the coefficients in the state. But for a mixed state, things are a bit different. I think the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's expand the given ρ. The given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I know that |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top left and 0s elsewhere, and |1><1| is 1 in the bottom right. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So ρ is (1/2) times that, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, but according to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, I is the identity matrix. The identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when we include (I), that's [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]] already. So when I set up the equation:

( I + r·σ ) / 2 = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives I + r·σ = I. So r·σ must be zero. Because if I add something to the identity matrix and it equals the identity matrix, that something has to be zero.

Hmm, so r·σ = 0. What's r·σ? The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

Wait, but if r·σ is zero, then each component must be zero? Because the Pauli matrices are all traceless and don't commute. Oh wait, no, that's not the case. For the sum to be zero, each component must be zero. So r_x must be zero, r_y must be zero, and r_z must be zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

So the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. That represents the completely mixed state, which makes sense because ρ here is a completely mixed state of |0> and |1> each with 50% probability. So for a mixed state that's maximally mixed, the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubits space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general density matrix, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is related to the density matrix by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the given \( \rho \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Multiplying through by 2 gives:

\[
I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = I.
\]

This implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this can only be true if \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). Thus, the density matrix corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere, representing a maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:
- Option A (\( r = (1,1,0) \)) and Option D (\( r = (1,1,1) \)) represent pure states, which is incorrect.
- Option B (\( r = (0,0,1) \)) represents a state along the \( z \)-axis, which is also incorrect.
- Option C (\( r = (0,0,0) \)) correctly represents the origin, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
