Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four reactions in the scheme, each leading to the next compound. Plus, there are some hints provided, so I should definitely make use of those.

Let me start by jotting down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are four different cycloketones, so E is a cyclic ketone. That makes sense because the last step involves elimination, which often leads to ring formation or double bonds, but combined with the IR data, which suggests a ketone.

Let me think about each step.

First, the initial reaction: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups, right? So if A is a ketone, HCN would add to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. The product would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent to each other.

So if A is a ketone, then B is a cyanohydrin. Let me think about the structure.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, which usually adds H2 across double bonds. So if B has a double bond, like maybe from the initial addition, the reduction would saturate it.

Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin. Let me draw that. Suppose A is cyclopentanone. Then, adding HCN would give something like 4-cyanocyclopentanol, but wait, no, because the cyanohydrin would have the OH and CN on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is
