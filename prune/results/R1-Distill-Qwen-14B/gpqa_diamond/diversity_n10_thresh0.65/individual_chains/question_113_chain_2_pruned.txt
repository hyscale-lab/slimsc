Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I want to get it right. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with C6H something O or O2. So the first thing I'll do is go through each piece of data and see what they tell me.

Starting with the FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually suggest O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Another peak at 1700 cm^-1 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range for carbonyl groups. 1700 is often a carbonyl like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be conjugated or something else, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl, like a conjugated carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ester or something else. Wait, or maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch? No, wait, C=C is usually around 1600-1680. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups, like in an aromatic ketone or an ester.

So, putting that together, the compound likely has a carbonyl group (from 1700) and possibly another group like an alcohol or maybe another carbonyl? Or maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or amide. But wait, amides have N-H stretches which would show up elsewhere, but I don't know yet. Let me think: another possibility is that 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond. That adds to the structure; maybe it's an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond, etc.

And the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a (CH3)2O group, but wait, (CH3)2O's molecular weight is 45 (C:12, H:2*1, O:16 â†’ 12 + 2 +16=30? Wait, no, 12*2 +1*6 +1
