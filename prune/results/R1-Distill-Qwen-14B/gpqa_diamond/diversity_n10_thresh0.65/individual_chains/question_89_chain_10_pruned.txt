Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then it goes through several steps, and finally asks about the NMR coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in product 3. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on adamantane derivatives, but let me try to break this down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, and the 1H NMR shows specific signals. The IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is around the carbonyl region (C=O). So maybe an epoxide or a ketone? Wait, KOH usually deprotonates things, but in this case, since we have two bromines, perhaps it's an elimination reaction? Or maybe a substitution.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh wait, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihaloalkanes) react with a base, they typically undergo elimination to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal, it's 1,3 positions. So that's more of a di-substitution. Maybe it's a double elimination? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs in specific positions. When heated with KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps it leads to elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene? Or maybe a ring-opening epoxide? Wait, no, because the IR shows a carbonyl. Maybe it's an epoxide formation? Wait, no, epoxide would have a different IR. Wait, another thought: when a dihalide reacts with a strong base, maybe it forms a ketone. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the product's NMR. The signals are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So 10H in the 2-2.4 region, which perhaps are
