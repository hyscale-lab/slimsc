Okay, so I need to figure out the NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Let me go through each step of the reaction to understand what's happening.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dealing with dibrominated compounds, especially vicinal dihalides (two adjacent bromines), this usually leads to an elimination reaction. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent; the positions are 1 and 3 on the adamantane structure. Oh, right, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons in a certain arrangement. So when treated with KOH, it's likely an E2 elimination. Since it's heated, it's a dehydrohalogenation.

Elimination would form a double bond. How many rings are in adamantane? Well, adamantane is a bicyclic structure with four six-membered rings, so when two bromine atoms are removed, the structure would form a bridged double bond. Wait, or would it form a more stable structure? Maybe it's a ring-opening or expansion? Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination would form a double bond across the bridge. 

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might have the two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and two hydrogens are abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexene derivative within the adamantane structure.

The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where vinyl protons appear. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) likely corresponds to the bridgehead and adjacent methylene groups in adamantane. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a methylene group adjacent to a double bond. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Wait, 1720 is more like a ketone or ester. But product 1 is from elimination of HBr, which would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe
