Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking what the pH will be at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given from A to D.

Alright, first, I need to understand what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we titrate it with NaOH (a strong base), the reaction should form acetate ions and water. The pH at different points will depend on the amounts of acid and conjugate base present.

Let's break it down into parts. First, the initial solution after dilution. Then, the titration process, focusing on 25% and equivalence points.

So step one: Calculate the initial concentration after dilution.

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then adding 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³, right? So the new concentration would be (volume1 × concentration1) / total volume.

Wait, yeah, because when you dilute, the number of moles stays the same, and concentration changes with volume. So moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially is 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters). That's 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. 20 mL to 20 mL water, so total 40 mL. So yeah, 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. So let's see how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001, as calculated. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. Since the concentration is 0.1 M, the volume would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait a second. Because when we go to titrate, the initial volume is 40 mL (diluted solution). So when titrating, the NaOH is added until the moles are equal.

So the equivalence point occurs when 10 mL of NaOH is added, right? Because 10 mL * 0.1 M = 0.001 moles.

Now, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point. That would be 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

So let's tackle the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

First, pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added to the 40 mL diluted acetic acid solution.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, this will neutralize 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to form CH3COO^-.

So, initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

So this is a buffer solution situation. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me calculate pKa.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's approximate. Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is approximately 4.733, around 4.73.

Now, the concentrations of [A^-] and [HA] in the solution. Since we're adding NaOH to 40 mL of solution, the volume will change. Let's compute the total volume after adding 2.5 mL.

Total volume = 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

Molarity of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

Molarity of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M.

So, [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253.

Wait, looking at the options, the first part of the answer is either 4.26, 3.17, 4.73, or 4.57. So 4.253 is close
