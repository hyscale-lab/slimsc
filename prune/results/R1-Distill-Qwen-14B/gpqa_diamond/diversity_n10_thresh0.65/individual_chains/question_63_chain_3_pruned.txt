Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a diatomic molecule, right? The elements are X and Y. I remember that in these models, the molecule can be treated as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe it's a vibration thing too.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So when a photon is absorbed, it has to switch to the next lowest energy state. But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. I need to find the momentum that the photon must have to cause this transition.

The given data are the masses of X and Y: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So, I guess I need to calculate the energy difference between the two states and then find the photon's momentum corresponding to that energy.

Wait, but wait. The model is the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state would be the combination of the ground states for both rotation and vibration. When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next higher state. But what's the next possible state? In quantum mechanics, transitions are usually governed by selection rules. For diatomic molecules, rotational and vibrational transitions have specific selection rules.

For the rotation part, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, where J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration, the selection rule is Δv = ±1. But since the molecule is going from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, I need to see what the next state is. The next lowest energy state after the fundamental would be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). But wait, which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Wait, but the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So the molecule would preferentially transition to the state with the smallest possible energy increase. So I need to compare the energies of the first vibrational and first rotational excitations and choose the one with lower energy.

Let me compute both energies.

First, the vibrational energy levels. The energy for
