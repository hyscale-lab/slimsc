Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, okay. I remember that the molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's break it down: each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, but here there's no X, so N comes into play. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's calculate that: (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds or 4 degrees for the ring plus three double bonds?), wait, no, a benzene ring is three double bonds and a ring, so that's 4 degrees. So if we have a benzene ring, that's four degrees, leaving one more. So the remaining could be another double bond or a ring, or maybe another functional group.

Looking at the NMR data: 1H-NMR (ppm). The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). 

Let me try to interpret the NMR. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which is a singlet for an aldehyde proton, but wait, it's a triplet. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But this is a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to something with two protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and are typically split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group, but that's not too common. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with coupling to two adjacent protons. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

Then, 6.98 as a doublet (d) for 2H, and 6.51 another doublet for 2H. That might suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the coupling between protons on adjacent carbons (ortho positions) would give a doublet. Wait, actually, let me think: for an aromatic ring with two substituents in para positions, the protons on the ring could each couple with their adjacent (ortho) protons. Wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So for example, two substituents in para positions, each with their own set of protons as doublets.

Then, 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet could be from an enol or something with exchange, like an -OH group, but wait, 2H as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some other system. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with two protons that are equivalent and not splitting each other, like in a para substitution but with two substituents that each have no adjacent protons. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet with 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe -OCH2- or something similar. Or perhaps an adjacent double bond, like in an enol structure.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aromatic ring with substituents and an aldehyde group. Wait, but the aldehyde is at 9.72. Let me think: possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Because benzaldehyde is C7H6O, so this has more carbons and hydrogens.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe a benzene ring with some substituents, an aldehyde group, and an oxygen-containing group.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm peak (triplet, 1H) is probably the aldehyde proton. But why a triplet? Because perhaps it's adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO. But wait, that would give the aldehyde proton adjacent to CH2, leading to a triplet. Let me think: the aldehyde is at the end of a chain. So maybe the structure is something like (substituted benzene)-CH2-CHO.

But then, the
