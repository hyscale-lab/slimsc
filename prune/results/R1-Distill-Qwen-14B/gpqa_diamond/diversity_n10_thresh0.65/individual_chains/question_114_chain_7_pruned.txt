Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, there are two reactions given, and I need to find out which reagents A and B are used in each step. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different choices for A and B.

First, let's break down the first reaction. The reactant is butan-2-one, which I think is methylacetone. The structure is (CH3)2CO. The reagents involved are NaCN and A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, so what's happening here? Oh, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. But wait, ketones usually don't undergo SN2 easily because the carbonyl is a good leaving group but the adjacent carbon isn't very good for backside attack. Did I get that right?

Wait, butan-2-one has the carbonyl group on carbon 2. So when NaCN is added, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's a ketone reacting with a cyanide in an addition reaction. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think, when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN-, perhaps it's an example of a cyanohydrin formation. I remember that the cyanide adds to the carbonyl group, forming a new alcohol and a nitrile group.

So the reaction would be: ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But that usually requires some kind of acid catalyst, right? Because the cyanide is a weak nucleophile. So maybe A is an acid. So A is H3O+ or something else?

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon, adjacent to two methyl groups. So that's the cyanohydrin product.

So the first step is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+ or maybe another acid. Let's see the options. Options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is using HCN and a base, but I don't think so because the reagent is NaCN, which would be a source of CN-.

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN +
