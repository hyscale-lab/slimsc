Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is asking about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom, and all three angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees each. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is correct.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... Right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is based on a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been deformed. All the edges are of equal length, a, and all angles are equal. In this case, a is 10 Angstrom because the interatomic distance is given as 10. Or wait, wait—wait, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a? Hmm. I think for a simple cubic structure, yes, because each atom is at the corner and the distance between adjacent atoms is a. But rhombohedral has the same a for all edges, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a special case where a = 10 Angstroms.

The interplanar distance—oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for the interplanar distance d for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is given by the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + kl + lh) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ) / (1 - cos α cos β cos γ) ) )

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I should think about the general formula for interplanar distances. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos β + lh cos α) )) )

Wait no, wait. Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees, so cos terms become zero. But in a rhombohedral system, the angles are not 90. So I think the general formula applies.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. From what I remember, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β) )

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles α, β, γ are equal. So let's denote them all as θ. So all α,β,γ =30 degrees in this case.

So substituting into the formula, for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So d = a / sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) - 2*(1*1 * cos θ + 1*1 * cos θ + 1*1 * cos θ ) )

Because all angles are same, right? So each cos term is cos(30°).

Wait, wait, let
