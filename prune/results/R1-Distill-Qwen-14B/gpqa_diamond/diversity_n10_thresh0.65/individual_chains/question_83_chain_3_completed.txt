Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I remember some key points.

The problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases, which will affect its pH. Wait, no, actually, the first part is about the solution before titration, right? Because titration is adding NaOH to it. So the initial solution is diluted acetic acid.

Wait, no, the initial solution is diluted, and then titrated. So first step is to find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid.

The initial moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So let's find out how much moles that is.

The total moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, 0.04 L, so moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Right. So 25% titration means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, that would convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So, the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution. Because some of the acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

So, the concentrations: originally, we had 0.025 M CH3COOH. After adding NaOH, some of it becomes acetate. So the moles of HA (acetic acid) will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of A- (acetate) will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the volume? Because when we add NaOH, we also add some volume. Oh, wait, I think in titration problems, sometimes we can neglect the volume change if the amount added is small, but here, since it's a 25% titration, perhaps the volume is significant. Alternatively, the total volume is 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the volume change due to the addition of NaOH for each part. Maybe the first step is to consider the dilution, then the NaOH addition.

Wait, but wait. Initially, the volume is 40 cm³. Let's assume that the NaOH is added in small enough amounts that the volume change is negligible, or the problem expects us to ignore it. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated as each addition of NaOH changes the volume, which affects the concentrations.

So, perhaps it's safe to assume that the volume remains approximately 40 cm³ for the 25% point. Or perhaps, more accurately, the total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Hmm, but in the problem, when they say 25% titration, how much NaOH is added?

Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. The NaOH required for equivalence is 0.001 moles, because 1:1 ratio. So the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So 25% titration would mean adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume at 25% would be 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. That's 0.0425 L.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the volume change. Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Let's proceed both ways and see.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is set up so that the volume is the initial solution's volume plus the added NaOH. But for the sake of the problem, perhaps the volume is considered the same as the initial, but that might lead to errors. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume is the same as the initial solution (40 cm³), because the NaOH added is 25% of the required volume. Wait, but 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So the total volume would be 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects that the solution is diluted to 40 cm³, and the NaOH is added without considering the volume change, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the initial dilution and the moles, and doesn't require considering the volume change for the buffer calculation, assuming that the added NaOH is a small volume compared to the total solution. Alternatively, perhaps the volume is considered to be 40 cm³, as the initial solution's volume, and the added NaOH is negligible.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try both approaches.

Approach 1: Volume is 40 cm³ plus the added NaOH. For 25% equivalence, it's 2.5 cm³, so total volume 42.5 cm³.

Approach 2: Volume remains 40 cm³, and NaOH is added without changing the volume.

Let me proceed with Approach 2 first, assuming the volume remains 40 cm³.

So, for the 25% titration point:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

Concentrations:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.04 = 0.01875 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.04 = 0.00625 M.

Wait, but wait, if the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), then yes, the concentrations are as above.

Now, the pKa is log(1.85e-5) → let's compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1/1.85) + 5 → log(0.5405) ≈ -0.269 → So pKa ≈ 4.73 (since 10^-4.74 ≈ 1.8e-5, but let's double-check.

Wait, 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267 → so pKa = 5 - 0.267 ≈ 4.733. So pKa ≈4.73.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.73 + log(0.00625 / 0.01875).

0.00625 / 0.01875 = (6.25e-3)/(1.875e-2) ) = (6.25/18.75) = 1/3. So log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.25.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 0.00625 / 0.01875 is 0.333..., so log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH is around 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 → 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; D is 4.57. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe I should recalculate.

Wait, another approach: the [A^-] is 0.00025 mol, and [HA] is 0.00075 mol. So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So same as before.

So pH would be around 4.25, which is close to option A's first value, 4.26. So maybe that's the 25% point.

Now, the equivalence point: that's when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, at equivalence, all the acetic acid becomes acetate ions. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

So, the moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added (from earlier calculation: 0.001 mol NaOH is 10 cm³ × 0.1 M). So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 1/(1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction can be represented as:

A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration of A^- is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, some x will have dissociated. So:

[HA] = x, [OH^-] = x, [A^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x is negligible).

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02) → x = sqrt( Kb * 0.02 ) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → let's compute that.

5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

The square root of 1.081e-11 is approximately 1.04e-5.5 → Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * 1e-5.5 → sqrt(1.081) is ~1.04, so 1.04e-5.5 M, which is 1.04e-5.5 ≈ 3.16e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.16e-6 M.

pOH = log(1/(3.16e-6)) → log(3.16e5) → approx 5.5 (since log(3.16e5) = log(3.16) + 5 ≈ 0.5 +5=5.5).

Wait, wait, more accurately: log(3.16e-6) is negative, but pOH is -log[OH^-].

So [OH^-]=3.16e-6 → pOH=5.5.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -5.5=8.5.

Looking at the options, option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which is close to 8.5. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.5.

Wait, but let's recalculate the Kb and the pH more accurately.

Wait, another approach: the hydrolysis of acetate.

Let me compute Kb again.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10, as before.

Concentration c = 0.02 M.

The expression is Kb = [HA][OH^-]/[A^-].

We can approximate [A^-] ≈ c, so [HA] = [OH^-] = x.

So x² = Kb * c → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.5 → 1.04e-5.5 = 3.16e-6.

Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6 because 1e-5 is 1e-5, 1e-6 is 0.1e-5. 5.5 is halfway between 5 and 6, so sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5=3.16e-6.

So x=3.16e-6 → [OH^-] = 3.16e-6 M. pOH = -log(3.16e-6) → log(3.16)=0.5, so 6-0.5=5.5 → pOH=5.5 → pH=8.5.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. Close to our calculation.

Wait, but I'm getting pH at equivalence as 8.5, but option A says 8.52, which is very close. So option A's equivalence point is near 8.52, which is consistent.

Wait, but earlier when calculating the 25% titration, I assumed the volume remained 40 cm³. But if I include the added NaOH volume, the concentration would change a bit.

Wait, let me recalculate the 25% titration with the volume change.

At 25%, we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Which is correct.

The initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

After adding NaOH, moles of HA: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of A^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Wait, same ratio as before. Because 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3, and when divided by the same volume, the ratio remains the same. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would give the same result, pH ≈4.25.

Hmm, so that part doesn't change. So the pH at 25% is around 4.25.

Looking back at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So this would match.

Wait, but let's check the other option, option D: 4.57;6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH at 25% without using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but by considering the buffer solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the exact concentrations after considering the volume change.

Wait, or perhaps I should consider that the solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when 25% of it is titrated, which is 0.001 mol * 0.25 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added, which converts 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate.

So the moles are HA: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075, A^-: 0.00025.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → pKa is 4.73, log(1/3) is -0.477 → 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, so 4.25. So the pH is about 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

Wait, perhaps we should compute pKa more precisely. Let me compute pKa accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no, wait. pKa is -log(Ka) → -log(1.85e-5).

Compute log(1.85) = 0.2672. So log(1.85e-5) = 0.2672 -5= -4.7328.

So pKa = 4.7328.

So pH at 25% is 4.7328 + log(1/3) → log(1/3) is -0.4771.

So pH = 4.7328 -0.4771 = 4.2557 → approximately 4.26. So that's why option A says 4.26.

So option A is: 4.26;8.52.

Wait, but what about the equivalence point? Earlier calculation said pH=8.5, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the equivalence point more accurately.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate in 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02) → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that more accurately.

sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * 1e-5.5 → sqrt(1.081)=1.039 → 1.039e-5.5.

Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6, so 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.516 → so pOH =5.484 → pH=14-5.484=8.516.

So pH=8.52, which matches option A's second value.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, which corresponds to option A.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. That doesn't seem to fit with what we calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the volume at 25% titration. Let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the solution after dilution as 0.025 M, and then when titrated, the volume is taken as the same as the initial solution plus the added NaOH.

Wait, but earlier calculations showed that the pH at 25% is about 4.25 or 4.26, and equivalence at 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches. So I think the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes, in some problems, when you dilute the acetic acid, the pH doesn't just depend on the initial concentration but also on the dilution. Oh wait, but in this case, the initial solution is diluted, and then titrated. But the question is about the pH at certain points during the titration.

So, putting it all together, the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26 and at equivalence it's 8.52. So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and equivalence. The key steps are as follows:

---

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid**:  
   The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L).  
   The new concentration is:  
   \[
   \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
   \]

2. **Reaction with NaOH**:  
   The reaction is:  
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{Na}^+ + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
   \]  
   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. The total moles of acetic acid initially are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.00025 mol of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)).

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, the solution is a buffer containing both acetic acid (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}\)) and acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). The concentrations are:  
\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.001 - 0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]  
The ratio is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]  
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting:  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) in a total volume of 50.00 cm³ (0.05 L). The concentration of acetate is:  
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]  
Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]  
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \(K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\). Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:  
\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]  
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]  
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.  

**Answer: A**
