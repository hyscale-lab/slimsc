Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to figure it out.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and thiocyanate is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, like Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the complexes' stability constants are β1, β2, etc. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but not always. So higher β means more stable complex. Let me think about the possible complexes.

Cobalt can form various complexes with SCN-. The possible complexes are:

Co^2+ (no ligands),
Co(SCN)^+ (one SCN, charge +1),
Co(SCN)_2^0 (two SCN, neutral),
Co(SCN)_3^- (three SCN, charge -1),
Co(SCN)_4^2- (four SCN, charge -2).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the charges wrong. Cobalt is Co^2+. Each SCN- is -1. So:

- Co^2+ → charge is +2.
- Co(SCN) → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is +1.
- Co(SCN)_2 → Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → charge is 0.
- Co(SCN)_3 → Co^2+ +3 SCN^- → charge is -1.
- Co(SCN)_4 → Co^2+ +4 SCN^- → charge is -2.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, each SCN- contributes -1. So for each ligand added, the charge decreases by 1. So:

n=0: Co^2+ → charge +2.
n=1: Co(SCN) → Co^2+ + SCN^- → complex charge is +1.
n=2: Co(SCN)_2 → charge 0.
n=3: Co(SCN)_3 → charge -1.
n=4: Co(SCN)_4 → charge -2.

So the stability constants
