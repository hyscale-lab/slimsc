Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the formulas, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, astronomers are looking at two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 times larger. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so I think mass might not directly affect that here—maybe it's a distractor.

They did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, then T must be the same, assuming they're blackbodies.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Oh, right—radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, its spectrum shifts. The star with a higher radial velocity would have its light shifted more. 

So, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Let me think about whether it's moving towards or away. Radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. Hmm, the sign would indicate direction, but since it's just given as 700, perhaps it's moving away? Or maybe it's a blueshift? Wait, but the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 is stationary relative to us, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 would be shifted.

Wait, but earlier the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed peak wavelengths are the same. But according to Wien's Law, the true peak is determined by their actual temperatures. So if one is moving, its observed wavelength would be different from its actual peak. So to have the same observed peak, their actual temperatures must be adjusted so that the Doppler shift brings
