Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and exoplanet detection. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots that take up 20% of the hemisphere's area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere has spots, the star's brightness changes as it rotates, which is similar to what we'd see with an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The main goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve. So, we need to compare the brightness variations caused by the spots and the planet.

First, I remember that the brightness variation (or the change in flux) from a planet transit is given by the formula (R_planet / R_star)^2. That's because the planet blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the square of their radii ratio.

Now, the star's brightness variation due to spots is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into and out of view, the star's overall brightness changes. The amplitude of this variation depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

The problem states that the filling factor is 20%. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total area covered is 20% of half the star's surface. Wait, no—wait, no, the star's surface area is 4πR², so each hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 0.2 for the hemisphere, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view as they move. So the maximum variation would depend on how much the spots contribute to the star's brightness.

The star's total brightness without spots would be L = 4πR² * σT^4. But with spots, the brightness is a bit less. When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the brightness is L = (4πR² - area of spots) * σT^4 + area of spots * σ(T-ΔT)^4.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to
