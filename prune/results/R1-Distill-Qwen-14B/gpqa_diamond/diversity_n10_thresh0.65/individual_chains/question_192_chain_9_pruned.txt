Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and at a distance l from the center of the cavity. Also, l and L are both larger than R, which means P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. For one, the charges in a conductor reside on the surface when electrostatic equilibrium is reached. Also, the electric field inside a conductor material is zero. But here, the conductor is uncharged, so I guess the charges inside the cavity will induce some charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, let's think: when you have a conductor with a cavity and a charge inside the cavity, the charge induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was initially neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, right? And since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q induced, because the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the induced charges inside and outside must balance each other.

So in this case, the cavity has +q, so the inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So what's the electric field there? I remember that for a spherical shell of charge, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the outer surface of the conductor, which has +q, will contribute to the electric field at P as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, which is outside R. So the field due to the outer charge should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². But wait, there's another consideration. The charge inside the cavity is at a different position, which might affect things.
