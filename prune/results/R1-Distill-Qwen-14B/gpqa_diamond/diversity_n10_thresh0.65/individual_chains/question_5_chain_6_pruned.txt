Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. They give the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle, but since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the direction is along θ in the x-z plane.

But wait, the operator is P, which I think is the spin operator. So, the operator is P = ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices, but along some direction n. So the general form of a spin operator in direction n is P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But in this case, n is along x-z plane, so n_y=0. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

But wait, the question gives me the individual components Px
