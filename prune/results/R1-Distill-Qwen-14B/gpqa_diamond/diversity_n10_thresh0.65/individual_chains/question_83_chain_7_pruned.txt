Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Okay, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Here's what I remember: Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the reaction produces the conjugate base of the acid (acetate ion) and water.

The problem states that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes due to dilution. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. 

Wait, wait. Original volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial concentration is 0.05 M. So after dilution, the new concentration (C1) is M1 * V1 / V_total.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V_total is 40 cm³. So 0.05 * 20 /40 = (1) /40 *0.05? Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. Oh, wait, wait: 0.05 M * 20 cm³ is 1 mmol (because 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol). Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L), the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration is 1 mmol / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Wait, but how do I find out how much NaOH is added at 25%?

Wait, perhaps I should find the equivalence point first. Because the equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001. So to reach equivalence, you need 0.001 mol of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume at equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, maybe another approach is better. The 25% titration refers to the amount of acid neutralized. So moles of NaOH added at 25% would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

So, when we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH are 0.1 mol/L * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol, which matches. So that's correct.

Now, let's model the solution at 25% titration. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Initially, the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid.

So, the moles of CH3COOH left = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution is the initial diluted volume plus the added NaOH. So 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH
