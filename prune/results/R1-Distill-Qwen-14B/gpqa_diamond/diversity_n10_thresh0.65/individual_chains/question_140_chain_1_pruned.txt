Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Then, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially X and its analog.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Oh, and if there are multiple isotopes, sum all of them. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's start with the reaction.

When X reacts with Y, it releases gas W. W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So protons in a molecule (since it's a diatomic or maybe triatomic?) but wait, for a molecule, the number of neutrons and protons in the molecule would be the sum. Let me think. For example, if W is H2O, that doesn't make sense because H and O have different numbers. Wait, perhaps W is something like O2 or another diatomic gas. Wait, but O2 has 8 protons each, so molecule has 16 protons. Neutrons per O is 8, so total neutrons would be 16 as well. Oh wait, but the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons? No, wait, each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the molecule would have same number of protons and neutrons. That's possible. Alternatively, could it be something like N2? N has 7 protons each, so N2 has 14 protons. Neutrons per N is 7 (for N-14), so total neutrons 14. So yes, same number. So W could be N2 or O2 or another diatomic like that.

Alternatively, maybe W is a molecule like CO or something else. Wait, CO has 12 + 15 = 27 protons. Neutrons would be
