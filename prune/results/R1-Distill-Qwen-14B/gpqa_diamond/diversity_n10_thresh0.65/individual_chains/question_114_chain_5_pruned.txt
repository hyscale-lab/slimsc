Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let's see what the reactions are about.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid, specifically 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually a nucleophilic substitution. Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, the reaction of a ketone with a cyanide ion (like from NaCN) typically forms a cyanohydrin, which has both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN would form a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the CN adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an OH group. So the product would have OH and CN on the same carbon, which is the second carbon (since butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO). So the product structure is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile would have four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. Oh wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. The ketone is (CH3)
