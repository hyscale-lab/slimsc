Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, let's see what information I've got. The production energy is 8 GeV, the mass is 1.2 GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay distances are usually really tiny because they're so short-lived. But how do I calculate the mean decay distance?

I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the relation between distance and lifetime is speed multiplied by lifetime. So, d = v * τ. But wait, I don't have the velocity or the lifetime directly. Hmm, what else do I know?

Oh, the particle's energy and mass can help find its velocity. The energy E is the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, which is higher than the rest mass of 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving relativistically.

The relation between energy, mass, and momentum is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Wait, but in this case, the units might be tricky because the energies are given in GeV and mass in GeV/c². Let me think about the units. Oh, right, since E is often given in GeV, and mass m is in GeV/c², so to make the equation work, maybe I can express everything in terms of natural units where c=1. Because in particle physics, they often use natural units where c is 1, simplifying equations.

So, using E² = p² + m². That should be the correct formula in natural units. So, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Let me compute p, the momentum.

Calculating p: p² = E² - m² = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p is sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV. Wait, 7.91 approximately.

Now, the velocity can be found from the relation p
