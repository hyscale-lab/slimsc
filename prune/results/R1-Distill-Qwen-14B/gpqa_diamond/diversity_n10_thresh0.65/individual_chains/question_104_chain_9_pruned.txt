Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that movement through shifts in the wavelengths of its spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV shifts detected are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, what determines the RV shift? I think the RV signal (the semi-amplitude) depends on several factors. I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ), but M_p is much smaller than M_star, so that term can be approximated. Wait, more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / c

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / c.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the RV shift and the orbital period. Because the problem gives the RV shifts and asks about the ratio of the periods.

Another approach: The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is inversely related to the orbital period. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the Doppler formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) ) * (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) 

But since M_p is much less than M_star,
