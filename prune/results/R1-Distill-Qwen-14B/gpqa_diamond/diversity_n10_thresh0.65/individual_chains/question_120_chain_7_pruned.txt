Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being a different power of 1/plx.

Hmm, let me think. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. I remember that the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So as plx increases, the distance decreases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean their distances are uniformly spread out, or their positions in the sky (solid angle) are uniform? Probably the latter, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's about the number density in 3D space. Hmm, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that would mean the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

But parallax relates to distance, so to find the number of stars in a certain range of parallax, I need to relate that to the volume. Let me think about this. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density (since volume is 4πd² dr, and number density is stars per unit volume).

Wait, but parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So let's express everything in terms of plx. The volume of a thin shell at d is 4π d² dr. But dr is the thickness in distance. Since plx is 1/d, a change in plx dplx would correspond to a change in d. Let's compute dr in terms of dplx.

dplx = - (1/d²) dd. Oh wait, because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dr (small change in d) is - (dplx)/ (plx)^2.

But when considering a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, I think I should be looking at the volume in terms of plx. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider how many stars are there per unit of plx.

Wait, the number of stars in a range of plx would depend on the volume of space corresponding to that range. So for a given plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx. The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr would be N = n * 4π d² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But dr is a function of dplx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, dr = (d (plx)) = derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me compute that.

dr/dplx = d/d (1/plx) → since d = 1/plx, then dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr = - dplx / (plx²). But since dplx is a small increment, we can ignore the negative sign for the purpose of counting the number of stars (since plx decreases as d increases, but we're considering a positive dplx).

So the volume for a thin shell is 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx^2) )= 4π d^2 dr = 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx/plx^2) ) = 4π (d^2 / plx^4) dplx )

Wait, but wait. Another approach: since the number of stars is n * volume, and volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the differential number of stars as a function of plx.

Let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of the shell at distance d = 1/plx with thickness dr. So the volume is 4π d² dr.

But since dr = (d dplx)/ (d plx). Wait, plx is 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Therefore, dd = - d plx * d². So dr = -d² d plx.

But since d plx is a small positive increment, dr would be negative if d plx is positive, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps we should take the absolute value. So the thickness dr is |dd| = d² d plx.

So the volume element is 4π d² dr = 4π d² (d² d plx) ) = 4π d^4 d plx. Since d = 1/plx, substitute that in.

d^4 = (1/plx)^4 = 1/plx^4. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in that volume is n
