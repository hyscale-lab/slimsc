Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to find the maximum speed. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Wait, the question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. Relativistic, so I guess we have to consider special relativity effects here. Oh right, that means I can't just use the classical formulas because at high speeds, the relativistic effects become significant.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is v_max = sqrt(kA/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) converts into kinetic energy. So when x = A, all the energy is kinetic, and v is maximum. But wait, the options have some expressions with c and square roots, so relativity is definitely a factor.

But wait, the options also have answers that don't match the classical result. For example, option C is sqrt(kA²/m), which is the same as the classical v_max. So why would that be an option? Maybe because in the relativistic case, the speed can't reach c, so perhaps the maximum speed is lower.

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy would include the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy.
