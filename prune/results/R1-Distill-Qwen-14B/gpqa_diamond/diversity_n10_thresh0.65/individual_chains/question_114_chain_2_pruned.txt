Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations for A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, or (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is OH and CN on the same carbon that was the carbonyl carbon.

So, the reaction looks like a ketone reacting with cyanide. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it might add to the carbonyl, but under what conditions?

Wait, but in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps? Because I think the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, but maybe the reaction needs some activation. Alternatively, I recall that sometimes aq. H+ is used as a catalyst in such additions.

Wait, another thought: butan-2-one has a ketone group. Adding NaCN (which provides CN-) in acidic conditions. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN-, but in what solvent? Or maybe it's in water? Or perhaps it's in a protic solvent.

Wait, another thing: the product has both hydroxyl and nitrile groups. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the starting ketone (CH3)2CO becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

So, how does that happen? So the ketone is reacting with CN-? Maybe through a substitution, but wait, ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, perhaps it's a addition-elimination mechanism. Let me think.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone, followed by some protonation and elimination. Oh wait, that might lead to a substitution.

Wait, another idea: the first reaction could be the formation of a cyanohydrin. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The acid helps protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So, in this case, the reagent A is the acid catalyst. But what's the source of that? NaCN is providing the cyanide, but the acid would be a separate reagent. So, if A is H3O+ (i.e., HCl, H2SO4,
