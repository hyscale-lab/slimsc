Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to an observer. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative motion and light, I have to think about how different frames of reference affect measurements. Let me try to break this down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer in the lab. And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is the ratio of c to the speed of light in the medium. So in the glass, light goes at v = 1/n.

But now, the glass is moving. So I think this is a case where we have to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly. So the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, c is 1, so that simplifies things.

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is u = 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, what is the observed speed of the light?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards him, but the light is also moving in the same direction. That's a bit confusing. Let me visualize it.

Imagine the lab frame where the observer is stationary. The glass is moving towards the observer, say from right to left, but the light inside the glass is moving towards the left as well, because the beam is propagating through the glass in that direction. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, so the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer
