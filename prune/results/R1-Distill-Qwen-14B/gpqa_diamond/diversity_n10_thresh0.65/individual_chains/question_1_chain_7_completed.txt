Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find out which energy difference allows them to be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with energy and lifetime. Oh right! The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, or something like that.

Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Hmm, which is it? I think it's ħ/(2π) because that's what I remember from the textbooks. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, right?

So, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. Each state has its own lifetime. But wait, how does that relate to the energy difference between them? Because if the energy levels are too close, the uncertainty from their lifetimes might blur them together, making it hard to distinguish between E1 and E2.

Wait, maybe the idea is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if E2 - E1 is larger than the uncertainty, then they can be distinguished in a measurement. So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ/(2Δt). So, for state 1 with Δt1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2*Δt1). Similarly for state 2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2*Δt2).

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or the maximum of the two? Or maybe each of their individual uncertainties?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the line broadening. Each state has a natural linewidth (the uncertainty in energy) determined by its lifetime. The energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual linewidths to be resolved. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the lines might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

Wait, let's get back to the formula. The uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). So for the first state with Δt1=1e-9 s, ΔE1= ħ/(2e-9). Similarly, for Δt2=1e-8 s, ΔE2= ħ/(2e-8). 

Calculating these values numerically could help. Knowing that ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Let me plug in the numbers.

For ΔE1: 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = approximately 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9 is 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-16+9 = 3.291e-7 eV. So, about 3.29e-7 eV.

For ΔE2: 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, that seems way too small. Wait, no, because 1e-8 is bigger than 1e-9, so the denominator is bigger, so ΔE2 is smaller. So, the first state has a larger uncertainty in energy.

So for E1, the uncertainty is ~3.29e-7 eV, and E2's uncertainty is ~3.29e-8 eV.

So, for the energy difference between E1 and E2, to be clearly distinguished, it must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, their energy levels might overlap in the measurements.

Wait, but I've heard that the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty (like the maximum of the two uncertainties). Or perhaps the sum? Hmm, not sure. Let me think: if E2 - E1 is larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, then it's definitely distinguishable. But if it's larger than the sum, then that's even better. Because if the difference is larger than either, then the lines don't overlap. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because otherwise, depending on the positions, they might still overlap.

Wait, perhaps an example: suppose E1 has a width of 3e-7 eV and E2 has 3e-8 eV. If E2 is higher than E1 by, say, 3e-7 eV, that's equal to E1's uncertainty. So, the E2's line is just at the edge of E1's uncertainty. That might not be clearly distinguishable. So, maybe the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. So, 3e-7 + 3e-8 = 3.3e-7 eV. So, the energy difference must be larger than about 3.3e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's way smaller than 3e-7. Can't be.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Also way too small.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 3.3e-7 eV. So that's acceptable.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. But 3.3e-7 is 0.00000033. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.3e-7, so it's not enough.

So, the only option that's larger than about 3.3e-7 eV is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the numbers more accurately. Let me calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) = (6.582e-16 eV s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.

So, the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is 3.29e-7 eV. The sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So, for the energy difference to be clearly distinguishable, it has to be larger than this sum, or perhaps just larger than the maximum. Hmm, but in practice, the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Because if it's larger than the maximum, then the two states won't overlap in their energy distributions.

Wait, if E2 - E1 is greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2, then even considering both uncertainties, the energy levels don't overlap. But if it's just larger than the maximum, then it's sufficient because the regions of uncertainty don't overlap. So, perhaps the condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if E2-E1 is larger than ΔE1, then E2's lower edge (E2 - ΔE2) is above E1's upper edge (E1 + ΔE1). So, that would require E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2. So the sum is the condition.

Wait, let's think. Imagine E1 is at some energy, and E2 is higher. The uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 above and below. Similarly, E2's uncertainty is ΔE2. So, to prevent overlap, the lowest E2 can be (E2 - ΔE2) must be above the highest E1 can be (E1 + ΔE1). So,

E2 - ΔE2 > E1 + ΔE1

Which simplifies to E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

So, the required ΔE is greater than (3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8) eV ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, none of them state that. The options are A:1e-9, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is way larger. So that would satisfy the condition.

So, the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)):

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties for each state
- For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for distinguishability
To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). It satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to be clearly distinguishable is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
