Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with atoms in stars, the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) applies. That means the gas in the photosphere behaves according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for energy levels.

The question states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I'm trying to remember the formula that relates the population of energy levels to temperature.

Oh right, the Boltzmann equation! The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant. The equation is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, I think E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive.

In this case, the excited state is higher in energy. So if the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, that means the population of the higher energy level (n2) compared to the lower one (n1) is 2 times higher in star_1 than in star_2. Or wait, actually, the problem says the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

Wait, it says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Oh, I think that refers to the ratio of the excited level to the ground level. So, for star_1, n2/n1 is 2 times that of star_2. Wait, no, actually, the problem says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, perhaps it's that the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So, n2/n1 for star_1 is 2 * (n2/n1 for star_2).

Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2? Or perhaps the ratio of excited to ground is 2 in star_1 compared to, say, 1 in star_2. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Let me denote the ratio as
