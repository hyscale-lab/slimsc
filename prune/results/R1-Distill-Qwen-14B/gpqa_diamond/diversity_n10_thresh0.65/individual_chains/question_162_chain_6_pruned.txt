Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, what's the metric given here? Let me look again.

The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh right, so this is in two dimensions, probably a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but for calculating area, the embedding might not matter as much as the metric itself.

Wait, area of a pseudosphere. I think the area formula for a surface in 2D with metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²) is the double integral of sqrt(g) dxdy. But in this case, the metric is conformally flat, so the area element is just sqrt(g) dx dy. So the area should be the integral over the appropriate region of sqrt(g) dx dy.

What's g here? The metric coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is just g itself because it's diagonal and same coefficients. So the area element is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. But wait, actually, no. Because for a metric in the form ds² = E(dx² + dy²), the area element is sqrt(E) dx dy. So here, E is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the area element is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but sqrt(32) is 4√2. So the area element is 4√2 / sqrt
