Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I've heard that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, some reactions happen. 

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution changes the concentration. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, I need to find the pH at two specific points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The options are A to D, so I need to calculate both pH values and match them to the options.

First, let's think about the initial solution. Diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The new concentration can be found using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 V1) / V2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. To find the equivalence point, I need to calculate how much NaOH is needed to neutralize all the acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's find the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Let's calculate the amounts.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles reacted: 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution now is initial volume (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.736.

Wait, wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). So let me calculate that. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → no, wait, log(1.85e-5) is negative. So pKa is -log(1.85e-5).

Let me compute that. Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.01764
