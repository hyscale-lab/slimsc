Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transiting exoplanets are detected when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of such an event depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_1's period is shorter, that means it's orbiting closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. Shorter period means closer orbit.

The host stars have different masses but same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So, let's think about the relation between star mass and planet's distance. Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed over the star's mass. So for Planet_1, since the period is shorter (P1 = P2 /3), and the star is more massive (M1 = 2*M2), how does that affect the semi-major axis?

Wait, Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So P² ∝ a³ / M. So rearranged, a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So for a given star (M) and period (P), the semi-major axis a would be determined.

But in this case, Planet_1 has P1 = P2/3, and M1 = 2*M2. Let's say Planet_2's period is P. So Planet_1's period is P/3.

So for the semi-major axis of Planet_1 (a1) and Planet_2 (a2):

a1³ / a2³ = (M2 / M1) * (P1² / P2²)
Since M1 = 2*M2, M2/M1 = 1/2.
P1² = (P/3)² = P²/9.
P1²/P2² = (P²/9)/(P²) ) = 1/9.

So a1³/a2³ = (1/2) * (1/9) = 1/18. So a1 = a2 * (1/18)^(1/3). Let's compute 1/18^(1/3
