Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky, but let's take it step by step. I'll try to break it down and figure it out.

First, let's look at the question. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a good starting point. The reagents it's reacted with are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. I think I remember that these reagents are often involved in diazotization and some kind of reaction after that, maybe a hydrolysis or something else.

The NMR data is provided. Let me jot that down:

- 9.72 ppm: triplet, 1H
- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H
- 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H
- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H

I need to figure out the structure based on this. Let me think about the possible functional groups. The molecular formula has an N, so maybe an amine or something else. But wait, the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which I think is used for diazotization. Diazotization typically occurs with aromatic amines, like aniline derivatives, under cold conditions. So maybe the compound has an aromatic amine?

Wait, the NMR has a triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the first thing is that after reaction with NaNO2 and HCl, which would be diazotization, followed by H2O, maybe a hydrolysis. Then aqueous KOH and heat, perhaps a dehydration or elimination?

Alternatively, maybe the initial compound has a nitro group? But I'm not sure. Let me think. The NMR has a triplet at 9.72. If it's an aldehyde, that would make sense. But wait, when you have an aromatic ring with substituents, the coupling can give certain patterns.

Looking at the aromatic region:

- 6.98: doublet (2H)
- 6.51: doublet (2H)
- 6.27: broad singlet (2H)

Hmm, the 6.98 and 6.51
