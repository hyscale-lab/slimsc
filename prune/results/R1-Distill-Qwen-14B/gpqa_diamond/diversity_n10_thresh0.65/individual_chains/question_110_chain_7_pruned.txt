Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different capabilities. Let me break down the question.

The question mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must have an apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16 for HIRES to see it, and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no—actually, the wording says 'brighter than 17 mag' for ESPRESSO. Oh wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag (like 16 or lower), ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can handle stars up to 16 mag, so anything brighter than 16 (i.e., magnitude <16) can be detected by HIRES.

Wait, let me clarify. The question states: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So that means V magnitude less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V magnitude less than 16. So a star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, if the V magnitude is brighter (lower number), then the condition is that the star's V must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. So a star must have V mag ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and V mag ≤16 to be seen by HIRES.

Wait no, actually, the way it's phrased is: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter (i.e., has a lower magnitude number), it's acceptable. So the maximum V mag is 17. So any star with V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V ≤16.

So to be detectable by both, a star must have V ≤16 because that's the stricter condition. Because ESPRESS
