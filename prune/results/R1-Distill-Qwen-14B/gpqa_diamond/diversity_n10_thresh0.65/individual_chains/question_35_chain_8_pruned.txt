Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices or something like that. Let me think.

The question says that the Y-component of the angular momentum, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), right? And S has the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I've seen similar matrices before, probably related to spin operators.

Wait, the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The S matrix here looks like σy, because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S = σy. Then, A_y would be (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

Eigenvalues are found by solving det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. Let's write out A_y:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, A_y - a I = [[-a, -(h/(4π)) i], [(h/(4π)) i, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (h/(4π))^2 (i)(-i) ) ] = a² - [ (h²/(16π²)) * (i)(-i) ) ]

Wait, i * (-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (h²/(16π²)) * 1 = 0.

So equation: a² - (h²/(16π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, that can't be right. Because solving for a in det(A_y - a I) gives us a squared equals (h/(4π))^2 times (1), because the determinant calculation leads to a^2 - (h/(4π))^2 * (i)(-i) ) → a^2 - (h/(4π))^2*(1) =0.

So a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π).
