Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The formula I think is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance. So plx = 1/d, which means that as the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution usually means the same number per unit volume. So if they're uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. But how does that translate to the number per unit parallax?

Parallax and distance are inversely related. So let's think about the volume of space at a certain distance. For a thin shell at distance d, the volume would be 4πd² * thickness, right? Because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area times thickness. Surface area is 4πr² for radius r, which here is distance d.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I need to think in terms of plx, not distance. Since plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/(plx)^2) * thickness. Because d squared is (1/plx)^2.

Now, how does the number of stars in that shell depend on parallax? Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a shell should be proportional to the volume of the shell. And the thickness is a small change in distance, which would correspond to a change in parallax. Let me think about the differential here.

Let’s say we take a small range in parallax, d(plx). How does that relate to the change in distance, d(d)? Since plx = 1/d, taking derivatives, d(plx) = - (1/d²) d(d). Hmm, so d(d) = -d² d(plx).

The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness d(d) is proportional to the volume, which is 4πd² * d(d). Substituting d(d) from earlier, that becomes 4πd² * (-d² d(plx)). Wait, but the minus sign here is just about the direction, but since we're dealing with absolute numbers, we can ignore the sign. So the number of stars is proportional to 4π d^4 d(plx). But since d = 1/plx, d^4 is (1/plx)^4. So
