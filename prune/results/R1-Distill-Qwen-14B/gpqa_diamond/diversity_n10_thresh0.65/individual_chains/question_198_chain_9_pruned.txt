Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's read it again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]?) among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how much a complex is formed. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So, the higher beta means the complex is more likely to form.

Each β corresponds to a different complex. Let's list them out:

- β1 = 9: likely the simplest complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+
- β2 = 40: next complex, perhaps [Co(SCN)_2]^2+
- β3 = 63: another complex, maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^-
- β4 =16: wait, 16 is less than β3 and β2. That's a bit confusing. So, the complexes might not necessarily be in order of increasing n. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. The stability constants usually go in order of the number of ligand added. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^− (n=3), and [Co(SCN)_4]^3− (n=4). Oh wait, but the beta4 is 16, which is less than β3 (63). That's odd because usually, higher complexes have higher stability constants, but maybe not always. So the complexes' stabilities vary.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm not exactly sure which complex is blue. I think in the case of Co(II), the [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is blue, but wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is the blue one. Wait, I remember that the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion is pink, and when SCN- replaces water, the color changes. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is usually a deep blue color. So if the question refers to dithiocyanato, that might be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which is a different structure. Or perhaps it's the tetraammine dithiocyanato? Hmm, I might be confused here.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem refers to 'dithiocyanato' complexes, which implies two SCN- ligands. So probably the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So for n=2, that's the complex with β2=40.

So the question is asking for the percentage of Co in this [Co(SCN)_2]^2
