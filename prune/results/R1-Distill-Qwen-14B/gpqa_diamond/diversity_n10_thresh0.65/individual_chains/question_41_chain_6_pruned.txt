Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. 

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the beam is going through the glass, which is itself moving. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the speed of light observed in that medium from another frame.

Oh right, I think this involves some relativity, but wait, relativity usually comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. But maybe the problem is assuming classical mechanics here, given that it's an introductory question. Or perhaps it's using the relativistic Doppler effect? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, no. The question is about the speed of light in the glass, not the frequency or wavelength. Oh, right, the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, velocities just add up. Like, if the medium is moving at velocity u, and light is moving at velocity v in that medium, then the observed velocity in the lab frame would be u + v. But wait, does that apply here?

Wait, no, that can't be right because light's speed isn't simply additive. Oh right,
