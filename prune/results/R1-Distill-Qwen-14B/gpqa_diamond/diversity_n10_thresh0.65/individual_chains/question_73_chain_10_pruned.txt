Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned about relativity. The question is asking about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. 

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction. So both are moving in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when dealing with relativity, especially velocities, I can't just subtract the speeds normally because of the relativistic effects. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is needed here.

So for the relative speed, I think the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2*v1)/c²). But wait, wait. Because if they're moving in the same direction, like both positive, then the relative speed would be v2 - v1 divided by the denominator. Let me make sure. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Or wait, no, the question says the relative speed between them, so since both are moving in the same direction, it should be the difference in their speeds. But relativistically, it's not that simple. 

Wait, wait a second. Let me think. The velocity of B relative to A would be (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)). Because from A's frame, B is approaching at a lower speed. So v_A is 0.6c, v_B is
