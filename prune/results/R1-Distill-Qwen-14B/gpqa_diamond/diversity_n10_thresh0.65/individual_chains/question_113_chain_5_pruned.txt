Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown organic compound based on various spectroscopic data. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The compound has been characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but sometimes alcohols have broad peaks because they can form hydrogen bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group in something else.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, what functional groups show up there? I know that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) typically absorb around 1700. The peak at 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, or maybe an amide, but I don't think amides are in the options here. Or perhaps another carbonyl? Wait, maybe an ester, where the carbonyl is a bit lower than a ketone? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester, which might have a lower wavenumber.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those in double bonds, so that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene. So the structure probably includes an alkene group. Also, the presence of multiple peaks suggests possible substituents around the double bond, maybe an aromatic ring or another group.

The mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what could give a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (43), but wait, 45 is a bit higher. Maybe it's (CH2)2O? No, that's 46. Wait, maybe something like C3H7O? Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, could it be a ketene ion or something else? Or perhaps a methoxy group (OCH3) is 31,
