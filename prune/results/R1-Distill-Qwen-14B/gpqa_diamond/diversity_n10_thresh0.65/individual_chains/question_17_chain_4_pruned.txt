Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The K here is the formation constant, right? So the complex is CaEDTA^2-, and the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. If the complex dissociates, it should release Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But because the K is so large (5e10), which is a big number, that suggests the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the amount of Ca²+ should be small.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the formation constant K is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So when K is large, it means the complex is favored, so the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution should be low.

But the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So if the complex is Ca-EDTA, and the solution is 0.02 M of that, then the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think. When you have a complex like this, the total concentration is the sum of the complex and the free ions. But in this case, the solution is made by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, before any dissociation, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But that's not possible because the complex will dissociate a little.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the complex is already formed. So the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-. The complex will dissociate a bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and at equilibrium, some x amount dissociates. So the changes would be:

CaEDTA^2-: 0.02 - x
Ca²+: x
EDTA^4-: x

So the expression for K would be K = (0.02 - x)/(x * x) = (0.02 - x)/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, but wait a second. Since K is so large, 5e10, the denominator (x²) must be very small, meaning x is very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation simplifies to approximately 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x: x
