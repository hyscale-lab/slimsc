Okay, so I've got this physics question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, maybe it's ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact inequality.

So, the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ. Since the lifetimes of the states are given, I think Δt would be the lifetime of each state. But wait, which lifetime do I use? Or does each state have its own uncertainty?

Wait, no. The question is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So I think the key here is the energy resolution. The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for the system to distinguish them. So, each state's lifetime would contribute to the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, maybe each state has its own uncertainty. But how does that affect the energy difference between them? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for the system to resolve them. The larger the energy difference, the easier it is to tell them apart.

But how do the lifetimes relate to the
