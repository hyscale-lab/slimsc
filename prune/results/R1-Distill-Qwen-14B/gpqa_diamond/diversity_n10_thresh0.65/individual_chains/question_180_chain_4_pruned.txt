Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. The particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. I think that relates to the electric potential energy because when you bring charges together, their potential energy changes. 

Wait, but since all the charges are the same, they'll either all be positive or all negative. Since each is 2e, if e is positive (like the proton charge), then each charge is positive. So like charges repel, so bringing them together would require work, increasing the potential energy. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Hmm, but wait, if the charges are fixed in place, maybe we're just calculating the potential energy of the configuration as it is. 

So I think the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. The formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r. Since all the charges are the same, q1 and q2 are both 2e each.
