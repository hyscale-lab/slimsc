Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's see, the question gives me four matrices W, X, Y, Z and four options A to D. I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices are used a lot, especially for operators and states.

First, I need to recall some concepts. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which corresponds to measurable quantities. The evolution operator, which is the time evolution operator, is unitary. So, if a matrix is unitary, it can be an evolution operator. Also, the exponential of a matrix (like e^X) can sometimes result in a unitary matrix if X is skew-Hermitian, because e^{iH} is unitary if H is Hermitian.

Looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The norm change implies whether e^X is unitary. If e^X is unitary, then multiplying by it preserves the norm of vectors. So if e^X is not unitary, then there exists a vector where the norm changes. So I need to check if e^X is unitary.

Wait, e^X is unitary if X is skew-Hermitian. Because for a skew-Hermitian matrix X, X† = -X. Then, e^{iX} is unitary. But in this case, the question is about e^X, not e^{iX}. So if X is Hermitian, then e^X is not necessarily unitary. Wait, no, actually, e^{iX} would be unitary when X is Hermitian. But e^X itself, if X is Hermitian, would have eigenvalues positive, but not necessarily unitary.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a matrix U to be unitary, U U† = I. So e^X is unitary only if X is skew-Hermitian. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Because if X is skew-Hermitian, X† = -X, then (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^{-X} = inverse of e^X, so e^X is unitary.

So for option A, if e^X is not unitary, then it changes the norm of some vector. So I need to check if X is skew
