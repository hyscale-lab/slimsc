Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, they're looking at the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. I think I remember that in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy states based on their temperature. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower. So, without spots, Teff is higher (6000 K), and with 40% spots, it's 5500 K.

The ratio n1/n2 (since the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2) would depend on the temperature. Let me clarify: the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2. So according to Boltzmann, higher energy levels have fewer atoms, especially when T is lower.

Wait, but the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Because if E2 > E1, then higher T would make the exponent less negative, so the ratio would be larger. So higher T would lead to higher n1/n2 ratio.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of atoms in level 2 is n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So n1/n2 = [g1/(g2)] * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if E2 > E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So as T increases, (E2-E1)/(kT) decreases. So exp of that is larger when T is lower. Wait, no, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) is larger when T is smaller. So when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so the exp term becomes larger, but wait, actually (E2-E1)/(kT) is a positive number, so when T is higher, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller. So exp of a smaller positive number is a larger value. No, wait, exp(x) increases as x increases. So for a fixed (E2-E1
