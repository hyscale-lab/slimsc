Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the reactions are.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents for A and B.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it usually undergoes nucleophilic addition. So the first step is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl group.

But wait, in the product, there's a hydroxy group. So maybe after the addition of CN, something else happens. Oh! I think when you add CN- to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. So the reaction is adding HCN (from NaCN and H+) across the carbonyl.

But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but in solution, you need a proton source to generate HCN. So the reagent A might be an acid, like H3
