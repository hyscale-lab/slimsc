Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. So the metric looks like it's in terms of x and y, but I'm not sure if it's in 2D or higher dimensions. Oh, wait, the options involve pi, which makes me think of area in 2D, maybe a sphere-like surface.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right! A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its area is finite but it's not compact. But wait, how does that relate to the metric?

I remember that in differential geometry, the area element in a 2D metric is given by sqrt(g_xy) dx dy, where g_xy is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, the metric here is given in a way that's already multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Let me write the metric more clearly.

The metric can be written as ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j. Here, g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms (g_{xy} and g_{yx}) are zero. So the metric tensor is diagonal with each component equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The determinant of the metric, g, is (32/(4 - x² - y²))², because for a diagonal metric, the
