Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember from my solid state chemistry class that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the unit cell parameters.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... Oh right, a rhombohedron has all edges equal and all angles equal. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same too. In this question, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, but wait, wait—interatomic distance in a rhombohedral structure is a bit more complex. Or is it the lattice parameter? Because for a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is just 'a', but rhombohedral is more complicated.

Wait no, the interatomic distance would be the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. If it's a primitive rhombohedral lattice, each atom is at the corners, so the distance between two adjacent atoms would be the edge length of the rhombohedron. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So I think a, the edge length, is 10 Angstroms. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', so same here, probably. So a = 10.

The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So the crystal is a rhombohedron with a = 10 Å and each angle 30°. Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111
