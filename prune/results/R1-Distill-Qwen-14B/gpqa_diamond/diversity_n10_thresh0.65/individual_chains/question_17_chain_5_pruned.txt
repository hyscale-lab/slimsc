Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably a 1:1 ratio since it's stochiometric. So, the complex is CaEDTA²-.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because once the complex forms, the calcium isn't free anymore, right?

So, I think this is a problem about the dissociation of the complex. The K value given (5x10^10) is the formation constant, Kf. The formation constant tells us how much the complex forms from its ions. The higher the K, the more stable the complex.

Wait, but wait. The formation constant Kf is usually the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−

And Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But if we're looking for the concentration of Ca²+ in solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex. Because the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the K for dissociation would be the inverse of Kf. So, if Kf is 5e10, the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/(5e10), which is a very small number, 2e-11. So, the dissociation doesn't happen much, meaning the complex is very stable, so [Ca²+] should be very low.

So, the situation is that we start with 0.02 M CaEDTA^2−. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02
