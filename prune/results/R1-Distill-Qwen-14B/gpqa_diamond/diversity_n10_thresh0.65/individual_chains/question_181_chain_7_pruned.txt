Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I need to figure out the ratio between two energy bands. Hmm, let's think.

So, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core reactions are involved here. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions leading to helium production, and the different branches (like pp-I, pp-II, pp-III) are different pathways in that chain.

But what's pp-III? I think pp-III is one of the later steps. Oh right, the pp chain starts with two protons (which are actually protons, but in the sun they are actually fusion of hydrogen into helium). The pp-I branch might produce deuterium, and then pp-II could involve another step, and pp-III would be the final step where two deuterons combine into helium-4. Wait no, maybe pp-III is a different pathway. Alternatively, I think that the pp chain has different branches, but the main one is the pp-I leading up to the triple-alpha process or something else. Wait, perhaps I should check my understanding.

Wait, the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which is the dominant fusion process in the Sun. It starts with two protons fusing to form deuterium, then deuterium fusing with another proton to form helium-3. Then, these helium-3 nuclei can either combine (pp-II and pp-III branches) or undergo other reactions.

Ah right, so the pp-I branch is where two helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4, releasing two protons. The pp-II branch is where a helium-3 nucleus captures an electron and becomes a helium-4 nucleus, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The pp-III branch is where a helium-3 nucleus fuses with a helium-4 nucleus, producing carbon-12 and a couple of protons. Wait, no, maybe that's part of the CNO cycle? Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The main pp-I branch is the most common, producing two helium-3 nuclei that then combine into helium-4. The other branches (like pp-II and pp-III) are minor. So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III branch might be a minor contributor, so stopping it would reduce the number of certain neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the CNO cycle, but wait, no. Wait, solar neutrinos come from different sources. The primary source is the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-I branch, which doesn't directly produce neutrinos. Oh wait, no, in the pp chain, neutrinos are produced in the pp-II branch. Because during the pp-II process, when a helium-3 captures a proton to
