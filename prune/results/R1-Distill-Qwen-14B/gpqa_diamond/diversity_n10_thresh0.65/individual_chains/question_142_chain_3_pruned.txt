Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But where is this particular one located geometrically in the qubit space?

I think qubit space is often represented on the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. So a density matrix that's a mixture of |0> and |1> might be somewhere on the Bloch sphere.

Let me recall the Bloch representation. For a single qubit, any state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix ρ can be expressed in terms of r and the Pauli matrices.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, I think |0><0| is the outer product, which gives a matrix with 1 in the top left, and |1><1| has 1 in the bottom right. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. So ρ is (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

Wait, but the identity matrix in terms of the Bloch sphere... Because ρ = I/2. Let me think: in the Bloch representation, the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is I/2, then that would mean that r·σ is zero. So r must be the zero vector. Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2.

So the vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the state at the origin, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state. If I remember correctly, the maximally mixed state is represented at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. So this would correspond to option C, which is r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is indeed (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.
