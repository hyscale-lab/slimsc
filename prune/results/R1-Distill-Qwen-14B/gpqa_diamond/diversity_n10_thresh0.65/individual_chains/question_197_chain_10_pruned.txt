Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The data given are the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range. This usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): That's a strong downfield shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons usually are around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid? But wait, in carboxylic acids, the proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 2500-3000 that's typical for an O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but wait, the IR has 3400-2500, which is a broad range — maybe it's an aldehyde or a phenol, but phenols usually show a broad peak around 5-7 ppm in NMR, which doesn't fit this 10.5. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde and another group. Wait, but aldehyde protons are around 9-10, so 10.5 is a bit upfield but possible. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Aldehydes have higher carbonyl frequencies, around 1720-1740, so that fits. So maybe an aldehyde group is present.

But wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm could be an acidic proton, like from a benzylic position or something else. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde. Let's keep that in mind.

Next NMR signals:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para to
