Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. 

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's something really tiny but not as small as atomic scales.

Wait, decay distance... Oh right, particles that are unstable decay over time, and the mean decay length is how far they travel before decaying. For relativistic particles, the decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (proper time) multiplied by the gamma factor (Lorentz factor) from their velocity.

So the formula should be something like L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.

But wait, we don't have the velocity or the lifetime directly. So I need to find the lifetime first. I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle tells us that Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Specifically, Γ = ħ / tau, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, no, more accurately, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty in the decay process. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for the lifetime τ, which is the average proper lifetime, we have τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the proper lifetime is tau = ħ / (Γ c^2), because Γ has units of energy. Let me check the units. Γ is in GeV, ħ is in GeV·s (since E=ħν, so ħ has the same units as E times time). So tau would be (ħ * s) / GeV ) * (1/GeV) ) → s. Oh wait, let me calculate.

So, let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the proper lifetime tau (tau_0) using tau_0 = ħ / (Γ c^2). Wait, because Γ is the width, which is energy. So
