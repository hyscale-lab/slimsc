Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, okay, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines to detect planets. The shift indicates the star's movement due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key difference here is the periodic wavelength shifts: Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, how does the RV method relate the shift to the planet's orbital period and other parameters? Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. But since the star's mass is the same for both (solar mass), and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much smaller than Jupiter, but similar in this case.

The formula I recall is the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (c * (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the simplified version when M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is the case here. So M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

Then K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3))) )^(1/ )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift (or the velocity semi-amplitude K) is related to the mass of the planet, the period, and the star's mass. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, the denominator's (1 + M_p/M_*) can be approximated as 1. So:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But since both stars have the same mass M_* (same as Sun) and both planets have similar masses (M_p is same for both), the ratio of K1 and K2 would depend on the periods.

Wait, but the question says the RV shifts are different. Let me think. The actual shift in wavelength is related to the velocity via the Doppler effect.

The Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ = v / c

So v = c * (Δλ / λ)

But in this problem, the shifts are given in milliangstroms. Wait, but the actual wavelength probably doesn't
