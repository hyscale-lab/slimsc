Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like radial velocity measurements. But the key here is the apparent magnitude each can observe. The question states that ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 V mag, while HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So, the limiting factor is the fainter magnitude each can detect.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, the problem says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, magnitude works such that lower numbers are brighter. So, a limit of brighter than 17 means they can see stars that are 17 or brighter, which is fainter than higher magnitudes. Or wait, no. Oh right, high magnitude means fainter. So, if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can see stars down to magnitude 17 and brighter (so up to lower numbers). But for a star to be detectable, its apparent magnitude should be less than or equal to the limit. So, for example, a star with apparent magnitude 16 would be brighter than 17, so it's detectable by ESPRESSO, which has a limit of 17.

Wait, perhaps another way to think: the V magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. The lower (smaller) the V magnitude, the brighter the star. So a star with V=10 is brighter than V=15. So the question says: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So that would mean stars with V < 17 can be observed. Because if a star has V=16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so stars with V <=16.

So the ESPRESSO limit is V <=17, and HIRES limit is V <=16. So a star must be brighter than 17 mag (so V less than or equal to 17) to be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 1
