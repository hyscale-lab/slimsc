Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's see what each reaction is doing.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. So, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with CN-, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. So, the ketone would react with the cyanide ion in a nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction. But wait, what are the conditions for that?

Wait, butan-2-one plus NaCN with reagent A gives a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The carbon chain would be four carbons, with a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CN. Wait, no, butanenitrile would be four carbons with the nitrile group on carbon 1. So butan-2-nitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, butanenitrile has four carbons, so numbering from the nitrile end: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So it's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile would have four carbons, so the product is probably (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the name given is butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Well, perhaps the exact structure isn't as important
