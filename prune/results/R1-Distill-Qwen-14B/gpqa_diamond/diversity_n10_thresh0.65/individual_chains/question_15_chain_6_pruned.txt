Okay, so I've got this question about planets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. Oh wait, both have the same mass. Interesting. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since the orbital period is shorter.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have same radii. Wait, same radius? So even though one is more massive, their sizes are the same. Hmm, that's a bit counterintuitive. I thought more massive stars are bigger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but same size. Okay.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is higher when the star is larger because there's a bigger chance the planet's path aligns with our line of sight. Wait, no, actually, the probability is inversely related to the star's size. Wait, no wait, no. The probability is P = (R_planet + R_star) / (a * (
