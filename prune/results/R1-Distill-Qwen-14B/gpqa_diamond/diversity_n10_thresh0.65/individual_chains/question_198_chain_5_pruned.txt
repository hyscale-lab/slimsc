Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

First, I remember that the stability constant (β) indicates how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it shows a greater tendency to form. The complexes here are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ of different orders. The problem mentions dithiocyanato, which I think means two SCN- ligands attached to Co(II). Wait, but wait—Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1, so the number of ligands would determine the charge of the complex. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^2−n. So if n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+ ; n=2 would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0; n=3 would be [Co(SCN)₃]^-; n=4 would be [Co(SCN)₄]^2-.

Wait, but the problem refers to dithiocyanato, which would be n=2, so [Co(SCN)₂] is neutral. But in the options, they're asking about the blue ones. I think the blue ones are the [Co(SCN)₆]^3− complexes, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused with another metal. Alternatively, perhaps the color changes with the number of ligands. I might need to check that, but I think the problem says "blue dithiocyanato" so that's [Co(SCN)₂] or perhaps another form.

Wait, maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)₆]^3−, which is a well-known blue complex. But in this case, the problem states "dithiocyanato" so perhaps it's the n=2 complex. Hmm, that might complicate things. Or perhaps
