Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that relativistic physics comes into play here because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

First, what do I know about the nucleus X? It's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it a 6 nucleon nucleus.

So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6. So the rest mass energy is important here.

The formula for the total energy of a particle in relativity is E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, the question asks for the energy of the RHIC, which is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or is it just the kinetic energy? Or maybe the question refers to the total energy? I need to clarify that.

Wait, wait—the energy provided by the collider is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy because in particle physics, the beam energy is given as the total energy (kinetic plus rest). Or is it the kinetic energy? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, no, I remember that the beam energy (like in colliders) is usually given as the kinetic energy. Wait, no, wait. The total energy is the sum of rest mass and kinetic. So for high-energy particles, the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, but for the calculation, perhaps I should calculate the total energy.

But the problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So it's the total energy because the speed is given, and we can calculate gamma based on that.

So the steps I think are:

1. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me calculate it more precisely.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate it using a calculator approach.

Compute 0.96^2: 0.96 * 0.96. Let me compute 96 * 96. 96² is 9216. So 0.96² is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Square root of 0.0784: Let's think. 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. Because 0.28 * 0.28 = (28/100)*(28/100) = 784/10000 = 0.0784. So yes, the square root is exactly 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. The molar mass of Li is about 6.94 g/mol, but wait, Li-6 is only about 7.59% abundant, but for the purpose of this problem, I think we can just take the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but wait, actually, the mass of a nucleon is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons bound together, so the actual rest mass is a bit less than the sum of individual nucleon masses due to binding energy, but in high-energy physics calculations, sometimes they approximate the mass as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. However, I might be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the nucleus's rest mass is the sum of the individual nucleons, which isn't exactly correct, but for this problem, maybe that's the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 * m_p (proton mass) since a neutron is slightly more massive than a proton. So, m_p is about 938 MeV/c². So each neutron is about 940 MeV/c². So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would be 3*(938) + 3*(940) = let's compute that.

3 *938 = 2814, 3*940=2820. Total is 2814 +2820=5634 MeV. But Li-6 has a binding energy of about 5 MeV (I think), so the actual rest mass is 5634 MeV minus about 5 MeV (because binding energy is negative in mass-energy terms). Wait, but wait, actually, the binding energy is the energy that is released when the nucleus forms, so the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons.

But maybe for this problem, the approximation is to take the rest mass as the sum of the protons and neutrons. Because in high-energy physics, when dealing with heavy ions, sometimes the mass is approximated as A * m_p. So perhaps we can proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is known. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass energy can be calculated using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.014 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 *931.5 = 5589, 0.014 *931.5 = approx 13.041. So total is 5589 +13.041= 5602.041 MeV. So 5602.041 MeV is the rest mass energy.

Wait, but wait, that's the rest energy. So m0 c² is 5602.041 MeV, which is 5.602 GeV.

So m0 c² is approximately 5.602 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c².

So gamma is 3.5714, m0c² is 5.602 GeV.

E = 3.5714 *5.602 GeV.

Compute that: 3 *5.602 =16.806, 0.5714 *5.602.

0.5 *5.602=2.801, 0.0714*5.602≈0.401. So total 2.801+0.401=3.202. So 3.5714 *5.602= 16.806 +3.202≈20.008 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.602:

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.602.

First, 3 *5.602 =16.806.

0.5 *5.602=2.801.

0.07 *5.602=0.39214.

0.0014 *5.602=0.0078428.

Adding up: 2.801 +0.39214=3.19314 +0.0078428=3.20098.

So total is 16.806 +3.20098=20.00698 GeV. Approximately 20.007 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, 20.007 is close to C) 20.132. But perhaps I made a mistake in some step.

Wait, perhaps the gamma calculation was precise and I should recheck.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma. v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28.

Wait, 0.28 is exactly the square root of 0.0784 because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 35/10=3.5, no wait, 35/10 is 3.5. Wait, 3.57142857 is 25/7? Let me check: 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

Yes, 25/7 is 3.57142857.

So gamma is 25/7.

So computing E = (25/7) * m0c².

Now, m0c² for Li-6 is 6.014 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.014 *931.5 = let me compute that precisely.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.014 *931.5 =0.014 *900=12.6, 0.014 *31.5=0.441. So 12.6 +0.441=13.041.

So 5589 +13.041=5602.041 MeV, which is 5.602041 GeV.

So E = (25/7) *5.602041 GeV.

Compute 5.602041 * (25/7) = let's compute 5.602041 * 25 = 140.051025.

Then divide by 7: 140.051025 /7 = 20.007289 GeV.

So approximately 20.007 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6.014 u. Let me check. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 u. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value of 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c².

So m0c² =6.0141 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6.0141 *931.494.

Let me compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.0141 *931.494 = ?

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.0041 *931.494 = approx 3.819.

So 9.31494 +3.819=13.13394.

Total m0c² =5588.964 +13.13394 =5602.09794 MeV.

Which is 5.60209794 GeV.

So E = (25/7) *5.60209794 GeV.

Compute 5.60209794 *25 =140.0524485.

Divide by 7: 140.0524485 /7 =20.00749264 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Hmm, option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's a little higher. Why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the kinetic energy (K) instead of the total energy. Because sometimes, in particle physics, the beam energy refers to the kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So is the energy the kinetic energy or the total energy?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The total energy E is gamma*m c². The kinetic energy K is (gamma -1)*m c².

If the question is asking for the total energy, then 20.007 GeV is the answer. But if it's asking for the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma-1)*5.602 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714, so gamma-1=2.5714. 2.5714 *5.602= let's compute that.

2.5714 *5 =12.857, 2.5714*0.602=approx 1.547. So 12.857 +1.547=14.404 GeV. But the options don't have 14.4 GeV. So perhaps the question refers to the total energy.

So using that, the answer is approximately 20.007 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. But my calculation is 20.007 GeV, which isn't exactly matching any of the options except perhaps none.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, Li-6 has a mass defect. The actual mass is less than the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but in the calculation, I used the atomic mass which accounts for the binding energy. So 6.0141 u is the exact atomic mass. So that should be correct.

Wait, let me re-calculate 25/7 *5.60209794.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

3.5714 *5.60209794.

Let me compute 5.60209794 *3.57142857.

Compute 5.60209794 *3 =16.8062938.

5.60209794 *0.57142857 ≈5.60209794 *0.5=2.80104897, 5.60209794 *0.07142857≈0.4009869.

So 2.80104897 +0.4009869≈3.20203587.

Now, adding 16.8062938 +3.20203587=20.00832967 GeV.

So approximately 20.008 GeV.

Looking at the options, C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so the energy is calculated using the relativistic energy formula, but perhaps the mass used is the rest mass of the nucleus, which is not exactly the sum of the constituent nucleons.

Wait, but I think I used the correct approach with the atomic mass. Let me check the specific numbers.

Wait, what's the exact value of 1 u in MeV/c²? It's approximately 931.494 MeV/c². So 6.0141 u is 6.0141 *931.494 MeV.

Let me compute that accurately:

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.0141 *931.494.

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.0041 *931.494=3.819 (exactly 3.819, since 931.494 *0.004=3.725976, 931.494 *0.0001=0.0931494. So 3.725976 +0.0931494=3.8191254.

So 0.0141 *931.494=9.31494 +3.8191254=13.1340654.

Adding to 5588.964 gives 5588.964 +13.1340654=5602.0980654 MeV=5.6020980654 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² = 3.57142857 *5.6020980654 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6020980654.

Let me do this multiplication precisely.

3 *5.6020980654 =16.806294196.

0.57142857 *5.6020980654 = ?

0.5 *5.6020980654=2.8010490327.

0.07142857 *5.6020980654.

0.07 *5.6020980654=0.3921468646.

0.00142857 *5.6020980654≈0.007998.

So 0.3921468646 +0.007998≈0.400145.

So 0.57142857 *5.6020980654≈2.8010490327+0.400145≈3.201194.

Adding 16.806294196 +3.201194=20.007488 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.0075, the closest is C)20.132 GeV and D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the nucleus's speed is 0.96c, so we have to calculate the total energy, which is gamma * m0 c², but perhaps the problem states that the energy is given as the kinetic energy, so perhaps I should calculate that.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." That suggests that the energy is providing the speed. So perhaps it's the kinetic energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m0 c².

So let's compute K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6020980654 GeV.

= 2.57142857 *5.6020980654.

Compute 2 *5.6020980654=11.20419613.

0.57142857 *5.6020980654 ≈ as before 3.201194.

So 11.20419613 +3.201194=14.40539 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14 GeV. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy. So 20.0075 GeV is the answer.

But none of the options are exactly that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of the mass is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the mass number without considering the binding energy. Let me think: the mass of the nucleus is not exactly the sum of the individual nucleons because of binding energy. But if I'm using the atomic mass, that should already account for it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the nucleus has a mass of 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass, but that's not correct because neutrons are slightly heavier than protons.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c².

The mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Total mass would be 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = ?

3*938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3*939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u *931.494 MeV/u =5.602098 GeV.

Which is 5602.098 MeV.

So the actual mass is 5602.1 MeV, which is 5633.5 MeV minus 31.4 MeV.

So, using the individual nucleon masses gives a higher value than the actual atomic mass. But in this problem, the correct approach is to use the atomic mass, which is 5602.1 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the rest mass is 6 * m_p. But that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the rest mass is taken as 6 * m_p, where m_p is 938 MeV.

Wait, 6 *938 =5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So if I use m0c²=5.628 GeV, then the total energy would be 3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.5714 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.0714*5.628≈0.403.

So 2.814 +0.403=3.217.

Total is 16.884 +3.217=20.099 GeV.

So approximately 20.1 GeV.

Comparing to the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's very close.

Ah, perhaps the question assumes that the rest mass is 6 * m_p =6 *938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

Then, E=gamma * m0 c² =3.5714 *5.628 GeV≈20.1 GeV.

Which would make option C) 20.132 GeV the correct answer.

So the mistake I made earlier was using the exact atomic mass, but perhaps the question expects the approximation of the rest mass as 6 * m_p.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 6 * the mass of a nucleon. Since a nucleon's mass is about 938 MeV.

But in reality, the exact mass is 5.602 GeV. So why is option C 20.132 GeV?

Wait, let me compute 3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

3.5714 *5.628.

Compute 3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5714 *5.628:

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.0714 *5.628=0.403.

Total 2.814 +0.403=3.217.

So 16.884 +3.217=20.099 + 0.033 (maybe more precise calculation) ≈20.10 GeV.

Option C is 20.132. Hmm, perhaps there's a more precise calculation needed.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma calculation is needed.

Earlier, gamma was 25/7=3.57142857?

Wait, v=0.96c.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So no, gamma is exactly 25/7.

Wait, 25/7 is 3.57142857.

Now, if m0c² is 5.628 GeV, then E=3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 5.628 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628=0.403.

Sum:16.884 +2.814=19.698+0.403=20.101 GeV.

Wait, but 0.57142857 is 4/7, so 5.628 * (4/7) = ?

5.628 /7=0.804. 0.804 *4=3.216.

So 3*5.628=16.884, and 4/7 *5.628=3.216. Sum=20.1.

So, approximately 20.1 GeV. Option C is 20.132, which is very close.

Perhaps the problem expects the approximation, thus the answer is C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The problem specifies the speed \( v = 0.96c \), so we first calculate \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

Next, we calculate the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \) of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.014 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.014 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 5602.1 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6021 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Using the total energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6021 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
E \approx 3.5714 \times 5.6021 \approx 20.007 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result, \( 20.007 \, \text{GeV} \), is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The small discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup. Therefore, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
