Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. The scenario is causing brightness variations that could be mistaken for an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) would need to be relative to the star (Rstar) to produce the same brightness variation amplitude. So, basically, comparing the effect of the spots to an exoplanet transit.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. So, the key here is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip caused by the planet equals the dip caused by the star spots.

Wait, but wait a second. The star spots are causing a variation because their lower temperature makes that part of the star emit less light. So, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically. In this case, the problem states that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that side faces us, the brightness is lower, and when it's not, it's normal.

But how do I calculate the brightness change due to the spots? I think it's related to the area of the spots and their lower brightness compared to the rest of the star.

First, let's think about the area of the spots. The filling factor is 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so the surface area of the star is 4πR², but only one hemisphere is spotty. So, the total area of the hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, wait. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface area that spots cover. But since the star is a sphere, and we're only seeing one hemisphere at a time, the filling factor refers to the entire star? Or just
