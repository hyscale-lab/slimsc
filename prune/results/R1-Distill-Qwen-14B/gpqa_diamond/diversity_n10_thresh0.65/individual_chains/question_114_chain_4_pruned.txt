Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. I'll break it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what each reagent does in these reactions.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide under certain conditions, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, the product is a nitrile. So maybe it's a substitution reaction? Or perhaps it's a two-step process.

Wait, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A gives that product. Let me think about the product structure. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH(CH3)2)CN with an OH group on the same carbon. Wait, actually, the formula is C(CN)(OH)(CH2CH3) perhaps? Let me draw it out mentally.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If it reacts with CN- (from NaCN), perhaps it's an addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. But that would give a cyanohydrin. Wait, a cyanohydrin forms when a ketone adds CN- and H+ in some way. Right, the reaction of ketones with HCN gives cyanohydrins. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's exactly what the first product is. So the first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin.

So the reagents for forming a cyanohydrin are HCN or NaCN with an acid catalyst. Because without acid, the reaction might not proceed. Oh wait, but in the question, the first reagent is NaCN and reagent A. So NaCN provides the cyanide ions, but the reaction needs an acid catalyst because the formation of the cyanohydrin typically requires a proton source to help with the addition.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have reagent A as H3O+ or H3O+. Option C and D have NaHSO3 for A. Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. Hmm, I'm not sure how that would fit here.

Wait, H3O+ is aqueous acid. So if the first reagent is H3O+, that would make sense as the acid catalyst. So in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN (which gives CN- in solution) and H3O+ (acid) would form the cyanohydrin.

So the first part is: A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, the structure is
