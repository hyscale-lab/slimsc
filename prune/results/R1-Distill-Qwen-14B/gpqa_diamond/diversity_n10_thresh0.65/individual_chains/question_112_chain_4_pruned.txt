Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is an electron's state. It's proportional to (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think |up> is the spin-up state along z, and |down> is spin-down along z.

The first part asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij = 침/2 when i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Oh, wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the state is two-dimensional (spin-1/2 system). So, the operator A has zero on the diagonal and 침/2 elsewhere. Let me write that out:

A = [ [0, 침/2],
      [침/2, 0] ]

So, this is the operator whose eigenstates we need to find the measurement probabilities for. But wait, actually, the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. So, I think I need to diagonalize A and find its eigenstates, then compute the probabilities by taking the square of the amplitudes of |alpha> in those eigenstates.

The second part of the question asks for the average value of operator A. That would be the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>.

Wait, but before that, I need to normalize |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional to that combination, so we must find the normalization factor.

Let me start by normalizing |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Compute the inner product:

(1 - i)* (1 + i) + (2 + i)*(2 -i) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Wait, actually, the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) for the first term, and (2 - i)(2 + i) for the second term.

Calculating each term:

First term: (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Second term: (2 -i)(2 + i) = 4
