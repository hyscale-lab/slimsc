Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes. The eigenvectors are the states where measuring the observable gives the corresponding eigenvalue.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, the overall operator vector P would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component (n_y) should be zero. Oh wait, wait. Wait, actually, no. The x-z plane means that the direction vector has non-zero x and z components, but y could be zero. Wait no, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So if n is in the x-z plane, then n_y is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, the direction is arbitrary, so n could be any direction in x-z plane, so the components might not be zero. Wait, no, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1, and n_y=0.

Wait, but the problem says n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so n could be any direction where n_y=0, but n_x and n_z can vary as long as n_x² + n_z² =1. So the operator P would be along n, so P = n·σ * ħ/2? Wait, because each component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are 2x2 matrices. Let me recall each:

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So given that, P_x is (ħ/2) σx, P_y is (ħ/2) σy, P_z is (ħ/2) σz.

So the operator P along direction n would be:

P = n_x P_x + n_y
