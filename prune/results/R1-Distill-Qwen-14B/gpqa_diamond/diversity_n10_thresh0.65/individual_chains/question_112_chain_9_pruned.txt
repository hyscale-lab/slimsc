Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, I should probably normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, so I guess I need to find the normalization factor first.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if iâ‰ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that operator look like? Let's think about the basis. Since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix. So, for a 2x2 matrix, A would have zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So it's like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, or is it? Because the question says A_ij = hbar/2 when iâ‰ j, so for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (when i=j) would be 0, and off-diagonal (iâ‰ j) would be hbar/2. So yeah, that's correct.

So the operator A looks like a Pauli matrix multiplied by some factor. I remember that the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, right?

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So the eigenstates of A are these, and their corresponding eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator A. So, to find those probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and
