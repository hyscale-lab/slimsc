Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's go through it carefully.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectroscopic data to determine the structure of Compound X.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an alkyne (C-H stretch). The peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong and likely indicates a carbonyl group, such as a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) - That's a broad singlet, which is very high. Common for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm and are usually broad. If the compound has a carbonyl (from IR), maybe it's a benzoic acid or something similar. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) - These are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The double doublet suggests maybe two sets of protons, each as doublets. So, for example, in para-substituted rings like p-xylene, or something with substituents on opposite carbons.

Looking at the integration: 2H each, so it's likely that the benzene has two substituents, each with a pair of protons. So it's probably a disubstituted benzene. The protons on the ring are split into two doublets, which suggests they are in two distinct environments but each as a pair.

Next, the other peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) - A multiplet, maybe a CH group connected to something else. Perhaps a CH in a side chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) - Another multiplet, maybe two adjacent CH2 groups? Or part of a longer chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) - A triplet of 3H as a doublet. This is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. For example, in a structure like CH(CH3)2, the methyl groups are split into a triplet, but wait, the integration here is 3H. Wait, no, in isopropyl, the central CH would have three Hs on each CH3, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, like a CH2 connected to something else.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) - A triplet, probably a terminal methyl group, like at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe CH2CH3 as a substituent.

Putting this together: The benzene ring is para-substituted. Each substituent is probably a group attached to the ring. Let me think about the substituents.

Looking at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So if the benzene ring is para-substituted with a carbonyl-containing group, perhaps it's a ketone, ester, or acid.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm. That's a very high shift. If it's a carbonyl, and the proton is at 10.5, maybe it's an aldehyde? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, could it be a carboxylic acid? But then, the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1, which the IR data has in the 3400–2500 range. Wait, the first peak is 3400–2500, which could include O-H stretch. But is the 1720 peak a carbonyl from a carboxylic acid? Wait, carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit lower. So 1720 is a bit higher, perhaps an ester or ketone.

Wait, let me think: The IR absorption for a carboxylic acid is usually in the range of 1700-1725 cm-1, so 1720 could fit. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the NMR would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak. But wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet. Carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak because of the exchange with water, but in NMR, the integration is 1H, which makes sense for a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So if the ring is para-substituted with a benzoic acid group, then there's another substituent on the ring. Wait, but looking at the NMR, after the aromatic protons, we have other signals.

Wait, the aromatic protons are 2H each at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So the substituents on the benzene are probably in the para positions. Let's say substituent A is in position 1 and
