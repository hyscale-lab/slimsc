Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves a reaction scheme starting with compound A and going through several reactions to eventually form compound E. I need to figure out what compound E is based on the given information and the options provided.

Let me list out the reactions first:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (which I think is nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

So, I need to figure out the structure of each compound from A to E, starting from the information given.

First, I'll think about the reaction steps.

Step 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN is a nucleophile. It typically adds to carbonyl groups. Since HCN adds to ketones or aldehydes, A might be a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, the IR of A is around 1750 cm^-1. That's in the range for a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone (around 1700-1750 for ketones). So A is likely a ketone.

When a ketone reacts with HCN, it undergoes addition, forming a cyanohydrin. So compound B would be a cyanohydrin. The structure would have an -O-CH2-CN group attached where the carbonyl was.

Wait, but the product is a cyanohydrin. So the carbonyl becomes an alcohol and a cyanide group attached to the adjacent carbon. So for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be cyclohexanol cyanohydrin, which is 1-cyclohexanol-2-cyanocyclohexanol, but that's a bit more complex.

But looking at hint a), when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm. Phosphorous ylides are used in Wittig reactions, which convert aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So the Wittig reaction implies that A has a carbonyl group, which reacts with the ylide to form an alkene.

Wait, but the product from the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure in my mind. Cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and position 4 has a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)= something. Wait, no. The ylidene group is CH2-C(CH3)-, but as a substituent on the ring.

Wait, the structure would be cyclopentane with substituents: at 1 and 2 positions, methyl groups. At 4 position, a substituent that's a propenyl group? Because the Wittig forms alkenes.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent on position 4 is propan-2-ylidene, which is CH2-C(CH3)— but as a ylidene, perhaps it's a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Wittig reaction. The ylide has a structure like Ph3P=CHR, and when it reacts with a carbonyl (like ketone), it forms an alkene.

So the starting material A must have a carbonyl group, and the Wittig forms a double bond.

In the product, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)— but as a substituent on the ring. So perhaps the propan-2-ylidene is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, ylidene usually implies a double bond. So propan-2-ylidene would be the group =CH-C(CH3)2? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the propan-2-ylidene is a substituent like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the cyclopentane ring.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent at position 4 is an isopropenyl group. So the structure would be a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and an isopropenyl group at position 4.

Wait, the isopropenyl group is CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the ring. So the ring has three substituents: methyl at 1, methyl at 2, and CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 at
