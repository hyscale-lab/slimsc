Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Let's see what I remember about neutrinos and the Sun. So, I know that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton (pp) chains. There are different branches in the pp chain, like the I, II, and III branches. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm.

The pp-III branch is the dominant one, right? I think it's responsible for about 90% of the Sun's energy production. So if this branch stops suddenly, the Sun's energy output would decrease, but what happens to the neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in the core, and they escape the Sun quickly, so the Earth would detect them almost as soon as they're produced. But wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is about the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in neutrino flux from the stopped branch would have already reached us, right? But in this hypothetical scenario, the flux is calculated as if the branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so we're looking at the current flux now.

So neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch, I believe. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, specifically the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands mentioned. Wait, neutrinos from the pp-III branch are the main source of the solar neutrinos we detect. So if this branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in those energy bands?

But wait, the question is about the ratio of flux in two bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let me think about how the flux depends on the production in each band. So if the pp-III branch is gone, the flux in both bands would decrease, but perhaps not by the same amount.

Wait, but maybe neutrinos from the pp-III branch are the main contributors in those bands. So if we stop that branch, the production of those neutrinos would stop. But the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So other branches, like pp-I or pp-II, are still active, but contribute less to the neutrino flux in those specific energy bands.

Hmm, the pp-I branch is a minor contributor, I think. So without the pp-III, the main source of neutrinos in those energy ranges is gone. But what about other sources? Are there other reactions that produce neutrinos in those energy bands? For example, the CNO cycle also produces neutrinos, but I think they're lower in energy. Or wait, maybe not. Let me recall: the proton-proton chain produces neutrinos via the beta decay of beryllium-7 to lithium-7, releasing a positron and a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around a few hundred keV, I think. So the pp-III branch would produce neutrinos in these 700-800 and 800-900 keV ranges.

If the pp-III branch stops, the flux from it would drop to zero. So the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would come only from any other sources, which I assume are negligible. Similarly for band 2 (800-900 keV). So both bands would have very low flux, but what about the ratio between them?

Wait, but in the pp-III branch, the distribution of neutrino energies might peak in a certain range. So perhaps the 700-800 keV band is more dominated by the pp-III neutrinos than the 800-900 keV band. Or is it the other way around? Or maybe their production rates are similar.

Alternatively, maybe the flux in each energy band is proportional to the number of neutrinos produced in that band. So if the pp-III branch is the main source, and it stops, the flux in both bands drops, but the ratio would depend on how much each band was dependent on the pp-III.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is the main contributor, and it's the only source for these bands, then both fluxes would drop to almost zero. But the question is about the ratio. So if both are zero, the ratio is undefined,
