Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider where the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that relativistic energies involve gamma factors. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? So gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

So, let me calculate gamma. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so v²/c² = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh yeah, sqrt(0.0784) is correct. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus X. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium typically has 3 protons, right? So depending on the isotope. Let me think. Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that's Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons=6 nucleons. So Li-6.

The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be approximated using the mass of a proton and neutron. But wait, the exact mass might require knowing the atomic mass. Alternatively, I think the mass can be found using the atomic weight. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c², but perhaps it's better to look up the actual mass.

Alternatively, I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, no, wait. The mass of a single nucleon is about 1.00335 u (for protons) and 1.008665 u for neutrons. But maybe a better approach is to use the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the molar mass. Li-6 has a molar mass of about 6 g/mol (but exact value? Maybe I should look it up. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So each nucleon contributes roughly that.

Wait, but the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 atomic mass units. I think I've seen that before. So 6.0151 u. Each u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so the rest mass energy is:

m = 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's calculate that.

6 *931.5 is 5589, and 0.0151 *931.5 is approximately 14.03. So total is about 5603 MeV, which is 5.603 GeV.

Wait, that's the rest mass. So the rest energy is m*c², which is 5.603 GeV.

Now, the total energy of the nucleus in the collider is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. So gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5 *5.6 is 19.6, but we have more precise numbers
