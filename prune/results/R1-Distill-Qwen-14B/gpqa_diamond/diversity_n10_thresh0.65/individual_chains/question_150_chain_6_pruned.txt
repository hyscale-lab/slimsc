Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me take it step by step.

First, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. That's a good starting point. The NMR data is provided, so I need to use that to determine the structure before any reactions happen.

Looking at the 1H NMR:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. A triplet in aromatic regions often suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Maybe an aromatic proton adjacent to two others? Or maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. A triplet might be a bit unusual for an aldehyde, though. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: an aromatic ring with substituents. Maybe para substitution? Or maybe an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring.

Next peak at 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet, two protons. Could be a pair of aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring. Like a para-disubstituted benzene where the two protons are adjacent to substituents, causing a coupling. Or maybe they're part of a coupling with another set of protons, like in a vicinal di-substituted structure.

Then 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): another doublet, two protons. Maybe this is part of a conjugated system. Like maybe a di-substituted benzene with substituents in such a way that the coupling is between adjacent protons.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like an OH group in proximity. Or perhaps it's some kind of vinylic proton that's not splitting much. Wait, but it's a singlet, so maybe they're not next to any other equivalent protons. Maybe these are protons on a ring that's also got some substituents, or maybe they're part of an enol or something that's exchanging quickly on the NMR timescale.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, integral of 2H. That's a common pattern for a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe it's something like OCH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents, and an aldehyde group. Or maybe the substit
