Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Now, the researchers want to observe which one has a higher probability of transiting. They have limited time, so they need to choose the one more likely to transit.

From the problem, both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii because one is slightly evolved, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for transit probability, as I recall, is something like (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (a * sin i)) or something. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh right, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the probability simplifies.

Wait, actually, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a) * something else? Or perhaps it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius? Hmm, maybe I should think about the geometry involved.

Oh wait, the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2 )^0.5 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is needed.

Wait, another way: the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a) multiplied by something. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, correct formula: the transit probability (P) is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Oh no, wait, no: the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the probability that the planet
