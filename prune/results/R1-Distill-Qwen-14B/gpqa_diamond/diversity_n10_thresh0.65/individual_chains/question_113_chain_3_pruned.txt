Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

First, the question gives me three characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the data.

Starting with the FTIR data. The main peaks mentioned are at 3000 cm^-1, which is a very broad peak. Broad peaks around 3000 typically indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the protons are acidic and easily ionize. Alcohols also have a broad peak, but maybe less so. But the question says "very broad", which makes me think more of a carboxylic acid or maybe a carbonyl group? Hmm, not sure yet.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But why is there another one at 1650? That's a bit lower. What functional groups have peaks around there? Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like C=C stretching. Oh wait, also, an ester carbonyl is around 1740, but maybe if it's conjugated, it could be lower. Alternatively, a conjugated carbonyl group or maybe an
