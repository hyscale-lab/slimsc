Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations. They're comparing this to the brightness changes caused by an exoplanet. I need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the star's spots do.

Alright, let me break it down. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so R_star is about 1 R_sun. Each hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. But wait, the temperature of the spots compared to the starâ€”so the spots are T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

The problem mentions that photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating and the spots come into and out of view. The setup is such that this situation can mimic an exoplanet. So, the question is asking, if there was no spots, what exoplanet radius would cause the same brightness dip (same amplitude) as the spots do.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (the amplitude) caused by the spots and then set that equal to the dip caused by the planet and solve for the planet's radius.

So, the steps probably are:

1. Calculate the flux from the normal star and the flux from the spotted area.
2. Compute the change in total flux when the spots are facing us versus when they're not.
3. That change is the amplitude of the variation.
4. For the exoplanet, the dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2. So, set that equal to the flux change from the spots and solve for R_planet / R_star.

But wait, the star has spots on one hemisphere. So, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. But since it's only one hemisphere, the maximum coverage is when the spots are fully visible. Hmm. So, the star's surface is about half spotted (as in, 20% of each hemisphere? Or wait, the "filling factor" is 20%, meaning that
