Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. The given data includes the initial concentration of the complex and the formation constant, K. 

Hmm, let me recall what I know. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is a 1:1 complex, so the formula would be CaY^2- or something similar. 

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other reactions affecting the EDTA or calcium availability. 

The formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. Formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for Kf in this case would be something like K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but I might have to think about the charges. EDTA is usually in the form H4Y, but at the pH that's ideal for Ca-EDTA complex formation, it's deprotonated to Y^4-.

So, the reaction is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is 5e10. 

Wait, but wait. If I have the complex in solution, it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions is what we're trying to find.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M. But wait, when it dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Assuming that the dissociation is minimal because K is large. Wait, no. Wait, K is the formation constant, which is very large
