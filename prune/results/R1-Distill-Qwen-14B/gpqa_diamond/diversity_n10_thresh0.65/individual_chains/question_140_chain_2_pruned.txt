Hmm, okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and try to break it down.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier than the usual one. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. When X and Y react, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog, so it's probably something common.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, I need to figure out what X is, then identify its constituent elements, and calculate their lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses.

Breaking it down:

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction usually indicates something like an acid-base reaction, redox reaction, or maybe something more vigorous like a reaction between a strong acid and a metal. But since it's a precipitate that forms, maybe a double displacement reaction where an insoluble compound is formed.

Gas W: same number of protons and neutrons. So what gases have this property? Let's think about common gases. For example, Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, but it's a noble gas. Hydrogen has 1 proton, but its isotopes have varying neutrons. Wait, but the molecule of gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So if it's a molecule like H2O, no. Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is something like NH3? No, because NH3 has 14 (N) and 3 H's. Wait, but the molecule's protons and neutrons? Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify: the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, that might be a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's that each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, CO2: carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CO, but that's a molecule
