Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, that's the thing where the population of a higher energy level is less than the lower one because of the thermal energy.

So the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, twice as excited... I think that refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state. So, if I call the number of atoms in the specific energy level as N, then for star_1, N1 is twice N2, so N1 = 2*N2.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that must be the energy difference delta E. Because the Boltzmann factor involves the energy difference over k*T.

The Boltzmann equation is N2/N1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The ratio of populations is N_upper / N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower. So if the excited state is higher than the ground state, then N_upper is less than N_lower unless T is really high.

In this case, the excited level is higher, so N_upper is less than N_lower. But wait, the question says the atoms in star_
