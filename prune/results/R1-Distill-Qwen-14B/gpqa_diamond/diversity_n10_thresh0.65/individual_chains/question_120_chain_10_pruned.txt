Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me make sure I understand the question. It says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is uniform in space. So, the number of stars doesn't depend on where you look in the universe—every region has the same density of stars.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I'm looking at a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars (let's say N) in that range depend on plx?

I remember that when dealing with distances and volume, the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of that shell. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, but since we're dealing with a thin shell, the volume would be approximately 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance) and dr is the thickness of the shell.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/r (in parsecs), then r = 1/plx. So, as plx increases (meaning the star is closer), the distance r decreases.

Let me think about the range of parallaxes. If I consider a small change in parallax, dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Let's see, plx = 1/r → dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So, dr = - r² dplx. But since r is positive, and dplx is positive when plx increases (which is when r decreases), maybe I should take the absolute value. So, dr = r² dplx.

Now, the number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the volume of the shell times the star density (which is uniform). Let's denote the density as n stars per cubic parsec. So, N = n * (4 π r² dr) = 4 π n r² dr.

But since we're looking at N per unit parallax (dplx), and dr = r² dplx, I can substitute that in. So N = 4 π n r² * (dr) → but dr is r² dplx, so N = 4 π n r² * r² dplx = 4 π n r^4 dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me go again. Because N is the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. So, r = 1/plx, and dr = r² dplx as before.

So the number of stars should be proportional to the volume of the shell (4 π r² dr) times the density (n). So N = n * 4 π r² dr.

But since dr = r² dplx, substituting that in:

N = n * 4 π r² * (r² dplx) = 4 π n
