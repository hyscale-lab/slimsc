Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, astronauts, two of them, with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Because at high speeds, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, no, wait. Oh right, if two objects are moving at u and v in the same direction, the relative speed isn't u minus v directly. It's a bit more complicated.

Let me think. So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. The relative speed would be from the perspective of one astronaut, say, the first one, seeing the second one. Or wait, which way is the relative speed? Oh, the problem says "relative speed", so I guess it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's frame, B is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c*0.5c)/c²). Wait, wait, no, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, no, wait what's the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me get it right. The general formula is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²) when you're changing frames. Oh wait, no, that's for when you have two frames moving with speed u' relative to each other, and you want the speed of an object moving at u' in one frame as seen in the other.

Wait, perhaps I should think carefully. So, in the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at u =0.6c, astronaut B is moving at v=0.5c. We want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So, using the velocity transformation formula, the speed u’ of B in A’s frame is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²).

So plugging the numbers in: v is 0.5c, u is 0.6c. So:

u’ = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² )

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = (-0.1c). Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 -0.3 = 0.7.

So u’= (-0.1c) /0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. Negative sign means direction is opposite, but the speed is 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c, and it's in the opposite direction, but the options just give the magnitude, I think.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So either C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy. The system's total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each has their own energy, which is gamma times m c squared.

So for astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 )= 1/sqrt(0.75)= approximately 1.1547.

So E2= gamma2 *3m c²= 1.1547 *3m c²= about 3.464m c².

Total energy E_total= E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c².

Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5mc². So option C matches the energy calculation.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula for the relative velocity \( u' \) of an object moving at speed \( v \) in the frame of another object moving at speed \( u \) is:

\[
u' = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A moves at \( u = 0.6c \), and astronaut B moves at \( v = 0.5c \), both in the same direction. Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the relative velocity is in the opposite direction, but the magnitude is approximately \( 0.14c \). Therefore, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut 1 (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut 2 (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

From the options, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
