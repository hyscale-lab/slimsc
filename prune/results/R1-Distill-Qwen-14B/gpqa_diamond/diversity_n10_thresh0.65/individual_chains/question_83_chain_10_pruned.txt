Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should probably figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Then, think about the titration process.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be... let's see. Using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.0125 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid (CH3COOH) to form its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-), and water.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the first part is about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it refers to the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the equivalence point volume. Or wait, maybe 25% of the moles required to reach equivalence.

Wait, maybe I should find the equivalence point volume first. Because knowing the equivalence point will help me determine what 25% of that volume is.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution:

Molarity is 0.0125 M, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Moles = M * V = 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So, at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed would be equal to moles of acetic acid. Because the reaction is 1:1.

Moles NaOH = 0.0005. So volume = moles / M = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 cm³.

Wait, that's the volume needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.0125 M. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.0125 *
