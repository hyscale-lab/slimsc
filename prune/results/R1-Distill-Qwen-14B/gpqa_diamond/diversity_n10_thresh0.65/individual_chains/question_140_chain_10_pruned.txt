Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I remember is around 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, that's just above freezing. 

Also, the product when a keto acid reacts with X has two oxygen atoms. Oh, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. The question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what X is. Since it's a reagent in organic chemistry and has a heavier isotope, maybe it's something like a halogen? Because halogens often have common heavier isotopes, like chlorine having Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or maybe it's something like sodium or potassium, but I'm not sure yet.

The reaction is violent with liquid Y. Violent reactions could be something like a metal reacting with an acid. For example, sodium reacting with water (liquid Y could be water). But then the product would be sodium hydroxide, hydrogen gas, etc. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogen reacting with something else, but that's less likely since halogens are often liquids or solids.

Wait, when X reacts with Y, a gas W is released. The gas has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. If the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, what could that be? Let's think of some gases. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron (if it's deuterium), but wait, hydrogen has one proton and one neutron is deuterium, but the molecule would be H2 or D2. So for H2, each molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's HD, but maybe the question is referring to each molecule). Wait, the problem states the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, protons equal neutrons. So for H2, each H atom has 1 proton, but in deuterium, each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So HD would have (1+1) protons and (1+0) neutrons?
