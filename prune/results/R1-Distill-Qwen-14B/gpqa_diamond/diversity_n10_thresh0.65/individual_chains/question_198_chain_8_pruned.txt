Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. Oh right, stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a metal ion to form a complex with ligands.

The problem states that we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's interesting because β4 is lower than β3. So what does that mean? Well, the stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands attached, but sometimes they can decrease. So perhaps the trend here isn't straightforward. Like, β1 is for the monodentate complex, β2 for the next, and so on.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Oh wait, the blue ones are probably the more stable complexes. I remember that in crystal field theory, different geometries and ligands affect the color. But I'm more focused on the stability constants here.

So, the main idea is to find the fraction of Co(II) that's in the form of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think would be the complex with two SCN- ligands. Wait, but wait, the problem mentions "dithiocyanato," which I think refers to a complex with two SCN- ions. So that's probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which would correspond to the β2 value of 40? But wait, the β values are given for each step. Let me think about how this works.

Stability constants are for the formation of complexes step by step. So, β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc. Each β represents the equilibrium for adding another SCN- ion. So, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 to βn. Wait, no, no. Wait, βn is the stability constant for the nth step. So, the overall stability constant for forming Co(SCN)_n from Co(SCN)_{n-1} and an SCN- ion. So the total β for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let's clarify.

Stability constants are determined for each step of complex formation. So, the first step is Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ with β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]). The second step is CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^2+ with β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-]). Similarly, β3 is for adding another SCN- to form Co(SCN)_3^3+, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^4-.

So, the overall stability constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1β2β3...βn. Wait, no. Hold on, for each step, the overall β for the first n ligands would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because each β is for the nth ligand addition, so the cumulative product gives the overall K for the complexation up to that point.

Wait, for example, the overall K for Co(SCN)_2^2+ is β1 * β2. Because K1 = β1 is for the first ligand, and K2 = β2 is for the second.

So, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, and the overall stability for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

But wait, maybe I should check an example. Let's say, for the formation of Co(SCN)_2^2+:

The first step
