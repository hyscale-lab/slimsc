Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light moving through different media, the index of refraction plays a big role. But wait, the glass is moving too. That adds another layer because of relative motion between the glass and the lab frame.

Right, the index of refraction n tells us how light slows down in a medium. The general formula is v = c/n, where v is the speed in the medium. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh, right, this is probably a case involving special relativity. Because when objects move at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to consider how different frames perceive each other's measurements. Oh wait, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is going in the same direction as the beam towards the observer. So, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam as observed in the lab.

Wait, so in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because light's speed in the medium is c divided by n. But when the medium is moving, you have to adjust the speed according to the observer in the lab frame.

So, I think this is about adding velocities relativistically. Because velocities don't just add up linearly when you get close to the speed of light. So, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ²),
