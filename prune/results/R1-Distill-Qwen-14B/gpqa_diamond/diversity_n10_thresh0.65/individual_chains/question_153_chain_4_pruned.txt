Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. There are three parts: A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them with the options given (A, B, C, D).

First, I'll tackle part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled A.

Wait, what's a Michael addition? I remember that the Michael reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So the enolate acts as the nucleophile, and the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the electrophilic partner.

In this case, the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has an alpha-beta unsaturated ester group, making it a good Michael acceptor.

So the reaction should be a Michael addition where the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how the products form. Let me think. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups on a malonic acid. When it forms an enolate, it would lose a methyl group as a leaving group (since it's a good leaving group) and form a conjugated base. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. So when deprotonated, the enolate would be CH2(COOCH2^-) with a negative charge on the central carbon.

The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is something like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no—actually, the structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, let me get that right. The formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, maybe the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, no, wait—acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but wait, acrylate has three carbons: CH2-CH2-COO-? No, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the three carbons are CH2, CH, and COO. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon? That doesn't make sense because that would make it a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl group is on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-OCH3 with the p-tolyl attached to the third carbon?
