Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for their relative speed.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the relative speed from one astronaut's frame to the other. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. I think the formula for the relative velocity u' is (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the frame. But which one's frame are we considering? Oh right, if B is moving at 0.5c and A is moving at 0.6c in the same direction, then from B's frame, what's A's velocity?

So let me set u as A's velocity, which is 0.6c, and v as B's velocity, which is 0.5c. So the relative velocity u' (from B's frame) would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the denominator first. 0.6*0.5 = 0.3, so 0.3c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. Numerator is 0.1c. So u' = (0.1c) / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857, so about 0.143c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That's one of the options, looking at the choices, options C and D have 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy of the system. I think each astronaut's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, calculate the energy for astronaut A. Mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma for A: sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Next for astronaut B. Mass is 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma for B: sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is about 1.1547. E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3 * 1.1547 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this approximation. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So option C would have the correct E.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for gamma, maybe I missed a decimal place.

For A: v=0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m c². Correct.

For B: v=0.5c. v²/c² =0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(3)/2)= 2/(sqrt(3))≈1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547≈3.464 m c². Sum is about 5.964, which is 5.96 when rounded to two decimal places. So option C gives E=5.96 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options:

Option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (velocity of astronaut A) and \(v = 0.5c\) (velocity of astronaut B). Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
Mass of astronaut A: \(2m\), velocity: \(0.6c\). Calculate \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of astronaut A:

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
Mass of astronaut B: \(3m\), velocity: \(0.5c\). Calculate \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of astronaut B:

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
