Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So when a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and farther stars have smaller parallax.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. I'm a bit confused, but let's break it down. So, if I plot the number of stars in a given range of parallax, how does that number depend on plx?

Wait, I think I remember something about the volume of space. Since stars are spread uniformly, the number of stars in a certain volume should be proportional to the volume itself. Oh right, because the density is uniform, the number of stars depends on the volume.

But wait, how does parallax relate to distance? Parallax plx is equal to 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, the distance decreases. 

Now, let's think about the volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if I consider stars within a certain distance range, say from d to d + dd, the volume would be proportional to (d)^3. Because the change in volume is the volume of a thin shell, which is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d² dd.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd (a change in d) would be related to d_plx, the change in parallax.

Let me think about differentials. d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d_plx. The minus sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the purposes of magnitude, I can ignore the sign, so |dd| = (1/plx²) d_plx. 

Wait, the number of stars in a range of parallax d_plx would be the number in the corresponding range of distance. So the number of stars between d and d + dd is proportional to the volume shell, which is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) d_pl
