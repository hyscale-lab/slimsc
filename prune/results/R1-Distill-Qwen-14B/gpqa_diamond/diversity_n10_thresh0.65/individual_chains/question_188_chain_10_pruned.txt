Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's see what I can remember.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles α, β, and γ are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate it and pick the right one.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all sides are equal and all angles are the same. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been skewed a bit. But in this case, all the angles are 30 degrees, which is quite a skew.

The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. I'm assuming that refers to the lattice parameter 'a', which is the edge length of the unit cell. Because in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are of the same length. So a = 10 Angstrom.

The interplanar distance, d(hkl), is calculated using the formula from Bragg's Law, right? The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * [1 + 2cosα (cosβ cosγ - sinβ sinγ cos(α - γ)))] / (1 - cosα)^2 ... Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Or perhaps I should think
