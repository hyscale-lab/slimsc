Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. So first, I should find the concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, so total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. Oh right, volume in liters. So 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So at the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to acetate ions. 

But the question also asks about the pH at 25% titration. So we're adding 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. Let me think about how to approach each part.

First, let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The diluted acetic acid has 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, when you titrate, the volumes mix, but for the equivalence point, I think the exact volume is when moles are equal, regardless of the mixing. So yes, 10 cm³ is correct.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. So moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of acetic acid neutralized is 0.00025, leaving the remaining acetic acid as 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. But wait, the total solution volume at 25% titration would be initial solution (40 cm³) plus NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So 42.5 cm³ total. So concentrations would be [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of dilution and then the buffer solution. Because when you add a strong base to a weak acid, you create a buffer of the acid and its conjugate base. So at 25% titration,
