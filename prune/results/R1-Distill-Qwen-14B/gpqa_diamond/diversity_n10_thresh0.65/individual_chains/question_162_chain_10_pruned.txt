Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's only got dx and dy. So the space is two-dimensional, maybe like a surface in some higher-dimensional space?

The question is asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm a bit confused about how that relates to the metric given here.

First, I should recall that in differential geometry, the area of a surface can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. But wait, no, actually, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the metric is conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). So the determinant should be straightforward.

Let me write down the metric components. If the metric is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², then for this case, g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{xy}=0. So the determinant g is (g_{xx})(g_{yy}) - (g_{xy})², which would be [32/(4
