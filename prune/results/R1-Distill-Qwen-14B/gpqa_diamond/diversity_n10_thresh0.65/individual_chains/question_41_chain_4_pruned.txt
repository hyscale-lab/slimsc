Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling through a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, okay, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the glass is moving in the same direction the light is going. But the light is propagating through the glass, which is itself moving.

I remember that when a medium is moving, you have to consider the effects of motion on the properties of the medium and how light travels through it. I think this relates to the concept of relativistic velocities and how different frames of reference affect measurements. But wait, the options don't look too complicated, maybe I don't need to go into full relativity here. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in the glass, the light's speed is 1/n because here c is 1.

But wait, the glass is moving. So the observer in the lab is seeing the glass moving, so how does that affect the speed of
