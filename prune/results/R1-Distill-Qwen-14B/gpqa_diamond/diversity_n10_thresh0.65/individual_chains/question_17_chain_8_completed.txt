Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration given is 0.02 M, the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. So, in this case, Ca²+ is binding with EDTA to form a complex, right? The problem states that the solution has a stoichiometric amount of the Ca-EDTA complex. That probably means that all the calcium is tied up in the complex, and I need to find how much free calcium is in solution.

Wait, but wait. The formation constant, K, is given as 5e10. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal and EDTA combine to form the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So Kf is 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, what's the question again? Oh right, the concentration of calcium ions in solution.

Wait, but the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA. So when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But wait, since the solution is stochiometric, maybe all the EDTA is tied up in the complex with Ca²+. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, stochiometric usually refers to the molar ratio. So if the solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's because Ca²+ and EDTA are present in a 1:1 molar ratio. So perhaps EDTA is present in excess or just the right amount to form the complex.

Wait wait, maybe the solution is simply 0.02 M of the complex, and I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me think about this. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- that dissociate from the complex. So, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M (since K is large, x will be small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02). But wait, wait, no. Because K is very large (5e10), the dissociation is very small. So x is negligible compared to 0.02. So [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M.

So the equilibrium expression is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in the solution, the EDTA comes from the complex dissociation. Wait, but if the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, then the initial EDTA would be from the complex. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me structure this more clearly.

Assumptions:
- The complex is [CaEDTA]^2-.

At initial:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.
[Ca²+] = 0 (because all Ca is in the complex), but this can't be right because EDTA is present in solution.

Wait, no, wait. No, because the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So when you have the complex in solution, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me let the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium be s. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- is also s, because each mole of complex dissociates into one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the formation constant equation is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(s * s) = 5e10.

Wait, but wait, wait. If [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are s each, then:

5e10 = (0.02)/(s^2).

So solving for s^2:

s^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So s^2 = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/(5e12)) ) = 4e-13.

Wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2 /5 ) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So s^2 = 4e-13 → s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Let me compute the square root.

sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 2e-6 squared is 4e-12. Hmm, but 4e-13 is smaller than that.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) → 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Ah, so s is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] = 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the initial setup: the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the complex will dissociate a little bit:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

Let the change be x. So:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x is very small).

[Ca²+] = x.

[EDTA^4-] = x.

So Kf = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5)*1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, wait, now I'm getting a different number. Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, that's the same as before. So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.3e-7, which is the same as before.

So [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions in solution is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
