Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT, and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4. The options given are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which symmetries are mandatory.

First, what's SMEFT? I remember it's a framework where you take the Standard Model and add higher-dimensional operators to include possible beyond the SM physics. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc. But the key here is that these operators have to respect certain symmetries.

So the symmetries in question are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let's go one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think that all terms in the Lagrangian must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because the SM does, and SMEFT is an effective theory that should reduce to the SM when the new physics is at high scales. So any operator must be a Lorentz scalar, or more precisely, the operators should form a Lorentz-invariant set. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So option 1 is correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, which means momentum conservation and so on. I think the SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT should as well. Wait, but wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, right? Would it still respect Poincare? Or is it more about the symmetries of the Lagrangian? The Lagrangian in SMEFT should still be Poincare invariant. Because Poincare includes translations, so the equations of motion are derived from the action, which requires Poincare symmetry. So all operators must respect Poincare? So 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: I'm not so sure. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation exists in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP, can SMEFT operators violate CP? Well, SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must; operators can violate CP. So 3 is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM respects CPT symmetry. From what I remember, in quantum field theory, all Lorentz-invariant theories respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way the theory is constructed, you have to have CPT symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must be part of a CPT-symmetric set. Wait, but wait: can operators in SMEFT violate CPT? Because if an operator violates CPT, then that would break some fundamental principles. But I think that in SMEFT, the theory as a whole is assumed to respect CPT. So all operators must be arranged in a way that the overall Lagrangian is CPT-symmetric. So individual operators can be CPT violating, but when you look at the full theory, you must have CPT symmetry. Hmm, I'm a little fuzzy on this. Alternatively, perhaps all operators must be CPT-symmetric by themselves. I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, in the SMEFT, the operators are built in such a way that they form a basis which is CPT-closed. That is, if you have an operator that violates CPT, you must have another operator that compensates for it to maintain CPT symmetry. Or perhaps all operators are CPT-symmetric on their own. I think the latter is the case. Because, in the standard SMEFT approach, the operators are constructed to be renormalizable-like terms, and higher-dimension operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects CPT, so SMEFT operators must too. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The SM doesn't have CPT symmetry? No, the SM respects CPT.
