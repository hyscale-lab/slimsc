Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a wave function. Hmm, I remember that wave functions must satisfy the normalization condition, which means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Oh wait, but in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so the integral should be from 1 to 3.

The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, wait. Wait a second, the wave function is a complex function here. Because it has an 'i' term, which is the square root of -1. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, usually wave functions are expressed as a sum of real and imaginary parts, but for normalization, we take the absolute square, which is the product of the function and its complex conjugate. 

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1. Let's write ψ(x) as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Then the complex conjugate of ψ(x) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. 

Now, when you multiply ψ by its conjugate, you get |a/sqrt(1+x)|² plus the cross terms. Let me calculate that. So, [ (a/(sqrt(
