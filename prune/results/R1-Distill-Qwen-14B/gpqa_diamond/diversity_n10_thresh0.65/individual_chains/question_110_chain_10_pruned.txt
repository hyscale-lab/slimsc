Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and the spectrographs that can detect them. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key here is their apparent V magnitudes because each spectrograph has a brightness limit. Oh right, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag, meaning it can see stars up to 17 mag, but anything brighter (lower number) than that is okay. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So if a telescope can observe up to V=17, that means it can see stars as faint as 17 mag. So, a star with V=16 is brighter (and can be seen) by both, but a star with V=18 is too faint for ESPRESSO but maybe HIRES can't see it either.

Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, so if a star is brighter than 17, meaning V <17, then ESPRESSO can see it. Wait, no, wait. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if the limit is V=17, then any star with V less than 17 is brighter and can be observed. So for example, a V=16 star is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So any star with V <16 mag is
