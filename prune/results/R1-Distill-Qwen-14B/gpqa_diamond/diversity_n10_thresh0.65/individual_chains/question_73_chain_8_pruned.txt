Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: there are two astronauts, their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question wants the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different values for v_rel and E.

Wait, I need to find two things: the relative speed and the total energy. Let me tackle them one by one.

First, the relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds normally. The formula is (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), right?

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The relative speed of astronaut 2 with respect to astronaut 1. So if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, since they're both in the same direction, in the Earth frame, the relative speed is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? But wait, no, because that's Galilean addition, which isn't correct at high speeds. So I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition.

So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the second object relative to the first. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: in the Earth frame, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's perspective, what is the speed of astronaut 2?

Wait, no. Wait: astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as astronaut 1, who is moving at 0.6c. So from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 would be moving at (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of astronaut 2 in Earth frame (0.5c), and v is the speed of astronaut 1 (0.6c). Wait,
