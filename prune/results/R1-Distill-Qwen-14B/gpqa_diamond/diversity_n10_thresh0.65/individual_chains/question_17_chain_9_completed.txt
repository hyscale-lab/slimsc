Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The question says we've got a solution with 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, right, EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so it's a 1:1 complex because Ca²+ has a +2 charge and EDTA^4- would pair with it, so the formula is probably CaY²-.

The formation constant, K, is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. But wait, the question is about the concentration of free Ca²+ in solution.

Oh, right! The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaY²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). But wait, sometimes people use the dissociation approach. Let me think. Alternatively, the dissociation would be CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

In that case, the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/K. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. And we're to find [Ca²+], assuming that the pH is ideal. Oh wait, pH affects the concentration of EDTA^4- because EDTA has multiple ionizable groups, but the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe the concentration of EDTA^4- is at its maximum? Wait, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is 100% present as EDTA^4-? Or maybe that the pH is such that the fraction of EDTA in the Y^4- form is 1. Hmm, but I'm not given the alpha value for EDTA. Wait, the problem might be assuming that EDTA is entirely in the Y^4- form. Or maybe we don't need to consider that because the pH is ideal, so the solution is buffered such that all EDTA is Y^4-.

Wait, but the question is about [Ca²+] in solution. So [Ca²+] is the free ion concentration. Since the complex is mostly dissociated or not? Wait, K is large (5e10), so Kd is small (2e-11), meaning that the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [Ca²+] would be very low.

Wait, but let's model it. Let me set up the equations. The dissociation is CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

The Kd is 1/(K) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

At equilibrium, [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x, where x is the amount of dissociated Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But since Kd is so small, x should be much smaller than 0.02, so [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So, Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY²-] ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² /0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*1e-13, sqrt is 2*1e-6.5. Oh wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So yes, x = 2e-6.5 M. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The Kd is 2e-11. So using x^2/(0.02) = 2e-11, so x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = about 6.32e-7. That's correct.

So the correct option is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([CaY^{2-}]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since \( K_d \) is very small, the dissociation is minimal). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).**
