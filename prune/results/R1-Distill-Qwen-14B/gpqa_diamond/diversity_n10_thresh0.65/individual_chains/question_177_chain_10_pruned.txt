Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same mass ratio. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, so mass might not directly come into play here unless it's about something else like temperature through other factors. I remember that luminosity depends on radius and temperature—specifically, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, but since we're dealing with ratios, the constants might cancel out.

The question also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait! The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Oh, right! Radial velocity is the component of a star's velocity along our line of sight. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, does that affect its observed temperature?

Hmm. Oh, because of the Doppler effect. When a star moves towards or away from us, the wavelengths of its emitted light get shifted. The Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, no, more accurately, v_r is the velocity along the line of sight. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, and the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If moving towards, blueshifted, so observed wavelength is shorter.

In this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So for Star_2
