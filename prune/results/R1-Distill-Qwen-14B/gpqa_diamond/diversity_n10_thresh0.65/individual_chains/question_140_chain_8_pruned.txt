Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry question. Let me read it carefully and think through each part step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y, which releases Gas W and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, a product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, the reaction between X and Y is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each W molecule has equal protons and neutrons. That suggests W might be a noble gas, because noble gases have complete valence shells, so maybe something like helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), etc. Let me think about their proton and neutron counts. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in its stable isotope, so that fits. Neon has 10 protons. Its most common isotope is Ne-20, which has 10 neutrons. So 10 each, that also fits. Argon has 18 protons, and Ar-40 has 22 neutrons. Oh wait, 18 and 22 don't match. So maybe the gas is He, Ne, or maybe another.

Next, when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms. G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Let me think: 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So what substance melts near that temperature? Maybe something like water ice? No, water melts at 273 K (0 C). Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe liquid nitrogen? No, that's way lower. Wait, maybe it's another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is something like ammonium chloride, which decomposes upon heating? Or perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe B is an oxide or carbonate that releases gas when heated.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B, which could be a metal oxide or something else. For example, calcium carbonate decomposes upon heating to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. But then B would be CaO. The melting point of CaO is about 2570°C, which
