Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, so I need to find the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame's perspective. I remember that when objects are moving relative to each other, we use either Galilean transformations or the Lorentz transformations, depending on the velocities involved. Since v is given and c is 1, I think if v is much smaller than c, maybe Galilean is okay, but if v is comparable, then we need special relativity.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well. Because the light is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, the beam is moving toward the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam? Oh, I think that means the glass is moving in
