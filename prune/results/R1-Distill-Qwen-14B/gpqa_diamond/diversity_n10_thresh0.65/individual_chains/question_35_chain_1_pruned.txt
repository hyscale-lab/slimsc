Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but I'll think through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon. They mentioned that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). So, Ay is a matrix, and φ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue a.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Hmm, I remember that S here might be related to the Pauli matrices or something similar. Let me write down the matrix S to visualize it better.

So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Sigma_y is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Oh wait, that's exactly what S is! So S is sigma_y. Because the Pauli matrices have this structure, and sigma_y indeed looks like that. So, S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay is equal to c multiplied by sigma_y. With c = h/(4π). So I can write Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But wait, since Ay is proportional to sigma_y, and sigma_y is a Hermitian matrix (since its conjugate transpose is itself), because all Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so Ay should be Hermitian as well because c is real. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay should be real numbers, not complex. So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is probably incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But if the eigenvalues are purely real, the imaginary part should be zero. So option A is out because it's talking about non-zero imaginary parts.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues should be real, so this is probably wrong.
