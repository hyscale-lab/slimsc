Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions. I remember that the boson's mass is 6 GeV, so that's important because it determines what particles it can decay into.

First, I need to recall that for a particle to decay into another pair of particles, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. That's the basic kinematic condition. So X can only decay into fermions if each of their masses is less than 3 GeV because each would need to have enough energy to match their mass. Wait, no, wait. Because the decay products are a pair of particles, like a fermion-antifermion pair. So the combined mass of the pair must be less than or equal to X's mass.

Wait, each fermion in the pair has mass m. So the pair's combined mass is 2m. So 2m <= 6 GeV. So m <= 3 GeV.

So I need to list all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's think about known fermion masses.

Electron (e): negligible, like 0.0005 GeV. Definitely less than 3 GeV.

Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV. Also way below 3.

Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 is about 3.56 GeV. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, X's mass is 6 GeV. So the pair's combined mass must be ≤6 GeV. So 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV. So for tau, 1.78 is ≤3, so 2*1.78 is 3.56, which is ≤6. So tau can be a decay product.

What about the quarks? Let's think about their masses. But wait, I should be careful because the masses given in particle physics are often the current masses, and sometimes for lighter quarks, the masses are approximate and depend on the energy scale. But for this problem, probably the masses of the up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top qu
