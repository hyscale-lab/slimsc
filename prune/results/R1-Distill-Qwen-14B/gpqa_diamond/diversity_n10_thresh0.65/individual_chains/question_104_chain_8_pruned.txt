Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune, so same mass for both planets. Both planets have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Since both planets are detected, the orbits must be inclined in such a way that we observe the Doppler shift, so their inclination angles are probably similar. But the problem doesn't mention inclination, so maybe it's the same for both or it's accounted for.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) )) Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * P)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (2π) ) ) ) * something. Maybe I should write it properly.

I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/1) * (1/(2π)) ) * ( ( (M_star + M_p) ) / (M_p^2) )^(1/3) ) Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall properly.

Alternatively, the formula for the semi-amplitude is:

K = ( ( (G * T) / (2π) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

Wait,
