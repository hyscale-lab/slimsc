Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying a chemical formula based on some spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out step by step.

The question gives me four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to find out which one it is using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks in that region are typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. That's interesting. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak which makes me think of carbonyl groups. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic system.

Wait, but the 1650 region is also where esters or maybe conjugated double bonds (like in alkenes) might absorb. But the presence of two carbonyl peaks... Hmm. Wait, no, wait. 1700 is a carbonyl, but 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch) or another carbonyl, perhaps. But wait, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have two carbonyls? No,
