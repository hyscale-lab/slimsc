Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I remember that the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their star, blocking some light. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the radial velocity method. RV gives the minimum mass, but in this case, both have the same mass, so that's not a variable here.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. That means Planet_1 is orbiting closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit radius.

Both have circular orbits. So no eccentricity to worry about. That simplifies things a bit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. More massive stars are usually larger, but if Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius, it must be hotter or younger? Or perhaps it's an evolved star, but the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Oh right, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, meaning it's maybe a subgiant or something, but both stars have same radius. So same radius for both stars.

Now, the probability of transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the alignment. But since both have same mass, but we don't know their radii. Wait, no, the question doesn't give their radii. Hmm, but wait—wait, the question says we know the masses and radii of the host stars. So we have R1 and R2 for the stars, which are equal.

Wait, the probability formula for transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/R_s)), but I might be mixing up something. Or is it the other way around? I think the probability P is approximately (R_p)/(a) * (something else). Wait, no, I think the formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a/R_s) * sin i )) ), but that's getting complicated. Wait
