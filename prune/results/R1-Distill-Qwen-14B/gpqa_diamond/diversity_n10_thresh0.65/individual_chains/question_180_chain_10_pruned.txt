Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, we're probably looking at the electrostatic potential energy.

Wait, but all the charges are identical. So each has a charge of 2e. 13 in total. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P.

Wait, no. Wait, the 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So the 13th is at the center, and the 12 are arranged around it, each 2 meters away.

So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges, but since the 13th is fixed, maybe we're only considering the potential due to the 12 charges relative to the 13th.

Wait, but when you have multiple charges, the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each of the 12 charges, we can compute their potential energy due to the 13th (fixed) charge, and then also consider the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait a minute, but the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P. So the distance between any two of them would be... Well, if they're all at the same distance from P, their arrangement would determine the distance between each other. But the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P; does that mean they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters? If so, the distance between any two would depend on the angle between them. But if the problem is considering the minimum energy, perhaps the charges
