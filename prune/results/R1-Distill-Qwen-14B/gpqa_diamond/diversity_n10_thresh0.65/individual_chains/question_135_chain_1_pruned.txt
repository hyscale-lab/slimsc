Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about boson decay. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but maybe I don't need to focus on that right now. I think the key here is to figure out which fermions can be produced when X decays.

First, I remember that in particle physics, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the energy of the boson must be at least twice the rest mass of each fermion. So the mass of the boson (6 GeV) has to be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into.

So I need to list all the possible fermions that have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. Let me recall the masses of the known fermions.

Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV.
Muon (mu-): around 0.105 GeV.
Tau (tau-): approximately 1.777 GeV.
Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t).

Wait, the top quark is really heavy. Its mass is about 173 GeV, so way beyond 3 GeV. So top quarks are out of the question for decay products here.

The bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV. Wait, that's already more than 3 GeV. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up the masses. Let me get the numbers right.

Wait, no. Wait, the mass of the bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV? If that's the case, then 2*m(b) would be 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into a pair of b quarks because 6 GeV isn't enough. So b quarks are out. So that rules out any options that include b bbar.

Wait wait, wait. Another possibility: perhaps the quark masses are considered in a certain way. Maybe the problem assumes that the fermion masses are negligible compared to the boson mass. No, wait, that's not the case when considering kinematic limits. Because even if the fermion mass is much smaller, the threshold is when the boson mass is just enough to produce the pair. So the minimum mass is twice the fermion mass.

But let's get the correct masses. Let me think:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (so 2m_e ~ 0.001 GeV, way below 6 GeV)
Muon: ~0.105 GeV (2m_mu ~ 0.21 GeV)
Tau: ~1.777 GeV (2m_tau ~ 3.554 GeV)
Up quark: ~2 MeV (so about 0.00
