Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about three different Michael addition reactions, and I need to determine the products A, B, and C based on the given reactants and conditions. Then, I have to match these products with the options provided.

First, let me recall what a Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is typically an enolate, and the electrophilic part is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. The result is a new carbon-carbon bond formation at the beta position.

Wait, but the problem statement actually says that when a nucleophile attacks the beta position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. And when the nucleophile is an enolate, it's called the Michael reaction. So in each of these cases, the addition is a Michael addition.

Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). Conditions are probably basic since NaOEt is a strong base, so it should deprotonate something.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH-, but wait, more accurately, it's CH2(CO2Me)2. It's a diethyl or dimethyl ester of malonic acid. So, it's a good source of an enolate. Under basic conditions like NaOEt, the alpha hydrogens are abstracted, forming an enolate.

The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but substituted at the 3-position with a p-tolyl group. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait no, E-configuration is important. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, wait, nomenclature can be tricky.

Actually, wait the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl
