Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through step by step.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters and asks which can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key here is understanding the observing capabilities of each spectrograph.

From the question, I know that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So stars with V mag <=17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. HIRES, on the other hand, can handle stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V mag <=16 can be detected by HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Oh, right, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, that's confusing. Because in astronomy, when we say a star is brighter, it has a lower apparent magnitude. So a star with V=15 is brighter than V=17.

Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So stars that have apparent V less than or equal to 17 can be observed. Because if a star is brighter, it has a lower magnitude. So if the magnitude is 17 or less, it's bright enough for ESPRESSO. Similarly for HIRES, stars with V <=16 can be observed.

Wait, no, perhaps I should clarify: The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V brighter than 17 mag. So that's V <17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because, the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star's V magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17, so it can be observed. So ESPRESSO can observe V up to 17. HIRES up to V=16.

So for a star to be observable by both, it must have V <=16, since HIRES can't go beyond that. Because if a star is, say, V=16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16.

Wait, let me read the question again. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, for ESPRESSO, V mag <17, and for HIRES, V mag <16.

Wait, no. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it: "ESPRESSO ... can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag." So, stars with apparent V mag less than 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16, so V <16.

So, both spectrographs can observe a star only if its V mag is less than 16. Because if a star is V=16.5, it's too faint for HIRES but okay for ESPRESSO. But for both to work, the star must be <=16.

So the first thing I need to do is compute the apparent V magnitude of each star, considering any extinction (which is given for some stars).

Wait, the stars' parameters are given in various forms. Some give absolute magnitude and distance, others give apparent magnitude. Some have extinction (E(B-V)), which affects V magnitude.

So for each star, I need to compute the apparent V magnitude.

Let me go through each star.
