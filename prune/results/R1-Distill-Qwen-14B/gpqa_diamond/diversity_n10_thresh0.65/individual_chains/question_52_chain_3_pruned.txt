Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Now, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio goes down. Let me think: when the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio?

Suppose we have level 1 at a lower energy than level 2. So E1 < E2. Then, the exponent is negative because (E1 - E2) is negative. So, the exponential becomes exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). As temperature decreases, this exponent increases, so the ratio n1/n2 (since E2 is higher) would decrease. So if the ratio is n1/n2, a lower temperature makes that ratio smaller, which matches the problem statement. So the ratio they are considering is n1/n2.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. If I'm considering the ratio of level 1 to level 2, which is n1/n2. The Boltzmann equation says n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1}.

Wait, no, better to write it as n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then as T decreases, the exponent -(ΔE)/(k T) becomes more negative, which makes the exponential term smaller. So n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. That's exactly what happens when spots are present. So the ratio being observed is n1/n2, and it's decreasing when T_eff drops. So when spots are present, the overall T is lower, and the ratio is lower.

We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So we need to compute (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

So, let's model that. Let's denote R as the ratio n1
