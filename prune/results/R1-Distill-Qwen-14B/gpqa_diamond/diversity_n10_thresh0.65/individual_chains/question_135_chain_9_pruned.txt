Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this particle physics problem. Hmm. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, the interaction term. So, this is a Yukawa-like interaction, right? Because Yukawa coupling terms usually look like λ ψ ψ X or something similar. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find out what fermions it can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

Wait, but in particle decays, the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because when a particle at rest decays, the fermions (which are created from the boson) need to have enough energy to reach their rest mass. So, for each fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, but fermions come in pairs, like a quark and antiquark, or a lepton and antilepton. So the threshold is 2m_fermion <= m_X.

So, m_X is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of the known fermions. Quarks: up, down are light, maybe around ~2-5 MeV each. Strange is about 100 MeV. Charm is around 1.5 GeV. Bottom is around 4.5 GeV. Top is about 173 GeV. For leptons: electrons are ~0.5 MeV, mu around 105 MeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. Neutrinos are negligible.

So, possible fermions that X can decay into are those where 2m_fermion <=6 GeV.

Let me go through each option and see which fermions fit.

First, for quarks:

- up quark: m_u ~2 MeV. 2m_u ~4 MeV <<6 GeV. So X can decay into uū.
Same with d quark. So uū and dđ are allowed.

s quark: m_s ~100 MeV. 2m_s ~0.2 GeV <6 GeV. So sŝ is allowed.

c quark: m_c ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c =3 GeV <=6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed.

b quark: m_b ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b=9 GeV. Oh wait, 9 GeV is bigger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 4.5*2=9>6. So b is out.

t quark: m_t is about 173 GeV, way too big. So can't decay into t tbar.

Now for leptons:

e+ e-: m_e ~0.
