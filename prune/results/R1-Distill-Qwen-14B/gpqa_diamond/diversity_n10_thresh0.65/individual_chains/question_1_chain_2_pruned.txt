Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to its energy uncertainty. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! So the principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/(2π), maybe? Or is it ħ/2? I think for the uncertainty principle, it's usually written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, but maybe the exact factor varies depending on the source. But I'll proceed with the general idea.

The question states that the two states have lifetimes of 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Oh wait, actually, the lifetimes are the time uncertainties, Δt1 and Δt2? Or is it the same for both? No, wait, each state has its own lifetime. But I think the energy difference between the two states is what matters for their distinguishability.

Wait, the problem is about being able to clearly resolve two energy levels. So, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't distinguish them—like they'd blur together.

So to resolve them, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty given by the Heisenberg principle for each. Wait, but each state has its own energy uncertainty. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the minimum energy difference each state allows and then see which option is larger than both.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE_i = ħ / (2 * Δt_i), right? So for each state, the uncertainty is ħ/(2Δt) for that state.

But in this case, the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 > E1) is ΔE = E2 - E1.

To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the uncertainty for each should be smaller than ΔE, so that they can be distinguished. Wait, maybe the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty of each state's energy.

Wait, but each state's lifetime is given. So for state 1, Δt1 = 1e-9 sec, so ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1). Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2). So to
