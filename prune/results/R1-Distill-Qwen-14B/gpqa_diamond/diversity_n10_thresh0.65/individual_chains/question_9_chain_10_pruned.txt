Okay, so I've got this question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but let's think this through. The options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two other complex molecules. Oh wait, the options are A to D, with each being one of those molecules. 

First, I need to recall what C3h symmetry means. From what I remember, symmetry elements include rotation and reflection. C3h is a point group. The 'C3' part means a three-fold rotation axis, and the 'h' indicates a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane.

Looking at each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves, each is a CH2CH(CH3)2, so the molecule around the B atom would have three identical groups. That suggests a trigonal planar arrangement, which would have a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Wait, in triisopropyl borate, the structure is trigonal pyramidal? Or is it trigonal planar? Wait, no. Boron usually has three bonds in compounds like borate esters. So each isopropyl is connected to B. So the molecule has three identical substituents. So for symmetry, it's likely to have a C3 axis. 

But wait, what's the geometry? Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule? Or maybe trigonal pyramidal? I think it's more planar, like trigonal planar because each substituent is a bulky group. So if it's trigonal planar, then yes, it has a C3 axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the central atom and a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. In a trigonal planar molecule, would that be the case? Wait, for a trigonal planar, the mirror planes would be the three planes that each contain the central atom and a mirror image of the substituents. But in C3h, there's only one horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no. Let me think again. The point group C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a single horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. So for triisopropyl borate, if it's trigonal planar, does it have a mirror plane? I think it does. Because each substituent is the same, any plane that goes through the boron and bisects two substituents would be a mirror plane. But wait, for a trigonal planar molecule, like BF3, it's D3h symmetry, not C3h. Because D3h has more symmetry elements. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is not planar. Let's think about the structure. Boron is in the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is (CH2CH(CH3)2). So the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry, with each substituent pointing out. So for symmetry, it's similar to BF3, which has D3h symmetry. Wait, D3h has a C3 axis and other elements like Ïƒh
