Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem says that we're dealing with a quantum mechanical operator P, which is a vector operator. It has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvector we need is for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so that means it's in the plane where y=0. So the direction vector can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Oh right, because any direction in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the polar angle θ from the z-axis, and φ would be zero since it's in the x-z plane (so φ determines the azimuthal angle, but here it's fixed).

The operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. So when we're looking for the operator along an arbitrary direction n, the operator in that direction would be P · n. Because the operator is a vector, the component along n is given by the dot product of the vector operator with the unit vector in direction n.

Wait, so the operator in the direction n is P_n = (P · n) = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Each component of P is given. Let me write down the matrices for each component.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row (0,1) and second (1,0). So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0], [0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So, the operator P_n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Substituting the matrices, this becomes (n_x * (ħ/2) * X_matrix ) + (n_z * (ħ
