Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. So when the planet pulls the star towards us, the spectral lines shift to a shorter wavelength (blue shift), and when it's moving away, they shift to a longer wavelength (red shift). The periodic shifts indicate the planet's presence.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the main difference is the Doppler shifts observed: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So I need to find the ratio of their periods, P2/P1.

I think the key here is understanding what the RV method measures. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K), which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But in this case, the stars are identical, so their masses are the same. Also, since the orbits are circular, inclination doesn't play a role beyond the fact that it's edge-on for maximum Doppler effect. Wait, but the question doesn't mention anything about the inclination, but since both stars are observed using RV, I guess we're assuming the same inclination for both, or perhaps it's not a factor in the ratio.

Wait, actually, the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star towards us. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), and the stars are the same, the only variables here are the period and the sine of the inclination. However, in the problem, both planets have been detected, so their sin i values are non-zero. But since both are detected, perhaps we can assume that sin i is approximately the same for both, or maybe it doesn't affect the ratio because M_p and M_* are the same.

Wait, but the RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3))) ) multiplied by some constants. Since M_p and M_* are the same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). 

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, P ∝ 1 / K^(3).

Wait, let me clarify. If K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)), then rearranging gives P proportional to (1/K)^(3). Because K = constant / P^(1/3) → P^(
