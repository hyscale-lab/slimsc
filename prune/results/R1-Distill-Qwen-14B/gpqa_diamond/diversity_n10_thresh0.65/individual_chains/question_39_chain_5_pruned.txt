Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, we have a large number of identical systems, 10,000 particles. Each particle is in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position of the particles, they aren't found below x=1 or above x=3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. 

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right! The wave function's square modulus must integrate to 1 over the region where the particle is found. Because the total probability must be 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait a second. That doesn't look like a standard wave function. Usually, wave functions are complex, but I thought they are normalized such that the integral of |ψ|^2 dx equals 1. But wait, the way it's written, it's a complex number: real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part -0.5. So ψ(x) is a constant imaginary term plus a real term depending on x. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, maybe the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some complex factor. Wait the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is 0.5. Wait, no, because the entire expression is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is [ a/(sqrt(1+x)) ] + ( -0.5 ) * i.

But that would mean that the imaginary part is a constant, which is -0.5 times i. That seems a bit odd because usually, the wave function's real and imaginary parts are functions that depend on x. But perhaps in this problem, it's given as such.

Wait, but when you square
