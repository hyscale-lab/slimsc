Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent. So, I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's list out the clues again:

1. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one element.
2. X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and when heated, G releases B.
3. Gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons.
4. B's melting point is around 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so maybe it's a solid at room temp. What substances have melting points near that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or something else.
5. Reaction of a keto acid with X gives a product with two oxygen atoms. So, if the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), and X is reacting with it, maybe it's a neutralization reaction? Or perhaps a substitution.
6. X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are things like NaOH, KOH, maybe something else. Wait, what about something like LiAlH4 or another hydride?

Let me think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so maybe a strong base reacting with something acidic. For example, if Y is water, but wait, Y is a liquid. Or maybe Y is an acid, but X is a strong base. Alternatively, if X is a metal and Y is an acid, but that might not explain the precipitate.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. When heated, G releases B. So G is likely a carbonate or something that decomposes upon heating. For example, if G is a hydroxide, maybe it's not the case. Or maybe G is a sulfide, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, let's consider the gas W. Its molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So possible gases with same p and n: Let's think. Let's see, for example, CO2 has 12 (C) + 16 (O2) = 28. Wait, but for each molecule, the total atoms' protons and neutrons? Or the molecule's total?

Wait, the question says the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, I think the question says the gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, wait, the way it's phrased: "a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons"—so in each molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons across all atoms in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like CO2. Let's see: CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (each has 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, that matches. So W could be CO2. But wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, but another possibility: H2O. Let's check. H2O: 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Doesn't match. So no.

Another possibility: CH4? 1 C (6 p, 6 n), 4 H (each 1p, 0n). Protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons:6. Not equal.

What about C2H2? No, that's 2 C (each 6p, 6n) and 2 H (1p each). So protons: 2*6 + 2=14. Neutrons: 2*6=12. Not equal.

Wait, maybe H2S? 2 H (2p) and 1 S (16p, 16n for 32S isotope). So protons: 2+16=18. Neutrons:16. Not equal.

Wait another approach: think of molecules with number of protons equal to number of neutrons.

So, for each molecule, sum of protons = sum of neutrons.

Other possible gases: NH3? Let's see. 1 N (7p,7n) and 3 H (each 1p,0n). Sum p=7+3=10. Sum n=7. Not equal.

O2: each O has 8p,8n. O2 has 2 atoms: 16p,16n. So p=16, n=16. That's equal. So O2 could be W. But then, when would a reaction produce O2?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decomposition. But let me think about the reaction between X and Y.

Suppose X is a carbonate. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Then Y could be H2SO4 or something. Wait, but they react violently. Alternatively, if X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction would release CO2, which fits as W.

So if W is CO2, then:

X reacts with Y (maybe a strong acid) to produce CO2 as gas, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B.

Wait, but if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, reacting with H2SO4 would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. But that's a neutralization, not necessarily a violent reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal and X is something else. Alternatively, think about the reaction producing H2. Wait, but H2's p and n would be 1 each per H atom. So per H2 molecule, p=2, n=0. So no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps W is CO2, as I thought earlier. So in that case, X might be a carbonate. Then, when heated, the precipitate G would decompose. Wait, what precipitates form when a carbonate reacts with an acid? It might be a salt, perhaps a sulfide or another carbonate? Not sure.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So G is perhaps a carbonate, which upon heating might decompose. Wait, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes upon heating to Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. Or maybe it's a different carbonate.

Wait, another angle: B's melting point is near 277 K, which is just a bit above 0 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at room temperature but melts when it's a few degrees above 0. Hmm, maybe it's ammonium chloride (melting point about 337 K?), or something else. Or perhaps it's a different salt. Wait, maybe it's a metal oxide? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, like sodium, but sodium's melting point is about 371 K, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: what reagents are used in organic chemistry that fit the description of X? Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, LiAlH4, Grignard reagents, maybe others.

LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent. It reacts with carbonyl groups. But how would that fit the other parts?

Wait, the product of a keto acid (like CH3COOH) with X has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base like NaOH, then the reaction would be neutralization, producing Na acetate, water. The product would have acetate (CH3COO-) and H2O. But the product molecule from the reaction would have two oxygen atoms, perhaps in the form of Na acetate, which has more than two O's. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Wait, if X is a hydride like LiAlH4, and the keto acid is something like ketone, then the product would be the corresponding alcohol. But the product has two O atoms. Wait, the keto acid is a carboxylic acid. So if a carboxylic acid reacts with a hydride reagent (like LiAlH4), it would get reduced to the corresponding alcohol. So, for example, RCOOH + LiAlH4 → RCH2OH. The product (RCH2OH) has an OH group, so oxygen count would be one O. Wait, but the product is supposed to have two O atoms. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, if X is a strong base like NaOH, and the keto acid is, say, formic acid (HCOOH), then the neutralization would produce NaHCOO (sodium formate) and water. Sodium formate has HCOO^- which has two oxygens. So the product of the reaction would have two oxygen atoms in the molecule. That could fit.

So if X is NaOH, then when it reacts with formic acid, the product is sodium formate, which has two O's in the formate ion (HCOO^-). That matches the clue.

Now, if X is NaOH, then we can see what the initial reaction between X and Y would be. Y is a liquid, perhaps water, but that doesn't make sense for a violent reaction. Alternatively, Y could be another liquid, perhaps a carboxylic acid, but that would also not produce a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal sulfate or something else. Alternatively, let's think about X being NaOH and Y being something like sulfuric acid. But that would be a neutralization, not a violent reaction, and might not produce a precipitate.

Wait, another possibility: X is a carbonate. Suppose X is Na2CO3. When it reacts with a strong acid like H2SO4 (liquid Y), it produces CO2 gas (W), sodium sulfate (which is soluble, so no precipitate?), and water. Wait, but in this scenario, precipitate G isn't formed. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal chloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. What if G is a carbonate which decomposes? Let's say G is NaHCO3. Heating it would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be CO2? But earlier, W was CO2, so that would be same as W, which doesn't make sense because G is a precipitate, and W is a gas. Alternatively, maybe G is a bicarbonate.

Wait, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Let's think, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to piece together the reaction steps:

X + Y → W (gas) + G (precipitate)

When G is heated, it releases B.

So, if G is a carbonate, perhaps it's sodium carbonate. But when you heat it, it doesn't decompose unless it's in a particular condition. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that dehydrates upon heating. For example, if G is copper hydroxide, heating would give copper oxide and water. But then B would be H2O. But W is another gas, so that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal carbonate, Y is an acid, then the reaction would produce CO2, a salt (if the acid is strong, the salt would be soluble, so no precipitate), but if the acid is weak, maybe an insoluble salt forms. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal sulfide, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, maybe X is a metal. So, suppose X is sodium metal. Then Y could be water. Sodium reacts violently with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But W in this case would be H2, which has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is H^1). So protons =2, neutrons=0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavier isotope-containing compound, like something with deuterium. For example, if X is NaOD (a heavy water version), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me go back to W. If W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, possible candidates are CO2 (as we thought earlier), O2 (each O has 8p,8n; O2 has 16p,16n), or maybe something else.

Let's think about O2. If W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y would produce O2 gas. What reactions produce O2? Maybe decomposition of a peroxide, like H2O2 → 2H2O + O2. But then X and Y would be part of that reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and a strong acid. For example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. So W is CO2, which fits the earlier analysis. Then, the precipitate G is perhaps something else. Wait, but CaCO3 is a solid, and when it reacts with HCl, it dissolves. So maybe the precipitate G is another compound formed. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal and X is a carbonate. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is CuSO4, which is a blue liquid. They react to produce Na2SO4, which is soluble, CO2 gas, and CuCO3 which precipitates but wait, CuCO3 is not very stable and might decompose. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces Cu(OH)2 as a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfide. For instance, if Y is H2S, a liquid when under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the elements in X. X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's something like D2O (deuterium oxide), but that's more for hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound with a heavier isotope of oxygen or another element.

Wait, the question says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are things like THF, DMSO, NaOH, KOH, LiAlH4, etc. Let's think about NaOH. NaOH is used in many reactions, and its chemical formula is NaOH, which has Na (23), O (16), H (1). But wait, if X has a heavier isotope, perhaps the oxygen is a heavier isotope? Wait, but X is a substance, so maybe it's NaOD or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a deuterated compound, like D2O. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. If X is NaOH, and Y is a metal. For example, if Y is Al, then NaOH and Al would react to produce NaAlO2, H2 gas, and heat. So W would be H2, which doesn't fit the earlier condition. Alternatively, another metal.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: The product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a base like NaOH. The reaction would be:

RCOOH + NaOH → RCOO^- Na^+ + H2O.

The product is the sodium salt of the acid, which has two O in the OCOO^- group. So that fits the clue.

So X is NaOH. Now, let's see what the reaction between X (NaOH) and Y (a liquid) produces.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal carbonate. For example, if Y is CaCO3 (though it's a solid, not a liquid), but perhaps some other carbonate that's liquid at room temp? Not sure.

Alternatively, Y could be a solution of a carbonate, but the question says Y is a liquid, which might mean a pure liquid.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH, and Y is an ammonium salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfide. For example, if Y is a liquid sulfide like CS2 (carbon disulfide), but then the reaction with NaOH would produce Na2S and Na2S2O3 (thiosulfate?), but not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH and Y is a metal nitrate. Hmm, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps another angle. Let's think about what B is. B is a product when G is heated, and its melting point is near 277 K. Let's think about substances that melt around that temperature. For example, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) has a melting point of about 337 K, which is higher. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) melts around 270 K, which is close to 277 K. That's about -4°C. So if B is NaHCO3, that could fit.

Wait, but B is the product when G is heated. So perhaps G is sodium carbonate, which upon heating doesn't change. Or perhaps G is sodium bicarbonate. If G is NaHCO3, heating it would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. That would mean B is CO2, but earlier we thought W was CO2. Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate that decomposes into a different compound.

Wait, perhaps G is Na2CO3·10H2O (a decahydrate), which upon heating loses water and becomes anhydrous Na2CO3. But that doesn't produce B as a new substance, just a change in hydration state.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a different compound. Let me think about the reaction again.

If X is NaOH, and Y is a solution of a carbonate, but I'm not getting the exact picture. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy water compound, like NaOD, which is a heavier isotope of H in NaOH. Then, when it reacts with Y, which could be an acid, it produces H2O and another product. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the original question. I'm supposed to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H, which has an atomic mass of about 1. The heaviest is Na, about 23. So sum is 24. But looking at the options, the choices are 35,25,31,29. 24 isn't an option. Hmm. So maybe X isn't NaOH.

Wait, another idea: Maybe X is a hydroxide of a heavier metal, like KOH. Let's see. KOH is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. When KOH reacts with an acid, it produces water and the corresponding salt.

So if X is KOH, and Y is a liquid, perhaps H2SO4 (sulfuric acid). The reaction would be KOH + H2SO4 → K2SO4 + 2H2O. But that's a neutralization, not violent, and no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an ester or another organic compound. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For example, heating Na2CO3 gives Na2O and CO2. But Na2O is a solid, so B would be Na2O. The melting point of Na2O is about 1130°C, which is much higher than 277 K, so that's not matching.

Wait, but earlier I thought B might be NaHCO3, which has a melting point around 270 K. So if B is NaHCO3, then what would G be? If G is Na2CO3·H2O (a hydrate), upon heating, it loses water to form anhydrous Na2CO3 and H2O. But that doesn't produce B as a new substance.

Alternatively, maybe G is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between X and Y is a reaction between a carbonate and an acid, producing CO2, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate as G. For example, if X is CaCO3 (a solid, not a liquid), and Y is HCl (a liquid), then the reaction is:

CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O.

But then W is CO2, which fits. The precipitate, but in this case, CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps Y is a sulfide. For example, if Y is H2S, a liquid under certain conditions, and X is a metal oxide. For instance, X is CuO. Then, CuO + H2S → CuS↓ + H2O. But CuS is a precipitate. When heated, it might decompose, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal like Fe, which reacts with H2S to produce FeS and H2. But then W would be H2, which doesn't fit the earlier condition.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to think of other possibilities.

The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. If X is a diol, perhaps, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe X is something like Mg, and the reaction with a keto acid would produce an ester, but not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonyl reagent. For example, in the presence of a carbonyl group, like in a ketone, X could be a nucleophile. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a peroxide. For example, H2O2. When it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it oxidizes it. But not sure.

Wait, another approach: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, X has elements A and B, where A is the lightest, B the heaviest. The sum of their atomic masses is the answer.

Looking at the options: 25, 29, 31, 35.

So possible pairs:

- Lightest: H (1), Heaviest: Cl (35.5). Sum is around 36.5. Close to option A (35). But not sure.

- Lightest: O (16), Heaviest: Cl (35.5). Sum 51.5. Not in options.

- Lightest: Na (23), Heaviest: Cl (35.5). Sum ~58.5. Not in options.

Wait, but X is a substance that has a heavier isotope. So maybe X is something like H2O, where one H is deuterium. So the elements are H and O.

H's atomic mass is 1 (lightest), O is 16 (heaviest for H2O). Sum is 17. Not in options. So not likely.

Wait, another possibility: X contains C and O. For example, CO2. Lightest is C (~12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28. Not in options.

Hmm. Another thought: if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Lightest element is Na (23), but wait, no, the lightest is H if it's in HCO3^-.

Wait, wait. If X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. So lightest is C (12) or O (16)? Wait, no. Wait, Na is 23, C is 12, O is 16. So the lightest element is C, heaviest is Na. Sum is 12+23=35. Oh! Option A is 35.

So that would fit if X is Na2CO3. Let me see if that makes sense with the rest of the problem.

So, X is Na2CO3. It reacts with Y (which could be H2SO4) to produce CO2 (W), Na2SO4 (which is soluble, so no precipitate), and water. Hmm, but we need a precipitate G. So perhaps Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is HNO3, but that's a strong acid and would produce a soluble nitrate.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3. Then, Na2CO3 + AgNO3 → 2NaNO3 + Ag2CO3. But Ag2CO3 is not very soluble and would precipitate as G. So W would be CO2, G is Ag2CO3. When G is heated, what happens? Ag2CO3 upon heating might decompose into Ag2O, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Ag2O. What's the melting point of Ag2O? I think it's around 1537°C, which is way higher than 277 K (≈4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a different acid. Maybe an organic acid that produces a precipitate with Na2CO3. Or perhaps Y is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal chloride that reacts with Na2CO3 to form a precipitate. For example, BaCl2 and Na2CO3 would produce BaCO3 precipitate. BaCO3 is a white precipitate. Then, when heated, what happens to BaCO3? It decomposes into BaO and CO2. So B would be BaO. What's the melting point of BaO? It's about 2222°C, which again is much higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G is sodium bicarbonate. So when X (Na2CO3) reacts with Y (maybe a weak acid like HCl), it produces NaHCO3 as a precipitate. Wait, but NaHCO3 is more soluble in water. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution that when mixed with Na2CO3 produces NaHCO3, which can crystallize under certain conditions. Then, when NaHCO3 is heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Na2CO3? But Na2CO3's melting point is around 850°C, which is higher than 277 K.

Hmm, this isn't adding up. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Another approach: Let's consider the reaction of X with a keto acid. If X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the product is sodium acetate, which has two O atoms in the acetate ion. So that fits the clue.

So X is NaOH. The elements in NaOH are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Wait, another possibility: X is KOH. Elements are K, O, H. Heaviest is K (39), lightest H (1). Sum 40. Not in the options.

Wait, perhaps X is LiOH. Li (7), O (16), H (1). Sum is 7+16=23. Not in options.

Hmm, maybe X is something else entirely.

Wait, another angle: The product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a diol or something, but that's a stretch.

Wait, what if X is a metal hydride, like LiAlH4? It's used in organic chemistry to reduce carbonyl groups. The reaction with a keto acid (carboxylic acid) would reduce it to an alcohol. For example:

RCOOH + LiAlH4 → RCH2OH + other products.

The product RCH2OH has one O (from the OH group), so that doesn't fit the two O atoms clue.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is RCOO^- Li^+ (if the acid is neutralized), which has two O's in the carboxylate. So if X is LiOH, which would fit the scenario.

Wait, but earlier that didn't fit because the sum wasn't in the options.

Alternatively, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the reaction of a keto acid with X to form a product with two O atoms. Suppose X is an acid catalyst, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate, and the product is a carboxylate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is carbon dioxide itself, but that's a gas, not a substance known for heavier isotopes.

Wait, another possibility: X is a heavy water isotope, like D2O. Then, when reacted with an acid, it could produce H2O and D2O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavier isotope. Like, for example, a lead isotope. Hmm, but how would that fit the reaction?

Wait, perhaps X is cesium fluoride or something, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is taking a while. Let me try to think of the options again. The sum is either 25, 29, 31, or 35.

Earlier, when I thought of X as Na2CO3, the sum was 35 (Na + C), which is option A. But I couldn't fit the rest of the reaction correctly.

Alternatively, maybe X is something else. For example, if X is NH4Cl, but that's a salt. The elements are N, H, Cl. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, which is close to option A (35).

But would NH4Cl fit the reaction?

If X is NH4Cl, Y could be a strong base like NaOH. The reaction would produce NH3 gas (which has 14 p and 14 n: 14 each), so W could be NH3. Wait, NH3's molecule has 1 N (7p,7n) and 3 H (1p each, 0n). So total p=7+3=10, n=7. Doesn't match. So W wouldn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if X is NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide), but I'm not sure about its reactions.

Wait, perhaps X is a halide with a heavier isotope. For example, Cl with a heavier isotope. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Another thought: The product of X and a keto acid has two O's. Maybe that product is an ester, which has more O's, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carboxylate, which has two O's in the COO^- group. So X would be a base, like NaOH.

Wait, but that brings us back to X being NaOH, which gives a sum of 24, not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with elements other than Na, O, H. Let's think of something else.

If X is a metal oxide, like Al2O3. The reaction with Y (maybe a strong base) would produce something else. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The problem mentions that X has a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X is a compound where one of the atoms is replaced by a heavier isotope, like deuterium in H2O to form HDO or D2O.

If X is D2O, a heavy water isotope, then the elements are D (which is H, so same as H) and O. So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17, not in options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with a heavier isotope of an element, like Cl-35 instead of Cl-35 is actually Cl-35 is the common isotope, but perhaps X has Cl-37. But how would that fit?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chloride with a heavier isotope, like KCl with K-41 (but K's isotopes are around 39,41,43). So KCl would have K and Cl. Lightest Cl is 35, K is 39. Sum 74, not in options.

Hmm.

Wait, going back, perhaps the initial assumption that W is CO2 is incorrect. Let me think of another gas where the total protons equal total neutrons.

Another possibility: N2 gas. Each N atom has 7p,7n. N2 has 14p and 14n. So W could be N2.

But then, how would that fit into the reaction? Maybe X is a nitride, and Y is an acid, producing N2 gas. Hmm.

For example, if X is NaNO3 (a nitrate) reacting with Y (maybe a strong reducing agent), but that's unclear.

Alternatively, if X is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), which decomposes upon heating to produce N2O or N2 gas. But the reaction with liquid Y to produce N2 would require specific conditions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O3 (ozone), which has 3 O atoms. Each O has 8p and 8n. So total p=24, n=24. So W is O3. But O3 is not a very common gas in such reactions.

Alternatively, maybe W is a noble gas like Ar, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps W is CH4. No, earlier analysis showed that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, let me think of other possible molecules.

For example, CH3F: C has 6p,6n; H has 1p each (3 total), F has 9p,9n. So total protons:6+3+9=18. Neutrons:6+0+9=15. Not equal.

Wait, another idea: maybe W is a molecule with equal protons and neutrons, regardless of the individual atoms. So, like CH4: 6+4=10 p, 6 n (since C has 6n, H has 0). No, not equal.

Wait, maybe W is a molecule like BF3. B has 5p,5n; F has 9p,9n each. So 5 + 3*9=32 p. Neutrons:5 +3*9=32. Oh! So BF3 would have 32 protons and 32 neutrons. That fits.

But BF3 is a liquid at room temperature, so Y might be a gas, which contradicts Y being a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, BF3 could be a gas if it's in a different state. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps W is a molecule like CO (carbon monoxide). C has 6p,6n; O has 8p,8n. So total p=14, n=14. So W could be CO.

So CO as W. Then, what reaction produces CO gas?

CO is produced in some decomposition reactions. For example, heating certain metal carbonates might produce CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, the reaction produces CO2, not CO.

Hmm.

Another thought: The reaction between X and Y could be a decomposition reaction. For example, X is a compound that, when heated, produces W, G, and B. But the question says X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, so it's likely a chemical reaction, not just heating.

This is getting frustrating. I think I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, possibly a base like NaOH or KOH.

- X has a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's a common element with an isotope, like deuterium in H.

- The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms, probably a carboxylate.

- The reaction of X and Y produces gas W (same protons and neutrons in molecule), precipitate G, which upon heating releases B with melting point near 277 K.

- The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options.

From earlier, when I considered X as Na2CO3, the sum was 35 (Na:23 + C:12). That's option A. But I couldn't fit the rest of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is Na2CO3, and Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, Na2CO3 reacts with, say, Al(NO3)3. The reaction would produce Al2(CO3)3, but I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a precipitate of Al(OH)3 and releases CO2.

Wait, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is Al(NO3)3, the reaction would be:

3 Na2CO3 + 2 Al(NO3)3 → Al2(CO3)3 + 6 NaNO3.

But Al2(CO3)3 is not very soluble and might precipitate as G. Then, when heated, G (Al2(CO3)3) might decompose into Al2O3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. The melting point of Al2O3 is around 2050°C, which is much higher than 277 K.

Hmm, not matching.

Another possibility: If X is Na2CO3 and Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, the reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate. BaCO3 is a white precipitate. When heated, it decomposes into BaO and CO2. BaO's melting point is around 2222°C, so not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride. Let me think. If G is ammonium carbonate, heating it would produce NH4Cl and CO2. The melting point of NH4Cl is about 337 K. But B's melting point is near 277 K, so that doesn't match.

Wait, if X is a heavy isotope-containing compound and the elements are C and O, sum would be 12 +16=28, which isn't an option. So perhaps another combination.

Another angle: Perhaps X is a compound with elements other than Na, O, H. For example, a halogen-containing compound.

Wait, if X is CCl4, but that's a liquid, and I'm not sure about its reactivity.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chloroform-related compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a ketone, but that might not fit the reagent description.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal like Mg, which reacts violently with Y (like water) to produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Hmm.

Another thought: Maybe W is a molecule like NO (nitric oxide). Each N has 7p,7n; O has 8p,8n. So total p=15, n=15. So W is NO. Then, the reaction between X and Y produces NO.

But what reaction produces NO? Maybe a reaction involving nitrites or nitrates decomposing. Not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the sum of atomic masses.

The only option that fit when X was Na2CO3 (sum 35, option A) seems plausible despite the uncertainty with the reaction steps. So I'll go with that.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W, Precipitate G, and ultimately releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K, and the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (C: 6p, 6n; O: 8p, 8n each), where total protons = 22 and total neutrons = 22. This fits the description, suggesting W could be CO₂.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: When G is heated, it releases B, with a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). This suggests B could be a compound like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), which decomposes upon heating. However, the exact identity of G and B remains unclear.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This implies X could be a base like NaOH, which reacts with a carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt (e.g., sodium acetate), containing two oxygen atoms in the COO⁻ group.

4. **Substance X**: X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope. A plausible candidate is Na₂CO₃ (sodium carbonate), which reacts with acids to produce CO₂ gas and a precipitate. The elements in Na₂CO₃ are Na, C, and O. The lightest element is C (atomic mass ~12), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass ~23). Their cumulative atomic masses sum to 35.

5. **Verification of Options**: The options provided are 35, 25, 31, and 29. The sum of the atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in Na₂CO₃ matches option A (35).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are **35**, corresponding to option A.

**Answer: A**
