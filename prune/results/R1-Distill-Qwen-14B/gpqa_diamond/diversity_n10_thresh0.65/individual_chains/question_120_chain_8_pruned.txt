Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Let me think... Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. So a star with a larger parallax is closer because it's moving more in the sky.

But the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. So it's asking about the density of stars in terms of parallax intervals. Let me visualize this. Imagine a sphere with a certain radius (distance) around the Sun. The number of stars within a thin shell at radius d would depend on the volume of that shell, I think.

Wait, the number of stars in a volume depends on the density. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number should be proportional to the volume. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. So the number of stars in a shell between d and d+dr would be proportional to d² dr.

But since the question is about parallax, and d = 1 / plx, let me express everything in terms of plx. So plx (p) is 1/d, which means d = 1/p. So dr would be the change in d when plx changes by dp. Let's compute dr in terms of dp.

Since p = 1/d, dr = - (1/d²) dp. But wait, we can ignore the negative sign because we're dealing with the magnitude. So dr = dp / p².

Now, substituting d = 1/p into the volume term. The volume of the shell is 4π (1/p)^2 * dr. But dr is dp/(p²), so substituting that in:

Volume = 4π (1/p²) * (dp/p²) ) = 4π (dp) / p^4.

But wait, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is dp. So the number per unit plx is something like N ∝ 1/p^4.

But hold on, let
