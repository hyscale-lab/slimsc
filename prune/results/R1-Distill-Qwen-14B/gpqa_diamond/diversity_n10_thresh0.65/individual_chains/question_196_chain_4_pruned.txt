Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. But this is relativistic, so I guess special relativity comes into play. 

The question asks for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. The parameters given are mass m, maximum amplitude A, and the force follows Hooke's law F = -kx. Oh right, and the speed of light is c. 

Wait, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², and that equals (1/2)mv², so solving for v gives v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so I think that formula is incorrect because it doesn't account for relativistic effects.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the setup must be different.

So the problem is about a particle oscillating in a potential, but now considering relativistic speeds. The oscillator's potential is (1/2)kx², so the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential at maximum displacement. Wait, no, at maximum amplitude A, the potential is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy would then be E = rest energy (mc²) plus kinetic. Wait, no, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy in classical mechanics is (1/2)kA², which is all potential at maximum displacement, and all kinetic at zero displacement.

But in relativity, I think the system's energy would include the rest mass energy plus the potential energy. So the total energy E would be mc² + (1/2)kA². 

At the point where the mass is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA². Wait, but relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)
