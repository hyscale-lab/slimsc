Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Alright, let me read the question again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, the β values here—I think they represent the formation constants for each complex. So, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+, the second might be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on up to the fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^2+.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ligands, so that's the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So I need to find the fraction of Co that is in this form.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution depends on the stability constants (β values) and the concentrations of the ions involved. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up to 100%.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the β values and the concentrations of the ligands. The fraction for the nth complex, f_n, is given by [β_n * [Ligand]^n] divided by the sum of all β_k * [Ligand]^k for k from 1 to 4.

Wait, but in this case, the ligand is SCN^- and Co can form complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN^- ions. So the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Wait, wait, no, because Co(II) is +2 charge. So each SCN^- is -1. So:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → charge is +2 -1 = +1; but wait, that's not possible because the overall charge would be +1, but usually, Co complexes are neutral or have other
