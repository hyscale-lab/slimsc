Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a different distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to something about the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (γ) multiplied by the mean life time τ. Or wait, maybe it's the lifetime multiplied by the speed. Let me think.

So, the mean decay distance (L) can be calculated with the formula L = γ * β * c * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime, β is the velocity over the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, how do I get τ from the given parameters?

Oh, right! The mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is Γ, and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is τ. The relation is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So, τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Wait, but I think the exact formula is τ = ħ/(Γ), because Γ is the total decay width, which is the uncertainty in energy.

So first, I need to compute τ. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, units are important here. The Planck constant ħ is usually in units of J·s, but since we're dealing with GeV and MeV, I need to convert units appropriately.

Let me jot down the constants. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. But let me double-check the value of ħ in GeV·s units. Yes, I think ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 32
