Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), second row is (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, and then determine which of the statements A to D is correct.

Wait, so first, let's get the matrix S down. So S is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0.

And c is h/(4π), so Ay is c multiplied by S. So let me write Ay as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So let me compute that matrix. Multiplying each element by c:

Each element in S is either 0, i, or -i.

So first row:
(0) * c = 0,
(-i) * c = -i h/(4π).

Second row:
(i) * c = i h/(4π),
0 * c = 0.

So Ay matrix is:

[ [ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π) , 0 ] ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to keep it symbolic for now. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue, and φ is the eigenfunction (eigenvector).

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues can be found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of S first, and then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay.

Because if S has eigenvalues λ, then Ay = c S has eigenvalues c λ.

So maybe that's an easier approach. Let's compute the eigenvalues of S.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To find eigenvalues, solve det(S - λ I) =0.

So determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-
