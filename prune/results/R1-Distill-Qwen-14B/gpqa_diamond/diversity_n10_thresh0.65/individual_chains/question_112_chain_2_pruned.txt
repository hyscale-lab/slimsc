Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of a certain operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional. I remember that the normalization condition is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component equals 1.

Wait, the components are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me calculate their magnitudes. For (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For (2-i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4+1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the operator is given with matrix elements Aij. The problem says Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So this operator is actually the spin operator in the x-direction, but scaled? Or wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix multiplied by something? Wait, no, the Pauli matrices have entries 1, but here it's hbar/2. So the operator looks like (hbar/2) σ_x.

Wait, I think the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps I should diagonalize the operator A to find its eigenstates. Because the operator's eigenstates are the ones we should project |alpha> onto to find the probabilities.

So let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving det(A - λI) =0.

The matrix A is:

0   hbar/2

hbar/2  0

So the determinant is (0 - λ)^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) = 0.

So λ^2 = hbar^2/4 → λ= ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but then the eigenvectors? Let's find them.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v =0 → [ [-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -
