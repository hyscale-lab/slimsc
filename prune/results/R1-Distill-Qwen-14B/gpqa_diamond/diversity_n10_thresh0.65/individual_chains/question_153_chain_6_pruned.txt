Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate which then leads to the product.

Let's look at each part of the question. There are three reactions given, and I need to figure out their products based on the reactants and the conditions provided.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the acrylate. So, the acrylate has the structure CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but wait, the position might be different. Let me draw this out. The structure is probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, maybe it's more like CH2-CO-OCH3 where the CH2 is attached to the acrylate. Wait, no, wait. The structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the acrylate group with the substituents in the E configuration. So, the carbonyl is at position 1, then a double bond between 2 and 3, and the p-tolyl group is at position 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, perhaps it's CH2-C(COOCH3)=CH-p-tolyl? Or maybe I got that reversed. Wait, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CO-OCH3
