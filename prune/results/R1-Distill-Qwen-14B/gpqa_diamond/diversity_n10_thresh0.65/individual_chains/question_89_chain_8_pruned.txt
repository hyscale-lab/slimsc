Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, forming a light yellow solid product 1. I remember that when adamantane derivatives react with a strong base like KOH, elimination reactions tend to occur, probably via an E2 mechanism. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of an alkene. Because the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, their elimination would form a double bond between those positions. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,3-diene, but I'm not too sure about the exact structure.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a bit downfield, maybe around where alkenes or ethers might appear. Wait, no, 4.79 is more like an alkene proton, but wait, if it's a diene, the protons adjacent to the double bonds would be around there. Alternatively, maybe it's an ABX type coupling? Or perhaps some kind of bridgehead protons. The 2.41-2.23 region is a multiplet for 10H, which sounds like it's the adamantane skeleton, maybe some bridgehead or CH2 groups. The 1.94 ppm (2
