Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think this through.

The problem gives me two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity formulas.

First, the question is about the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two velocities because of the way velocities add in relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same line is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But I need to make sure which one is v1 and v2. Since both are moving in the same direction, let's say astronaut A is the one moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So, from A's frame, what is B's velocity?

Wait, no, wait. No, relative speed is the speed of one object from the frame of the other. So if I'm astronaut A, moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let's compute that.

Wait, but (0.5c - 0.6c) is -0.1c, and the denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. Taking the magnitude, that's about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel=0.14c. So that's a start.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. Each's energy is given by gamma * m c squared, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c
