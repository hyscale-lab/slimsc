Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, because particles that live longer can travel further before decaying. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but how do I get τ from the given data?

The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ would be ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, I should double-check the formula. Oh yeah, Γ is the energy width corresponding to the lifetime, so Γ = ħ / τ. That makes sense because a wider width (shorter lifetime) means the particle decays faster.

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Once I have τ, multiply it by the speed of light c to get the mean decay distance, which is L = cτ.

Wait, but particles are moving when they decay. Oh, right! The lifetime experienced in the lab frame depends on
