Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions because there are only dx and dy terms. So this is a 2D metric, probably embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but I'm not sure if that matters yet.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere, that's like a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, right? The metric given might describe such a surface.

Wait, in 2D, the area element is usually sqrt(g_xy) dx dy, but wait, the metric here is diagonal, so g_xy is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since it's diagonal, the determinant would be g_xx * g_yy. Let's compute that.

The metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and same for g_yy. So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Then the area element dA would be sqrt(determinant) dx dy? Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Wait, det(g) is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², so sqrt(det(g)) is [32/(4 - x² - y²)].

So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Hmm, but wait, the metric is conformally flat because
