Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics and the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this might be similar to the Yukawa interaction, where a boson couples to fermions. The term looks like it's coupling the X boson with some fermion ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. We're asked what are the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

In particle physics, when a boson decays, the possible decay products must satisfy certain conditions. The main thing here is energy conservation and the mass of the particles involved. Each decay product must have a rest mass less than half the mass of X because you can't have each particle having a mass higher than that, else they can't come from a decay (since energy and momentum have to be conserved).

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because when X decays, it produces two particles, each with mass m_f, then 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but I should also remember that for each fermion species, the mass is important. Let's list the known fermion masses to see which are allowed.

Let me think about the masses of the fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV. Negligible compared to 3 GeV. So definitely allowed.
- Down quark (d): about 4-5 MeV. Also allowed.
- Strange (s): around 100 MeV. Still way below 3 GeV.
- Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 3 GeV. So exactly at the limit. Hmm, so can X decay into c c-bar? Because 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is equal to m_X, so yes, it's allowed. But I'll have to make sure about the production. Because in decay, the invariant mass must be at least 2m_f. So if m_X=6 GeV, then 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6. So yes, allowed.
- Bottom (b): m_b is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So b and anti-b cannot be produced. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, but that's irrelevant here because X's mass is only 6 GeV.
- For leptons:
   - Electron (e): mass ~0.5 MeV. So allowed.
   - Muon (μ): about 105 MeV. Allowed.
   - Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_τ is about 3.56 GeV. Which is more than 3 GeV. So 2m_τ is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait: wait, no. 2m_τ is 2 * 1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV. Since X's mass is 6 GeV, then 3.56 is less than 6, so tau pairs are allowed.
Wait, wait, no. Wait, the X is 6 GeV. For a decay into a pair (like τ+ τ-), the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So each τ is about 1.78 GeV, so two of them sum to about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ decays are allowed.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the possible decays at the lowest order. So the decay must be possible via the interaction given in the Lagrangian.

Looking back, the interaction term is L = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, this notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

Wait, the term is written as -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps it's better to write it as -λ (ψ_f)^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. But maybe I should think about the structure. Since
