Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this.

So, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the conditions can be treated as a blackbody at a certain temperature.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a system. The equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So star_1 has twice the population in the higher energy level compared to star_2. Let me clarify: if the population in the excited state for star_1 is n1, and for star_2 it's n2, then n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, wait, maybe the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) for each star. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, let me rephrase. Let’s denote for each star, the ratio of the excited level (n_upper) to the lower level (n_lower) as R. So for star_1, R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower, and for star_2, R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower. The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2. Because the excitation is twice as much in star_1.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Since we're comparing two stars, perhaps the statistical weights (g) are the same for both, so when taking the ratio R1/R2, the g factors would cancel out.

Wait, but in this problem, we are told that the energy difference Δ
