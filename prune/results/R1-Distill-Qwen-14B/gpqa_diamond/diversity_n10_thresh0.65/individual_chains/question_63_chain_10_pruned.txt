Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is made up of elements X and Y. The given data includes their masses, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, wait. The fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model... I remember that the energy levels have two parts: rotational and vibrational. Oh right, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be modeled using the rotational (non-rigid rotor) and vibrational (harmonic oscillator) contributions.

So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state with the lowest possible energy—hmm. Since the molecule is diatomic, its energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. To get the next state, I'm guessing it's the first excited state, but I'm not sure if it's a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The lowest possible would be the next higher state, but which one comes next? Oh, I think that the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. But each vibrational level can have rotational states (like R = 0,1,2,...), so the total energy is a combination of both.

Wait, but the problem is about a photon causing a transition. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule goes from one energy state to another. The energy of the photon must match the energy difference between these states.

So the molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible state would be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or some rotational state (v=0, J=1), but which one would have a lower energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy depends on the square of the angular frequency and the vibrational quantum number, while the rotational energy depends on the moment of inertia and the rotational quantum number. So which has a smaller energy difference?

The problem gives the angular frequency ω as 4
