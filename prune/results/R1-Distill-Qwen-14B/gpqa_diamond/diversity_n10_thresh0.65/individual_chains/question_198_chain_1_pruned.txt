Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I remember that different complexes have different colors. Dithiocyanato might be the Co(SCN)_2^ something ion. Oh right, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n varies based on how many SCN- ions are attached.

Stability constants, β, are the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, and so on.

I think the general approach here is to calculate the distribution of each complex species. Since there are four stability constants, there are four possible complexes: Co(SCN)^0, Co(SCN)₂^+, Co(SCN)₃^2+, and Co(SCN)₄^3+.

Wait, wait, but the question specifically asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Which one is that? I recall that [Co(SCN)₆]^3- is a different color, but the dithiocyanato would be the one with two SCN- ions. So that's [Co(SCN)₂]^2+? Or wait, no, maybe it's [Co(SCN)₂]^+ or something else. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about the charges. Cobalt(II) is Co²+. Each SCN- is -1. So for each complex:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ would be Co²+ + SCN^- → charge is +1. Because 2+ + (-1) = +1, but wait, how many SCN- are attached? Oh, wait, the first complex is Co(SCN), so one SCN. Then charge is 2+ -1 = +1.
