Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think. The question says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The cavity is smaller and not at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so its distance L is larger than R. Also, the point's distance from the cavity's center is l, and l is bigger than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the setup, maybe I should visualize it.

So, the conductor is uncharged, but when you put a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in a conductor, charges redistribute to cancel the internal field. But this is a cavity with a charge. Oh, right, in electrostatics, the charges in the conductor will arrange themselves such that the cavity's charge induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, more specifically: when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor being neutral, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the charge inside the cavity. So, if q is positive, the inner surface will have -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance.

Wait, let me think again. The conductor was initially uncharged. So, the total charge on the conductor is zero. When the charge +q is placed in the cavity, it induces a -q on the inner surface. But since the conductor must remain neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Oh wait, no. Because the inner surface has -q, the conductor's total charge is sum of inner and outer. So, conductor's net charge is zero: inner is -q, outer must be +q so that total is zero. Oh, right, because the conductor itself can't have net charge if it's initially neutral. So the outer surface would have +q.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface would distribute such that the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. Because for a conducting shell, the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge outside. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The conductor's own charge is +q on the outside, so the external field should behave as if that charge is a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface are distributed spherically symmetrically. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

Wait, but wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because for a spherical shell with charge Q, the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

So, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but let me make sure. The point P's distance from the conductor's center is L, and the conductor's outer charge is +q. So the field should be as if it's a point charge at the center. So the answer would be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, what about the position of the cavity's center? The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and there's an angle θ. Hmm, maybe that's a red herring. Because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is spherical symmetric, regardless of where the cavity is.

Wait, no. Oh, wait! Wait a minute. No, the conductor is a spherical shell, but the cavity is not centered. The cavity is shifted by a distance s from the center. But the conductor is a conducting shell, which implies that the charges are free to move. So the inner surface would adjust to the position of +q.

But the question is about the electric field outside the conductor. Because the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, and the charge distribution on the outer surface is spherically symmetric, regardless of the position of the cavity. Because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charges (even if the cavity is off-center) would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge, but the outer surface, being a conductor, would have charge distributed uniformly as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but wait, no. That's only if the conductor is isolated. But in this case, the conductor is a conductor with a cavity. The inner surface has charge -q, so the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's net charge zero (since it was initially uncharged). So the outer surface's charge is +q and distributed uniformly because the conductor is a sphere. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor would be that of a point charge +q at the center. So regardless of where the cavity is or where P is, as long as it's outside, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but wait again. Because the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance from the cavity's center is l. So if the cavity's center is at a displacement s from the conductor's center, the position of the point P relative to the cavity's center is l, with angle θ. But since the outer surface is uniformly charged, the field at P would only depend on the total charge and the distance from the center, not the position relative to the cavity.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. This induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. Since the conductor remains neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conducting shell depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the shell and not on the internal distribution of charges. For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly due to the spherical symmetry. Thus, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Electric Field**: The point $P$ is outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is therefore given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   The distances $l$ and $s$, as well as the angle $\theta$, do not affect the field at $P$ because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived formula for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also irrelevant.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the denominator is $l^2$, the correct distance for the field outside the conductor is $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
