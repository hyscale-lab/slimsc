Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

The speed given is 0.96c. Let me plug that into the gamma equation. So v is 0.96c. Squaring that gives (0.96)^2 c². Let's calculate that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, I think sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately.

Now, the energy of the particle in a collider is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m * c². But wait, I think in particle physics, the energy is often given in units where c=1, so E = gamma * m. But in real terms, it's gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

So first, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Lithium-6 has an atomic mass. The atomic mass units (like in the periodic table) are approximately the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) multiplied by the number of nucleons. Wait
