Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases gas B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which I think is close to 0 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0 C, so 277 is about 4 C. Not sure if that's important yet, but I'll keep it in mind.

Substance X is known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Okay, so maybe it's an element that commonly has isotopes, like chlorine or something. The reaction with Y is violent, so it's probably a strong reaction, maybe an acid-base reaction or something exothermic.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, so the molecule must be something like H2O or CO2? Wait, no. Let's think: each molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total protons equals total neutrons.

Wait, each molecule of W. So if W is H2O, let's see: H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons: 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons in H2O: H has 0 (assuming protium), O has 8 (since O is atomic number 8, so 16-8=8 neutrons). So total neutrons: 2*0 + 8 = 8. Oh wait, that's not equal to protons (10). So that doesn't work.

What about CO2? C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2: protons =6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 (since C's atomic mass is ~12, 12-6=6), O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8=22. Oh, that works! So W is CO2. Wait, but the reaction is violent. Let me think. If X is reacting with a liquid Y, which could be maybe water or something else. Or maybe Y is a strong acid or base.

Wait, another possibility: NH3? Let's see. NH
