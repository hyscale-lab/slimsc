Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, so first, I need to figure out which complex is the blue dithiocyanato one. I remember that different coordination numbers and ligands can lead to different colors. Oh right, Co(II) with different numbers of SCN- ligands forms different complexes. The blue one is probably the hexadentate or something else. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says dithiocyanato, which would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^something. But wait, what's the charge?

Each SCN- is -1, so two would be -2. Co is II, so Co^2+ plus two SCN- would make [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But wait, that can't be right because Co^2+ and two SCN- would give a neutral complex? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe it's a different stoichiometry. Wait, the stability constants are given for complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands, I think. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, stability constants are for the formation of the complex from the metal and the ligands.

Stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each step:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = 9
[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2] → β2 = 40
[Co(SCN)_2] + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3 = 63
[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4 =16

Wait, wait, no, the way β is usually defined is for the formation of each step. So for the nth complex, βn is for the nth ligand added.

So the complexes would be:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → so Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+ ; β1=9
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2] → Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2] ; β2=40. Wait, no, the β2 for the second step is 40, so the overall β for the second complex would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360? Or wait, no, each β is for the step from the (n-1)th complex to the nth.

So the overall β for each complex is the product of the βs up to that step.

So for [Co(SCN)], β = β1 =9.

For [Co(SCN)_2], β = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3], β = β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63=25200.

For [Co(SCN)_4], β = β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16=302400.

Wait, maybe I need to correct that. Wait, the formation for each complex is cumulative. So [Co(SCN)_2] is formed by adding another SCN^- to [CoSCN]^+.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2, which is 9*40=360. Similarly, each step adds the next β.

So the four complexes have the following overall β:

n=1: β=9

n=2: 9*40=360

n=3: 9*40*63=25200

n=4: 9*40*63*16=302400.

So the complexes are:

[Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), β=9

[Co(SCN)_2] (n=2), β=360

[Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), β=25200

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4), β=302400.

Wait, but in solution, the concentration of each complex depends on the β and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], as dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands attached. So we're looking for [Co(SCN)_2], which is the n=2 complex.

To find the percentage of this species, I need to calculate the mole fractions of each possible cobalt species (free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-), and then find what fraction is [Co(SCN)_2].

The approach here is to use the distribution of the species based on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

The equation for the fraction of each species is based on the formation of the complexes. The fraction of each complex is given by (β_n [Co]^n [SCN]^n) / (sum over all species of their terms).

Wait, but another approach is to consider that the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species.

Total cobalt concentration c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

The total is given as 1e-2 M.

The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is relatively high, so more ligand is present, which would tend to form higher complexes.

But to compute the fractions, we can model it as:

The fraction of each species is proportional to (β_n) * [SCN-]^n.

Because the denominator for each term in the fraction would include [Co^2+] which is variable, but perhaps we can model it using the concentration of Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the distribution using the following expression.

The fraction f_n of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN]^k )

Because [Co^2+] is the free ion, and the denominator becomes the sum over all possible species, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, wait, let me think: the formation of the first complex is [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

The total [Co] is the sum of [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + etc.

But since [Co^2+] is present in all terms, perhaps we can express each species in terms of [Co^2+].

Let me think, perhaps I can let [Co^2+] = x.

Then [CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN^-]

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2

And [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4

So each species can be expressed as:

Species: Co^2+ → x

[CoSCN]^+ → β1 x [SCN]

[Co(SCN)_2] → β1 β2 x [SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4

Now, the total cobalt concentration is x + β1 x [SCN] + β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = c_total.

We can factor out x:

x [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c_total.

So,

x = c_total / [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ]

Once we find x, the fractions of each species can be found as:

f_n = [β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n x ] / c_total

Because c_total is the sum of all these terms including x.

Wait, alternatively, since c_total = x + sum_{n=1}^4 (β1 ... βn [SCN]^n x )

Which is x (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 (β1 ... βn [SCN]^n) ) = c_total.

So, the fractions f_n for each species (including Co^2+) are:

f_0 = x / c_total = [c_total / (1 + sum)] * [1 / c_total] ] ? Wait, no.

Wait, the fractions are:

f_0 = [Co^2+] / c_total = x / c_total

f_1 = [CoSCN]^+ / c_total = (β1 x [SCN]) / c_total

f_2 = (β1 β2 x [SCN]^2) / c_total

And so on.

But since c_total = x (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 (β1...βn [SCN]^n) ), then:

f_n = β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n x / c_total

= β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n (x) / (x (1 + sum ... )) )

The x cancels out, so:

f_n = β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n / (1 + sum_{k=0}^4 (β1..βk [SCN]^k) )

Wait, wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Actually, the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

Because for each species, including the free Co^2+ (n=0), the term is 1 (since f_0 = 1/(1 + ... )).

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to model the fractions as:

f_0 = 1 / D

f_1 = (β1 [SCN]) / D

f_2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / D

f_3 = (β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3) / D

f_4 = (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4) / D

Where D is the sum of all terms:

D = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

So D is the denominator.

Because the fractions are calculated as the product of the stability constants up to that complex, multiplied by the appropriate power of [SCN], divided by the sum of all such terms plus 1.

So the steps to calculate are:

1. Compute each term for n=0 to 4.

n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

n=3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = 25200 * 0.001 =25.2

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 = 302400 * (0.1)^4 = 302400 * 0.0001 = 30.24

Wait wait, let me compute each step carefully.

Compute each term:

n=0: term0 = 1.

n=1: term1 = β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: term2 = β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6.

n=3: term3 = β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN]^3 =9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. [SCN]^3 = 1e-3.

So 22680 * 1e-3 =22.68.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought 9*40*63=25200, which is correct. Then multiplied by (0.1)^3=0.001, which gives 25.2.

Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63 = 22680? Wait, 360 *60=21600, 360*3=1080 → 22680. So 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Wait, earlier I thought it's 25.2. Hmm, but wait 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

So term3=22.68.

n=4: term4=β1β2β3β4 * [SCN]^4.

β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16 → let's compute that:

9 *40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

[SCN]^4= (0.1)^4=0.0001.

So term4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Wait, perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate:

Beta4 is 16.

So term4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Multiply 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

term0=1,

term1=0.9,

term2=3.6,

term3=22.68,

term4=36.288.

Now sum all these terms:

sum = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let's compute step by step.

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction f2 is term2 / D =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05555 or 5.555%.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2] (n=2), so f2 is the fraction.

Wait, but wait, 3.6 /64.468 is approximately 0.05555, which is about 5.555%. That's option D) 16.9%? No, wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 5.5% isn't one of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Because I remember that in some cases, higher coordination complexes have different colors. Alternatively, maybe I got the wrong complex.

Wait, the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%. 3.6 is 5.5%, which isn't among them. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the terms.

Wait, let me recalculate the terms.

Compute each term again.

term0: 1.

term1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2.

9 *40=360, 0.1^2=0.01 →360 *0.01=3.6.

term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

9*40=360, 360*63=22680. (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68.

term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 64.468.

So term2 is 3.6, so fraction is 3.6/64.468 ≈ 0.05555, which is 5.555% → about 5.56%.

But the options don't have that. So something's wrong. Did I get the wrong complex?

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Let's check what the fraction would be for term4.

f4=36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5629, which is 56.29%. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the β values. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for the stepwise formation constants.

So the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ is β1=9.

The formation of [Co(SCN)_2] from [Co(SCN)]^+ is β2=40.

The formation of [Co(SCN)_3]^- from [Co(SCN)_2] is β3=63.

The formation of [Co(SCN)_4]^2- from [Co(SCN)_3]^- is β4=16.

Wait, but then the overall β for each complex is the product of all previous β's.

So for [Co(SCN)]^+, β=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2], β=9 *40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^- β=9 *40 *63=25200.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, β=9 *40 *63 *16=302400.

Wait, but earlier I computed term4 as 362880 * 0.0001=36.288, which is correct.

But maybe I need to check if the species are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) ?

Wait, each SCN- is -1. Co^2+ plus n SCN- gives charge 2 -n.

Wait, but in terms of the overall charge, perhaps the complexes are:

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is (2+) + (-1) = +1.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 2*(-1) + 2+ =0.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- →3*(-1)+2+ =-1.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2− →4*(-1)+2+ =-2.

So in terms of the fractions, for [Co(SCN)_2], that's n=2.

So term2 is 3.6, which is 3.6/64.468 ≈5.56%.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake in the way I calculated the terms.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each β is for the step, but the overall formation constant is the product up to that step.

So D is correct, but perhaps there's a mistake in the way I calculated the fractions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the concentration of Co^2+ is 1e-2 M, and the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. So I think I did the calculation correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- or [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is about the fraction of all Co in [Co(SCN)_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex. So let's recalculate the fractions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the computation of the terms.

Wait, term3 is 9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 * 0.001=22.68. That's correct.

Term4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So D=1 +0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288=64.468.

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05555 or 5.56%.

Hmm, no such option.

Wait, maybe the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], which is the n=2 complex. So the fraction should be about 5.56%, but that's not an option.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should have used the stepwise βs differently.

Alternatively, maybe the sum includes all terms, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions correctly.

Let me try another approach. Let me compute each term again, and the sum.

term0=1.

term1=9 *0.1=0.9.

term2=9*40 *(0.1)^2=9*40 *0.01=3.6.

term3=9*40 *63 * (0.1)^3=9*40=360, 360*63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68.

term4=9*40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4=9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880, 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum is 1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, yes, the sum is correct.

So f2=3.6/64.468 ≈0.05555 →5.55%.

But the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.

None of these match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the β values. Let me think: perhaps the given βs are for the overall complexes, not the stepwise. So β1 is the overall for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

Wait, but the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63 and beta4=16."

Wait, stability constant K is the equilibrium constant for the entire formation.

So, for [Co(SCN)]^+, K1=β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2], K2=β2=40.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because each β is the stepwise formation constant. Alternatively, perhaps the given βs are the overall βs for each complex.

Wait, if that's the case, then for each complex:

[Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9.

[Co(SCN)_2] → β2=40.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4=16.

Wait, but that would mean that the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2] is 40, which is lower than that of [Co(SCN)_3], which is 63.

Wait, but that would mean that the [Co(SCN)_3] is more stable than [Co(SCN)_2], which may not make sense because higher β indicates greater stability.

Wait, but perhaps the problem provides the overall β for each complex.

So, for [Co(SCN)_2], the overall β is 40.

Then, the terms would be:

term0=1,

term1=9,

term2=40,

term3=63,

term4=16.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the sum would be 1+9+40+63+16=129.

So the fraction for n=2 would be 40/129≈30.9%, which is still not matching any option.

Wait, but the given βs are for the stepwise formation. So earlier approach was correct.

So perhaps the problem is that the blue complex is not [Co(SCN)_2], but another one.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is the tetrathiocyanatocuprate(II), and that has a higher fraction.

Wait, term4 is 36.288, and D=64.468. So f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5629, which is 56.29%. But that's not an option either.

Wait the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the terms. Maybe I should compute each term again.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step, carefully.

Compute term0: 1.

term1: β1*[SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

term2: β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

term3: β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN]^3=9 *40*63*(0.1)^3=9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*(0.001)=22.68.

term4: β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute step by step:

9 *40 = 360.

360 *63 = 22680.

22680 *16 = 362880.

[SCN]^4 = (0.1)^4 = 0.0001.

362880 *0.0001 =36.288.

So terms are 1, 0.9,3.6,22.68,36.288.

Summing: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.555%.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem refers to the dithiocyanato as a different complex. Maybe I got the wrong n.

Wait, perhaps dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^-.

Wait, but no, n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^-, which is n=3.

So f3=22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3519 →35.19%.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the distribution of Co in each species, including the free ion. So perhaps the problem is that I forgot to include all the terms.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers the total concentration of Co as including all species, and I might have to compute the fraction of each species based on the total.

Wait, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stability constants.

Wait, the question says the stability constants are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16.

Wait, wait, for the complex [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, the overall β is 9*40*63*16=302400.

But when I computed term4, I used [SCN]^4=0.1^4=0.0001, so term4=302400 * 0.0001=30.24? Or wait, no, because beta4 is stepwise.

Wait, wait, earlier calculation for term4 was 362880 *0.0001=36.288, but that would be if beta4=16 was included as a step in the product. But perhaps I have a miscalculation in the product.

Let me recalculate the product for term4.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So term4=β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * [SCN]^4.

Which is 9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

So term4=362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So the fractions are as before.

But none match the options provided. So perhaps I am misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is about the percentage of complexes that have exactly two SCN- ligands, which is [Co(SCN)_2], but perhaps including both possible charges or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the 'blue' complex as [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which is more likely to be a higher complex, perhaps more stable, and more abundant.

In that case, the fraction would be term4/D=36.288/64.468≈0.5629 →56.29%. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the mole fractions using the concentrations correctly.

Let me see, the formula for the mole fraction is:

xn = βn [Co]^n [SCN]^n / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [Co]^k [SCN]^k )

Wait, but wait, perhaps [Co] is c_total, which is 1e-2 M.

Wait, no, because each term is [Co]^k, which is [Co^2+]^k multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me think again.

Each species [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) has a concentration given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

So, total cobalt is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN] + β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4.

Factor out [Co^2+], which gives:

c_total = [Co^2+] [1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ].

So, [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ).

Which is the same as before.

Thus, [Co^2+] = 1e-2 / D, where D=64.468.

So [Co^2+] = 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Then, the fractions are:

f0 = [Co^2+] / c_total = (1e-2/64.468) / 1e-2 = 1/64.468 ≈0.01551 → 1.551%.

f1 = (β1 [Co^2+] [SCN]) / c_total.

= (9 * 1.551e-4 * 0.1 ) / 1e-2.

= (9 *1.551e-5 ) / 1e-2 → (1.3959e-4) /1e-2 = 0.013959 →1.396%.

f2 = (β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2 ) / c_total.

= (9*40 * 1.551e-4 * 0.01 ) / 1e-2.

= (360 * 1.551e-6 ) / 1e-2 → 5.5836e-4 / 1e-2 =0.055836 →5.5836%.

f3 = (9*40*63 *1.551e-4 * 0.001) /1e-2.

= (22680 *1.551e-7) /1e-2 → 3.516e-3 /1e-2 →0.3516 →35.16%.

f4 = (9*40*63*16 *1.551e-4 *0.0001 ) /1e-2.

= (362880 *1.551e-8 ) /1e-2 →5.616e-3 /1e-2 →0.5616 →56.16%.

Wait, that can't be right because f0 +f1 +f2 +f3 +f4 should add up to 1.

Wait, 1.55% +1.396% +5.58% +35.16% +56.16% = 100%, which sums correctly.

But according to this, the percentage for [Co(SCN)_2] is about 5.58%, which is still not matching any options.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the stepwise βs, but perhaps the given βs are overall βs for each complex.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

So if, for example, [Co(SCN)_2] has a β=40 (overall), [Co(SCN)_3] has β=63, [Co(SCN)_4] has β=16.

Then the terms would be:

term0=1,

term1=40*(0.1)=4,

term2=63*(0.1)^2=63*0.01=0.63,

term3=16*(0.1)^3=16*0.001=0.016.

Wait, but that can't be right because the βs should increase with higher stability. So [Co(SCN)_3] would have a higher β than [Co(SCN)_2], which may not be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the β notation. Maybe the given βs are for each successive complex, meaning that β1 is the stability constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

In that case, the overall β for the nth complex is βn.

So for [CoSCN]^+, β=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2], β=40.

For [Co(SCN)_3], β=63.

For [Co(SCN)_4], β=16.

But that would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible, but the numbers seem a bit odd.

In that case, the terms would be:

term0=1.

term1=9*0.1=0.9.

term2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

term3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

term4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

Then, the fractions would be:

f0=1/2.3646≈0.4226 →42.26%.

f1=0.9/2.3646≈0.3809 →38.09%.

f2=0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

f3=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

f4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%.

So, the percentages are 42.3% (f0), 38.1% (f1), 16.9% (f2), etc.

Wait, but in this scenario, the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is f2=16.9%, which is option D.

But the question asks for the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], so the percentage would be 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, according to this approach, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when considering stepwise βs, the fraction was 5.56%, which is not an option.

So perhaps the given βs are the overall βs for each complex, not the stepwise. So the correct approach is to use the overall βs as given.

But why would β4=16 be lower than β3=63? That suggests that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible, but perhaps it's a mistake in the problem setup.

But given the options, the only matching one is option D)16.9%.

So, the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16), the total cobalt concentration ([Co] = 10⁻² M), and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constant (β) for each complex is defined as the equilibrium constant for its formation. The overall β for each complex is given directly as β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄ for [CoSCN]⁺, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]⁻, and [Co(SCN)_4]²⁻, respectively.

2. **Fraction of Each Species**:
   - The fraction of each cobalt species is proportional to the product of its stability constant and the appropriate power of [SCN⁻], normalized by the sum of all such terms:
     \[
     f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
     \]
   - Here, \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), and the terms for \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 4 \) represent the free cobalt ion ([Co²⁺]) and the four complexes, respectively.

3. **Calculation of Terms**:
   - Compute each term:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     \text{Term}_0 &= 1, \\
     \text{Term}_1 &= \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
     \text{Term}_2 &= \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
     \text{Term}_3 &= \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
     \text{Term}_4 &= \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - Sum these terms:
     \[
     D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
     \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]**:
   - The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
