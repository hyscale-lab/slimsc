Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're provided with the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? And the components are given as matrices. So, each component P_x, P_y, P_z are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are represented as vectors of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, probably P is a spin operator here, but the question is about an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component must be zero. So, n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps, but I'm not exactly sure. Or maybe (x, z) components with y=0.

But the eigenvector of the operator P in the direction n would be along that direction. So the operator P along n is given by the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So, P ⋅ n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P ⋅ n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

And the eigenvalue equation is (P ⋅ n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue would be the component in that direction, so (P ⋅ n)|v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So I need to construct the matrix for P ⋅ n, then find its eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But let's first write down the individual matrices.

Given:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So let me write these matrices
