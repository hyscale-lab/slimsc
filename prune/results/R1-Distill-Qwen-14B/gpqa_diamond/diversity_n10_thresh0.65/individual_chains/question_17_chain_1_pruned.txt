Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where we have a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about the pH affecting the EDTA's protonation state or anything like that.

Wait, so what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (K) for a complex ion like Ca-EDTA is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The formula is usually K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

But wait, in this case, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. So the complex is already formed. However, some of it might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. The question is asking for the concentration of Ca²+ in solution.

So if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, let's denote the concentration of the complex as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Similarly, the concentration of free EDTA would be x, assuming that each dissociation releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA.

But wait, no. Wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for Ca²+ and EDTA in the complex. So when the complex dissociates, each mole of complex produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA. So if the complex is 0.02 M, and if it dissociates a little, the concentrations would be:

[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA] = x

But wait, wait a minute. Wait, the problem says that the concentration
