Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them to the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, so dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it can form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile. The other reactant is an acrylate ester, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, no, the structure is more like CH2-C(O)OCH3 on one side and a p-tolyl group on the other. Oh wait, maybe the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 where the adjacent CH2 is connected to the p-tolyl group. So, the structure would be CH2-C(=O)-OCH2CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally. The formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester. So, the double bond is between C2 and C3, perhaps. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a substituent on the alpha position. Hmm, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C2. So the acrylate is like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, with the E configuration.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2C(COOH)2, but since it's the methyl ester, it's (CH3)2C(COOCH3)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms the enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta (the CH2) part of the acrylate. The reaction would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha carbon of the enolate and the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, let me think again. The enolate is a strong nucleophile. The acrylate has the double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. The enolate attacks the beta carbon, leading to a conjugate addition (Michael addition). So the enolate's alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So, the product
