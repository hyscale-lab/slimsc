Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformal metric because it's a scalar function times the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²). Conformal metrics are nice because they preserve angles, and areas can be calculated using the determinant of the metric tensor.

So, the area element in a 2D metric is usually given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. But wait, for a conformal metric, the determinant is just (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²). Since it's diagonal and the off-diagonal terms are zero, the determinant is (g_xx)*(g_yy) = (g(x,y))². Oh wait, because in this case, g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

But the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt([32/(4 - x² - y²)]²) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but what's the region over which we're integrating? The metric has a denominator of (4 - x² - y²). So the denominator must not be zero, which implies that x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 centered at the origin in the x-y plane.

Wait, but this is a pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature. Oh, right! The metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix) has a specific form. The given metric looks similar to the metric of a pseudosphere.

Wait, another thought: the metric provided is in 2D, so perhaps it's representing the surface of a pseudosphere in some coordinates. Alternatively, maybe it's a metric on a 2D surface with constant negative curvature.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. Let me think about the properties of a pseudosphere. I remember that a pseudosphere has infinite surface area. Because it's like a tractrix being rotated, and the surface area is infinite. Because as you go towards the "equ
