Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I think I need to determine what reagents A and B are from the options given.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Reacting ketones with NaCN usually leads to a substitution reaction. Wait, I remember that in the presence of a strong acid, maybe like H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A), the ketone can undergo a nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would act as a nucleophile here.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes when a ketone is treated with a nitrile and an acid, it's an example of the Stephen reduction, but wait, no, Stephen involves ketones and amines. Or maybe it's a condensation reaction?

Wait, but butan-2-one adding CN-... Oh, right! Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. In a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is electrophilic. So the CN- would attack the carbonyl, and then the oxygen would pick up a proton. But wait, butan-2-one has a structure where there are two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl. So when cyanide adds, it would form a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense because the CN adds to the carbonyl, the oxygen becomes OH, and the structure would have both groups on the same carbon.

So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. For that, the conditions are typically acid-catalyzed. So the reagent A would be something like a strong acid, like H3O+ (option A and B), or perhaps something else.

Wait, but the other options for A are NaHSO3. Hmm. What's that used for? Oh, sometimes NaHSO3 is used in the hydroboration reaction or maybe in some oxidation steps. Or perhaps, wait, maybe if it's a
