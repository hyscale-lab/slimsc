Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me walk through my thought process step by step.

Alright, the compound's molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 8, H is 9, X is 0, N is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Five could be one ring (which counts as 1) and four double bonds, but that's unlikely. Maybe a benzene ring (which counts as 3, since a benzene has three double bonds) and then some other structures. Let's see.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift; maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet suggests two neighboring protons. But aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and donâ€™t have neighboring Hs because aldehydes are RCHO. Oh, wait, unless it's conjugated in some way. Hmm.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That sounds like aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet could mean each is next to one substituent. Wait, in a para-substituted aromatic, the protons are typically a doublet of doublets? Or if it's a para-substituted and another substituent is on the ring, maybe...

Wait, let me think. Another peak: 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic perhaps. So maybe two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene and another substituent, maybe another benzene ring? Or perhaps a di-substituted benzene where there are two sets of doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton or something else.

Wait, the next peak is 6.27, broad singlet, 2H
