Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the question.

So, the scenario is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Astronomers are observing this star, and because of the spots, when the star rotates, the brightness variations caused by the spots modulating as the star spins can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is asking: what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have, relative to the star, to produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spots do?

The options are A to D, with some decimals. I need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm. So first, I think I should figure out what the brightness variation caused by the spots is. Then, compare that to the variation you'd get from a planet transiting the star, and set their amplitudes equal to solve for Rpl.

Wait, but the problem says the photometric observations would show variations due to rotation. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes. But for a planet, the variation is when the planet passes in front of the star, blocking some light. So the amplitude of the dip in brightness depends on the size of the blocking object relative to the star.

But wait, the spots are dark. So when a spot is facing us, the star looks a bit dimmer. So the brightness variation is a dip when spots are visible, and a rise when the spots are not. But since the spots are cooler, their contribution to the star's total luminosity is less. So the star's total brightness would dip when spots are on the hemisphere facing us. But the way the problem is set up, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is what's being compared to the planet's transit.

Wait, no. The question says that the situation (spots) can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So the brightness variations caused by the spots are similar to those from a planet. But the question is, if instead of spots, the
