Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ_f f̄(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, I think I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Let me parse this. The Lagrangian term looks like it's describing an interaction between the boson X and some fermions. The term seems to involve a coupling constant λ_f, a fermion field ψ_f, and the boson X. Oh wait, maybe the term is written as something like -λ_f (ψ_f)^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f? Because that's a common form for Yukawa interactions. Or perhaps it's written as ψ_f bar times (v + X) times ψ_f.

So the structure looks like a Yukawa coupling term, where the scalar boson X is interacting with a fermion ψ_f. The decay of X would then depend on the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can produce.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to consider which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV, because the boson can't decay into particles whose combined mass is higher.

So first, I should list out all possible fermions that could be produced. Let's think about the known fermions and their masses. The fermions include quarks, leptons, and maybe others. Wait, but in this case, the problem is likely considering Standard Model particles.

Let me list the masses of the fermions. I'll have to approximate, but here's what I remember:

Quarks:
- Up and down: around 2-5 MeV each. So combined, about 4-10 MeV. But wait, that's super low, so X can decay into them easily because 6 GeV is way bigger.
- Strange: around 100 MeV (each), so 200 MeV combined.
- Charm: about 1.5 GeV each, so 3 GeV total. So X has 6 GeV, so 3 GeV is less than 6, so decay into c cbar is allowed.
- Bottom: around 4.5 GeV each. So 9 GeV total. Wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 2 * 4.5 is 9, which is greater than 6. So b bbar is not allowed.
- Top is way heavier, like 173 GeV, so definitely can't decay into t tbar.

Leptons:
- Electron: about 0.5 MeV each. So combined, 1 MeV. Definitely allowed.
- Muon: about 105 MeV each, so 210 MeV total. Also allowed.
- Tau: about 1.78 GeV each, so 3.56 GeV total. That's under 6 GeV, so decay into tau+ tau- is allowed.

Other fermions? Maybe neutrinos, but they are very light, so their mass is negligible. But since X is a boson, it can't decay into neutrinos because they are neutral and the boson is neutral as well. Wait, but in the Lagrangian, if the boson X is interacting with neutrinos, then it could decay into them. But typically, in the Standard Model, neutrinos don't have masses that are large, and they don't have Yukawa couplings (except maybe for the Higgs interaction). But in this question, the interaction is given as involving X, so perhaps the fermions include neutrinos. Hmm.

Wait, the problem statement's Lagrangian is given as involving f, which I think might be a fermion. Wait, perhaps the term is more like -λ times the sum over all fermions f of [f̄ (v + X) ψ_f ] ? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me clarify.

Looking again: the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f̄(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't quite parse correctly. Maybe it's a typo? Alternatively, perhaps it's L(y) = -λ [sum over f] (f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y) ), where f is a fermion. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as L = -λ (ψ_f)^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. So the interaction term is something like ψ_f^dagger X ψ_f, which would imply that the boson X is coupling to the fermions ψ_f.

In that case, for each fermion species, the X can decay into that fermion and its antiparticle. So the possible decay modes are X → f f̄, provided that the mass of X is at least twice the mass of the fermion f.

So let's list all possible fermions and their masses:

1. Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
2. Down quark (d): ~5 MeV
3. Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
4. Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
5. Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
6. Top quark (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV, so X can't decay into t tbar.
7. Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
8. Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
9. Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
10. Neutrinos (ν_e, ν_mu, ν_tau): their masses are negligible (but maybe in some models, they have tiny masses, but for this problem, perhaps we can ignore them because 6 GeV is way bigger than even the largest possible neutrino mass, which is maybe a few eV).

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's calculate the 2m_f for each:

- For electrons: 2 * 0.5 MeV = 1 MeV → allowed
- Muons: 2 * 105 MeV = 210 MeV → allowed
- Tau: 2 * 1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV → allowed
- Up quarks: 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV → allowed
- Down quarks: 2 *5 MeV=10 MeV → allowed
- Strange quarks: 2 * 100 MeV = 200 MeV → allowed
- Charm quarks: 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV → allowed
- Bottom quarks: 2 *4.5 = 9 GeV → not allowed, since X is 6 GeV.

Top quarks: as said, way too heavy.

So possible decays are into:

e+ e-
μ+ μ-
τ+ τ-
u ū
d d̄
s s̄
c c̄

Wait, but wait: the problem is about the interaction. The Lagrangian includes all these fermions, right? Because the problem states that the interaction is given by that term. So for each fermion f, there's a coupling. So all the fermions are allowed, provided their mass is less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV is X's mass, so each fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV).

Wait, so for the charm quark, each is about 1.5 GeV, so total 3 GeV. So that's allowed.

But for bottom quark, each is 4.5 GeV, so 9 GeV total, which is more than X's mass. So bottom quarks are out.

So the possible decay channels are into e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, and c c̄.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b is 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A is incorrect because it includes b bbar.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So c's mass is 1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV total. So that's allowed. s is 100 MeV, so 200 MeV total, allowed. u and d are even lighter. Tau: 1.78 GeV, so 3.56 GeV, allowed. Mu: 105 MeV, so 210 MeV, allowed. e is even lighter. So option B lists all these except b and t.

Wait, but option B includes c cbar. So is that correct? Because 2*m_c = 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV.

So yes, that's allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option C: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But t is way too heavy (173 GeV), so X can't decay into t tbar. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b bbar which isn't allowed, so D is incorrect.

So option B is the correct one because it includes all the allowed fermion pairs except those that are too heavy. Let me check the option letters.

Looking back:

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

So that's all the allowed decay modes.

But wait, let me double-check. The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. Does the Lagrangian include all these fermions? Because the problem says "fermions" in general, so yes, any fermion with a mass less than 3 GeV can be produced.

But wait, wait a second. I think I might have a mistake here. Because in the Lagrangian given, is it written as f̄ (v + X) ψ_f, which implies that the interaction is for each fermion species. So each fermion f would have its own coupling. So for each fermion, X can decay into that f and f-bar.

So all fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV would be allowed. So let's list them:

- u: m=2 MeV → allowed
- d: m=5 MeV → allowed
- s: m=100 MeV → allowed
- c: m=1.5 GeV → allowed
- e: m=0.5 MeV → allowed
- μ: m=105 MeV → allowed
- τ: m=1.78 GeV → allowed

But not b (4.5 GeV) or t (173 GeV).

So the possible decay channels are:

X → u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Looking at the options, option B includes all these, except it doesn't have t t̄, which is not allowed.

Wait, but the options have to match exactly. Looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is wrong.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option C has t, which is wrong.

Option D includes b, which is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option B.

Wait, but another thought: the mass of the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2 m_tau is ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so allowed. So tau is included, yes.

So the available decay modes are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, and c.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

This Lagrangian describes a Yukawa-like interaction between the boson \( X \) and fermions \( \psi_f \). The decay of \( X \) into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f\bar{f} \) is kinematically allowed if the total mass of the pair, \( 2m_f \), is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of Standard Model fermions are approximately:
- \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\mu \approx 105 \, \text{MeV}, \, m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \).

For each fermion \( f \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) determines whether \( X \) can decay into \( f\bar{f} \):
- \( e^+e^- \): \( 2m_e = 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed),
- \( \mu^+\mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu = 210 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed),
- \( \tau^+\tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed),
- \( u\bar{u} \): \( 2m_u = 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed),
- \( d\bar{d} \): \( 2m_d = 10 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed),
- \( s\bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed),
- \( c\bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed),
- \( b\bar{b} \): \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (forbidden, as \( 9 > 6 \)),
- \( t\bar{t} \): \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (forbidden, as \( 346 > 6 \)).

Thus, the allowed decay channels are \( X \to e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
