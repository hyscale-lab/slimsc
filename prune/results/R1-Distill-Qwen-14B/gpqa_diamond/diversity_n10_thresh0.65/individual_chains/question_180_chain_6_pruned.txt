Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, the question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles each having a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that, so 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That would make each charge 3.2e-19 C.

Now, out of these 13 particles, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so point P has a charge, and the other 12 are all around it at a distance of 2 meters. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electrostatic potential energy. Since the system is isolated, we can consider the potential energy stored due to the arrangement of these charges.

Wait, but how do we calculate the potential energy for a system of multiple charges? I remember that the formula for the electrostatic potential energy (U) between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. And for a system with multiple charges, you have to consider all possible pairs and sum up their individual potentials.

Right, so for n charges, the total potential energy is (1/2) * n * (each pair's energy). Because each pair is counted twice, so we take half to avoid double-counting. Wait, no, actually, I think it's more like (
