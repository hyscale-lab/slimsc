Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, so the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that probably means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. Right, the formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So in this case, the excited state and the ground state are the two levels. Let's say the excited state is i and the ground is j.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Or wait, let me clarify. Oh, wait, when they say "twice as excited", does that mean the number of atoms in that specific energy level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2? Or is it the excitation temperature or something else? I think it's the population ratio.

So, for star_1, n1_i / n1_j = 2, and for star_2, n2_i / n2_j = 1. Wait, no, because if in star_1 the excitation is higher, then the population in the excited state should be higher. So if the excitation is twice as much, perhaps n1_i / n1_j = 2, and n2_i /n2_j = 1?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think again. The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio is higher for star_1. So for star_1, the ratio is higher, for star_2, it's lower.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive (the excited state is higher in energy). So the ratio n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So if T is higher, the exponent is more negative, so the ratio is smaller? Wait wait, no: let's see, if T is higher, then k T is larger. So (ΔE)/(k T) is smaller, so the exponent is less negative, meaning the ratio is larger. So a higher T would mean higher population in the excited state.

So for star_1, if the population is higher, that would mean that star_1 has a higher temperature than star_2. Because the ratio is higher, which requires a higher T.

Wait, but the question says that the ratio for star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. Let me set variables.

Let me let ΔE be the energy difference between the two levels, which is given as 1.38e-23 J.

For star_1, the ratio is n1_i / n1_j = 2.

For star_2, the ratio is n2_i /n2_j = 1.

Wait, no, wait. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. Which probably means that the ratio is 2 compared to star_2's ratio. So perhaps n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j) ?

Wait, but the question states that the excitation in star_1 is twice as excited in that energy level as star_2. So maybe n1_i / n1_j is twice (n2_i / n2_j). Hmm, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps in star_1, the population in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2, but that would require knowing the total number, which isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation parameter is the ratio itself. So maybe star_1 has a higher ratio of n_i/n_j than star_2.

So for star_1, n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if for star_2, the ratio is r, then for star_1 it's 2r.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the problem again.

The question is about finding the relation between T1 and T2. So given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, what's the equation for T1 and T2? The options are all in terms of ln(2) and some function of T1 and T2.

So let me write the Boltzmann equation for both stars.

For star 1: (n1_i)/(n1_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n2_i)/(n2_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So I think this means that (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j)

Wait, but perhaps the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio is higher. So (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j) ?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the excitation temperature. But I think for this question, it's more straightforward.

So, putting the two equations together:

(n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i /n2_j )

But according to Boltzmann:

n1_i / n1_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

n2_i / n2_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So substituting:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2 ))

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let's take natural logs on both sides.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2 )

Hmm, let's rearrange terms:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = - ln(2 )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ] = - ln(2 )

Let me see, 1/T1 -1/T2 = [T2 - T1]/(T1 T2 )

So:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2):

ΔE/(k) (T2 - T1) = - ln(2) * T1 T2

Let me rearrange the equation:

(T2 - T1) = [ (- ln(2) ) * T1 T2 * k ] / ΔE

Wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Let me think about ΔE. The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is interesting because k, the Boltzmann constant, is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something. Let me compute ΔE/k.

ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

Wait, that's convenient! So ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So going back, our equation:

ΔE/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] = - ln(2 )

But wait, when I substituted the expressions, I had:

ΔE/(k) [1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ] = - ln(2 )

Which becomes:

1 * [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2 )

So,

(T2 - T1)/(T1 T2 ) = - ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2):

T2 - T1 = - ln(2) * T1 T2

Wait, but that's the same as:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) * T1 T2

Divide both sides by (T1 T2):

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So option D would be the correct equation.

Let me double-check the steps. So we started with the population ratios, used the Boltzmann factor, took the natural log, rearranged, plugged in ΔE = k * 1 K, then ended up with the equation in option D.


To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the populations of energy levels in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for both stars:

\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Substituting these into the population ratio equation:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = -\ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k\) is also \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Rewriting in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Multiplying through by \(-1\):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
