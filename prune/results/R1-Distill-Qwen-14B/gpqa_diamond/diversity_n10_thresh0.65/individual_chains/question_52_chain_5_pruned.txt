Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star's properties when it has spots versus when it doesn't. So, the star has a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay, so I remember from my studies that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature.

The formula is something like (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), each region emits according to its own temperature. So when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, and the rest is the original temperature. But the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So I'm a bit confused here. Does that mean the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, or that the average Teff is 5500 K?

Wait, the problem states that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I think that refers to the average; the star's total emitted flux is lower because 40% is cooler. But when considering the ratio of Ti levels, we're looking at the photosphere in different regions. So perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature.

Wait, but the question says the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Hmm, maybe the photosphere's overall is 5500 K, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the photosphere is in two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

Wait, maybe I need to model the average flux. But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So perhaps each region contributes, but the actual ratio depends on the temperature of the region. Oh, but this might complicate things.

Wait, the problem says to assume the photosphere is in LTE, so each point in the photosphere is in local thermal equilibrium. So when the star has spots, the photosphere has regions with different temperatures. But to compute the ratio of Ti atoms, are we looking at the integrated value across the entire surface, or is the ratio observed a blend from different regions?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies it by considering that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. But that might not make sense because spots are cooler than the surrounding. Wait, no: the effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted flux. So if the whole star's photosphere isn't at the same temperature, the overall Teff is a weighted average based on the areas.

Wait, let me think. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that flux F = σT^4. So when part of the surface is cooler, the total flux would be the sum of the flux from each region. So for the star without spots, the entire surface is at 6000 K. So the total flux is F1 = σ*(6000)^4.

When 40% is covered by spots, let’s say the spot temperature is Ts. The rest (60%) is at 6000 K. The total flux F2
