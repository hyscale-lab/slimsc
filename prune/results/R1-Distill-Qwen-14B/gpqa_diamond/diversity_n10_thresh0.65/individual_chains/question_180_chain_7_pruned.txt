Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me try to break it down. The question is about an isolated system of charges and finding the minimum energy of the system. Hmm.

Alright, so the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. So 2e would be 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. That's 3.2e-19 C each, I think.

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So the 13th charge is stationary, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is related to how they are arranged. Since energy is minimized when the charges are as close as possible, but in this case, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P. So maybe the configuration is that all 12 are arranged symmetrically around P, each at 2 meters. 

Wait, but wait. The system is isolated, so we can consider the electrostatic potential energy between all pairs of charges. But since the 13th is fixed, perhaps the energy comes from the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed one, and the interactions among the 12 themselves.

Wait, but the problem says the 1
