Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I can do. The question is about identifying the product after a reaction. Hmm, the compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an alkyne to form an alkyne diol, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, they can also be used in the dehydrohalogenation or maybe it's something else. Oh wait, I think when an alkyl halide is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's called the hydroiodide elimination reaction, which leads to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. So, it's like an elimination reaction that forms a double bond.

But before that, I need to figure out what compound X is. The question gives me the IR and NMR data, so I'll start by analyzing those.

Looking at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably from O-H or N-H stretches. But considering the options, maybe it's an O-H from a carbonyl compound. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests the presence of an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the peak is around 1720, which is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a ketone. Esters are around 1730-1750, so maybe it's an ester? Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl would have a lower wavenumber. Hmm.

Looking at the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring. Also, the peak around 1610 might indicate some conjugation, perhaps with a carbonyl group. So maybe an aromatic ester or a substituted benzene with a carbonyl group.

Now the 1H NMR data:

The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. That could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but a broad peak might suggest exchange with something, like in a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, 10.5 might be an acidic proton like a phenolic OH. But wait, phenol OH is usually around 5 ppm in D2O exchange, but if it's in DMSO or not exchanged, it could be higher. Alternatively, an aldehyde is around 9-10, but 10.5 is a bit high. Hmm.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like a pair of doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Each doublet has 2H, so maybe two substituents in the para positions. The integration is 2H each, so it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in para positions. So, perhaps a meta substitution isn't the case here.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's a multiplet. Maybe a CH group next to something deshielded, like near an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. Or perhaps a bridgehead or a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – another multiplet, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl or part of a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a triplet of doublets? Wait, no, it's a doublet. A doublet with 3H. That might be a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 or something else. Like a CH(CH3) group, perhaps. So, maybe a geminal group or part of an isopropyl or similar structure.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a triplet, but wait, a triplet in an NMR could be a terminal CH2 group. No, wait, 3H as a triplet usually indicates a CH2CH3 (ethyl) group. So that's probably an ethyl group at the end of a chain.

Putting the NMR together: there's a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. One substituent is -OCH3? No, wait, the IR didn't show a strong peak for OCH3. Alternatively, perhaps an ester group. Wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group.

Looking at the substituents on the benzene, the two groups are at para positions. Let's imagine the structure. For example, maybe there's a substituent like -COOR or -COR attached to the benzene ring.

Let's think about the aromatic peaks. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm doublets suggest that the substituents are such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. So, perhaps the substituents are two different groups in para positions. Wait, but in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the protons on the ring would be equivalent in pairs.

Wait, but the doublets have 2H each. So each substituent is in such a position that the ring's adjacent protons are split into doublets. Let's think: for a para-substituted benzene, if each substituent is electron-withdrawing, it would cause the ring to have certain coupling.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, like p-xylene. But in that case, the NMR would show two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H
