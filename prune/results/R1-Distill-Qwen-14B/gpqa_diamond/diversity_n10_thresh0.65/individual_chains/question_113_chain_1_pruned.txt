Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But carboxylic acids usually have a very broad and strong peak because of the -OH. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 is a bit lower, which might suggest something like conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an ester because esters have two carbonyl groups? No, wait, no. An ester has a carbonyl around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring, like C=C stretching. Or maybe it's an amide, but the options don't have N, so probably not. Hmm.

So, the FTIR suggests the presence of an O-H group (broad peak) and a carbonyl group (1700), maybe another group like an aromatic ring (1650). Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl,
