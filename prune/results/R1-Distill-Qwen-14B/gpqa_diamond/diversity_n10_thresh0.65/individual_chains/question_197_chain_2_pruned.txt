Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I should probably look at the spectroscopic data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me figure out what functional groups are present and the structure of the molecule.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are in the regions of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. Let me think about what each of these peaks could indicate.

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests the presence of either an -OH group (like in a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or maybe an amine. But given the other peaks, I'm leaning towards -OH. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group. This could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so that suggests the compound has a benzene ring.

So putting this together, Compound X might be a substituted benzene with a carbonyl group and possibly an -OH.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is typical of an -OH proton, especially in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet. So carboxylic acid -OH is a strong possibility here.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, if it's a doublet for two protons, maybe it's a substituent in the para position with two equivalent protons adjacent. Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene, each substituent would have two protons that are equivalent, so perhaps each set is a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent substituent.

Wait, let me think again. If the molecule is a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, for example, two substituents each in positions 1 and 3, but wait, no, para is
