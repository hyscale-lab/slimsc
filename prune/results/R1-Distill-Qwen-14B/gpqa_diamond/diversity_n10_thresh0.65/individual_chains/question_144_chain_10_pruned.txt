Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given parameters are its production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very small distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance they travel before decaying is tiny.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the mean lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over the speed of light, and c is the speed of light.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime tau? Oh yeah, the mean lifetime tau is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact relation is tau = ħ / (Γ/2), because Γ is the total decay width, which relates to the inverse of the lifetime. Or maybe it's tau = h/(Γ * something). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh right, the width Γ is equal to ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. So yes, that part is correct.

So first, I need to calculate the lifetime tau. Then, I need to find the velocity beta from the energy and mass. Oh wait, but the production energy is given as 8 GeV. So how do I find the velocity? Maybe I should calculate the relativistic gamma factor first.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m c^2. So gamma = E / (m c^2). Wait, but the units here are in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². Wait, let me get the units straight.

The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, but the unit should be GeV/c². Similarly, E_X is 8 GeV. So when I compute gamma, it's E/(m c²) but since GeV and GeV/c² are involved, the c² would cancel out in the units. Let me think: E = gamma * m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But if E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then E/(m) would have units of (GeV) / (GeV/c²) ) = c². So I need to divide by c^4? Wait, maybe I should be careful with units.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But I might not be comfortable with that yet. Alternatively, I can compute gamma using the formula gamma = E/(m c²). Let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, beta is the velocity over c. Beta can be found from beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). So let's compute that. Gamma is about 6.6667, so 1/gamma^2 is (1/44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is about 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, but beta can also be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Oh, I did that right.

So now, I have gamma ≈ 6.6667 and beta ≈ 0.9887.

Next, compute the lifetime tau. Tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV. Need to convert that to GeV to match units. Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. I remember that ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approximately 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait. No, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 /
