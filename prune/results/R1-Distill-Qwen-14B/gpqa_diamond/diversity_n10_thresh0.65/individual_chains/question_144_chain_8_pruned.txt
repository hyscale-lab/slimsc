Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay has something to do with their mean lifetime and speed. The question gives me the production energy, mass, and width of the meson, and I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, the mean decay distance, right. I think it's calculated by finding the mean lifetime of the particle and then multiplying by its velocity, then by the speed of light since distance is in meters. But wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of proper time and then calculate the distance it travels before decaying.

So the formula I remember is the mean decay distance, which is the mean lifetime multiplied by the particle's speed (which is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so we use beta times c, where beta is v/c). The mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. Oh right, the relation is tau = hbar / Gamma, where Gamma is the decay width. 

Wait, but what's Gamma here? The width given is 320 MeV. I think the decay width is related to the uncertainty principle. The mean lifetime is the inverse of the decay rate, and the decay rate is Gamma divided by something. Let me make sure. Gamma is the total decay width, which is the energy width corresponding to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The formula is tau = hbar / Gamma. But wait, sometimes Gamma is given in energy units, so we need to convert that into seconds.

Wait, no, the units might complicate
