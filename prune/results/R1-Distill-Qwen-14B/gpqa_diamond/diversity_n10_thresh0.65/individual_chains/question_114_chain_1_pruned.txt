Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Hmm, let me think step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when you have a ketone reacting with a nitrile group, I'm guessing it's some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. 

So the reaction is between a ketone and cyanide. Under what conditions does that happen? I remember that the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon. But for that, the ketone needs to be activated. Maybe an acid catalyst is used. Like, H3O+ (proton source) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack, leading to the addition product. 

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+. That makes sense because without acid, the reaction might not proceed efficiently. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid. It's used in certain reductions, like with ketones to form diols. But in this case, we're adding CN, so maybe H3O+ is better. 

So I think A is H3O+ for the first part. That would leave options A, B, C, D as possible, but A and B have A = H3O+, while C and D have A = NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under various conditions. There's the acidic hydrolysis and the basic hydrolysis. In acidic conditions, you get a carboxylic acid. In basic conditions, you get a carboxylate which can be acidified to the acid.

But in this case, the starting material is already a nitrile with a hydroxyl group (the 2-hydroxy... part). Wait, but the product is butanoic acid. So the nitrile is being converted to a COOH group. So the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

For that, the typical reagent is H2O with acid or base. Wait, the reaction is in H2O and reagent B. So which reagent drives the nitrile to carboxylic acid?

In acidic conditions, H2O with HCl (like concentrated HCl) can hydrolyze nitriles. Alternatively, under basic conditions (like NaOH), you might get the carboxylate, which upon acidification becomes the acid.

Wait, but the question says that the reagent is B (H2O). So I think B is the condition under which the
