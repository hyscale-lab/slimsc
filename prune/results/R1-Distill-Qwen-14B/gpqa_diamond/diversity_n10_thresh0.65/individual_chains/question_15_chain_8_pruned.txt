Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit from the given options. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that both Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same mass. They were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and they have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The key point here is the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet, the size of the star, and the size of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, more specifically, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / a)^2 * (something else?), wait no, I think it's more about whether the orbital plane is edge-on enough. Oh right, the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (some function), but wait maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, or something like that.

Wait, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star))², but I'm not entirely sure. But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius because it says their host stars have the same radii. So R_star is the same for both. So the R_star term cancels out in the comparison between the two.

So the main factors would be the orbital distance (a) and the planet's radius. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the planet radii. Hmm, but wait, the mass of the planets are the same. Oh wait, but mass doesn't directly translate to radius. For Earth-like planets, I suppose their radii are similar, but maybe not exactly the same. But the question states they are Earth-like, so perhaps they have similar radii. But the problem doesn't give specific data on planet sizes, so maybe I can assume they're the same. Alternatively, perhaps the question only cares about the orbital period and star mass in determining the orbital distance.

Wait, if both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods around stars of different masses. Wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. Since the planets are detected via RV, we know their orbital periods. The orbital period is related to the semi-major axis (a) and the mass of the star. Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * a³. Since the planets'
