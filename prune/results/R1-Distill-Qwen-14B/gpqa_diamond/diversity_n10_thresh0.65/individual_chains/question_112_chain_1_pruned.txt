Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> that's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix elements are given as A_ij. The A_ij matrix has elements hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D with different probabilities and average values.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's only given as proportional. Then, perhaps find the eigenstates of the operator A, and then compute the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate when the system is in |alpha>.

Wait, but wait a second. The operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j and zero otherwise. So, let's think about what this matrix looks like. Since |up> and |down> form a basis, the operator is 2x2. So:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because if i is not j, then A_ij is hbar/2. So for i=1, j=2 and vice versa. So the matrix is zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

This looks familiar. Oh, right! This is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * X.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of X, because A is a scalar multiple of X. And the eigenvalues of X are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be ±hbar/2.

So the eigenstates of A would be |+x> and |-x>, the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. These states are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, let me recall. The eigenstates of spin in the x-direction are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> -
