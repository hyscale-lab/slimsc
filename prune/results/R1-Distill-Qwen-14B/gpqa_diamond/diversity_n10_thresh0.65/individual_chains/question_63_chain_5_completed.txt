Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, the question is about what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next lowest energy state when it absorbs this photon.

Let me try to break it down. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next possible state. But wait, I should remember that in the rotation-vibration model, energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's considering the next higher energy level, whether it's a rotation or vibration transition. But I'm a bit confused here. Oh, right, in such models, sometimes you can have transitions that change both rotational and vibrational states.

But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But I think the problem is asking about the transition that requires the least energy, hence the lowest possible energy change. So that would be the smallest possible photon energy needed to get to the next state.

Wait, the molecule is in its ground vibration state and the ground rotational state. So the next state could be either moving to a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (like J=1). I think for diatomic molecules, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized, and their energies are given by specific formulas.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. The rotational energy levels are E_rotational = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. So the total energy is the sum of these two.

Now, the fundamental state would be v=0 and J=0, right? So the next possible state would either be v=1 (the first vibrational excited state) or J=1 (the first rotational state). Which transition requires less energy? Let's compute both.

The energy difference for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = h ν. For the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ΔE_rot = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) = 2B.

So we need to calculate which of these two is smaller. If ΔE_vib is less than ΔE_rot, then the photon should have energy corresponding to the vibrational transition. Otherwise, it's the rotational.

So let's compute both.

First, the given parameters are:
Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.
Angular frequency ω =4e14 rad/s.

Wait, angular frequency ω is given, so the vibrational frequency ν is ω/(2π). So ν = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

But wait, for the rotational constant B, we need the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So let's calculate μ. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) in amu. Wait, but since we're using SI units, we should convert amu to kilograms.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So,

Mx = 20 amu → 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg
My = 2 amu → 3.321e-27 kg

So μ = (20 *2 )/(20 +2) amu → (40)/(22) amu → 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, no, wait, I think I messed that up. Let me recalculate μ correctly.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) → (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert that to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ Let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg ≈ approx 3e-27 kg.

Wait, more accurately: 1.818 * 1.6605 = Let's compute 1.8 * 1.66 = approx 2.988. So 2.988e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = (3e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 12e-47 kg m² → 1.2e-46 kg m².

Wait, wait, let me compute it precisely. 3e-27 kg multiplied by (2e-10 m)^2:

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = (3e-27 kg) * 4e-20 m² = 12e-47 kg m² = 1.2e-46 kg m².

The rotational constant B is given by ħ² / (2I), but wait, no, wait. The rotational energy levels are (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1). So the rotational constant B is (ħ²/(2I)).

Wait, no, more accurately, B is given by h/(8 π² I c) times c? Or wait, perhaps I should compute it using B = (h/(8 π² I)) * (1/(2π))?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The rotational energy E_rot is given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which has units of energy per rotational quantum number.

But the formula for B is B = (ħ²)/(2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (h/(2π)).

Wait, I think that's right. So let's compute B.

ħ = h/(2π) → 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So B = (ħ²)/(2 I) → ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2e-46 kg m² )

Compute the numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 =1e-68, and 1.05^2≈1.1).

Denominator: 2 * 1.2e-46 = 2.4e-46.

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.4e-46) = approx 4.63e-23 J.

Wait, let's do that calculation more accurately.

1.0545718e-34 squared:

(1.0545718)^2 ≈ 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Divide by 2.4e-46: (1.112e-68) / 2.4e-46 = (1.112 /2.4) * 1e-22 → approx 0.463 * 1e-22 → 4.63e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait, 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22, right? Because 1e-68 / 1e-46 = 1e-22.

So B ≈ 4.63e-23 J.

Now, the energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = 2B = 2*4.63e-23 J = 9.26e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency.

ν = ω/(2π) → 4e14 / (2π) ≈ 4e14 /6.283 ≈ approx 6.366e13 Hz.

So ΔE_vib = h * ν → 6.626e-34 J·s * 6.366e13 Hz → 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈ let me compute that.

6.626e-34 *6.366e13 = (6.626 *6.366) * 1e-21.

6.626 *6 ≈39.756, 6.626 *0.366≈2.423 → total approx 42.18e-21 → 4.218e-20 J.

So ΔE_vib is about 4.22e-20 J, and ΔE_rot is about 9.26e-23 J.

Wait, 9.26e-23 is much smaller than 4.22e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transitions usually require higher energy than rotational. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the numbers.

Wait, let's recalculate B.

I = μ R² = ( (20 *2)/(20+2) ) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, μ in kilograms: 40/(22) amu = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

40/22 ≈ 1.81818. So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (1.818 *1.6605) = let's compute 1.818 *1.6605:

1.8 *1.66 = 2.988.

0.018 *1.6605≈0.0299.

Total is approximately 2.988 + 0.0299 = 3.0179e-27 kg.

Wait, so I = μ R² = 3.0179e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.0179e-27 * 4e-20 → 1.207e-46 kg m².

So I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, compute B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

2I = 2 *1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 → approximately (1.112 / 2.414) * 1e-22 → 0.4607 *1e-22 → 4.607e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot for J=0→1 is B*(2) (since E_rot = B J (J+1), so J=0: 0, J=1: 2B. So ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h ν, where ν = ω/(2π) =4e14/(2π) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So ΔE_vib = h * ν = 6.626e-34 J·s *6.366e13 Hz → 6.626e-34*6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

So comparing 4.22e-20 J (vibrational) and 9.214e-23 J (rotational), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should be absorbed to cause a rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state could be either v=1 or J=1, whichever has the lower energy transition.

Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon would be in the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy is equal to ΔE_rot =9.214e-23 J.

But the question asks for momentum, not energy. So I need to find the momentum p of the photon such that E_photon = ΔE_rot.

But wait, for a photon, E = h f = p c, where p is momentum, and c is speed of light.

So p = E/(c) = (9.214e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) → 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are in that range. Let me look at the options:

Options are from 1e-28 to 2.3e-27 N·s.

Wait, wait, that's way bigger than what I just got. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I confused the energy levels. What if the transition is from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which might involve both a vibrational and rotational change? Or perhaps the problem considers a change in both vibrational and rotational states.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy, or maybe the question is considering an entirely different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering a transition to the next state regardless of whether it's vibration or rotation. But the question is about the momentum of the photon, so let me think about which transition requires a photon with the least possible momentum (since p = E/c, lower p means lower E).

But from earlier, the rotational transition requires lower energy (so lower p) than the vibrational.

Wait, but the options are all about 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns. My calculation gives about 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s (since 1 Ns = 1 kg·m/s). But none of the options are that small. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first excited state, which is either v=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). But perhaps the problem is considering a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, another possibility: the question is actually about the transition that requires the least possible energy (lowest energy change), so whether it's a vibrational or rotational transition. Because if the photon's energy is just enough to cause the transition, then we take the lower energy. But according to our calculations, the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational.

But the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculation of B. Alternatively, maybe the question considers a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0), whichever has the lower energy.

Wait, perhaps the next state after (v=0, J=0) is (v=1, J=0), which would be a vibrational transition, or (v=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition. The one with lower energy would be the rotational transition.

But the energy of the rotational transition is much lower than the vibrational.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition's energy.

But when I computed the momentum, I got 3e-31 N·s, but the options are way larger.

Hmm. That suggests I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher state, which is (v=0, J=1), which is a pure rotational transition. Thus, the energy change is ΔE_rot =2B. So the photon's energy must be 2B.

Wait, but why the options are so big? Let me recompute B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recalculate B step by step.

B = (ħ²)/(2I)

I = μ R²

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

R =2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² → 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ = h/(2π) = (6.626e-34 Js)/(2π) ≈1.05457e-34 Js.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 →approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

Now, B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) → denominator is 2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 ≈4.61e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot = 2B =9.22e-23 J.

Photon energy E =9.22e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c →9.22e-23 J /3e8 m/s →3.07e-31 kg m/s →3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are way higher. So this suggests that perhaps the problem is asking for a transition in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor only, and not including the vibration. But the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), so that's not the case.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which is a pure vibrational transition. Then the energy would be ΔE_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.22e-20 J.

Then, the photon's momentum p = E/c =4.22e-20 /3e8 →1.407e-28 kg m/s →1.407e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. That's very close.

So perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But why? Because the rotational transition requires less energy but the photon's momentum in that case would be way smaller than any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually considering that the molecule can't undergo a pure rotational transition because it's in the ground state of the rotation. Or perhaps the problem is considering a transition to the next state (v=1, J=0), which is the next higher energy state beyond (v=0, J=0). But why would that be the case?

Wait, the energy levels are quantized, and each state has a certain energy. The order of energies might be such that some rotational states are higher in energy than some vibrational states. But I think for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are much higher than the rotational ones.

Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are much closer together than vibrational. So the transitions between rotational states require much lower energy than vibrational transitions.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the rotational transition (J=0→1) requires less energy than the vibrational (v=0→1). So why is the option with 1.4e-28 N·s (option D) present, which corresponds to the vibrational transition?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the next state. Perhaps the problem is considering the next state as the first state beyond the ground state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational.

But the question is about the photon's momentum, and if the transition is vibrational, p would be approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

But that would be if the rotational transition requires less energy, but the photon's momentum is higher for a vibrational transition. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the question mixes up the photon's momentum with other quantities. Let me compute the possible options.

Wait, given that the options are much bigger than what I calculated earlier, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) as the first possible transition. So the energy change is 2B.

But then the photon's momentum would be p = (2B)/(c) → (9.214e-23 J)/3e8 m/s ≈3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. Let me think again. The rotational energy is given by E = B J (J +1), where B = h/(8π² I c). Wait, no, I might be getting confused between rotational constants expressed in cm^-1 and others.

Wait, another formula for B is B = (h/(8 π² I)).

Wait, let me check: the rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So B in that formula is ħ²/(2I), which is what I calculated earlier.

Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but perhaps I should double-check the units.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate B in terms of angular frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the vibrational and rotational contributions to the energy and find the total energy difference.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's looking for the transition that requires the least energy, which would be the rotational one, but since that gives a p that's too small, perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

But why would the options have such a high p?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the first excited rotational state, but that can't be because the molecule is in its fundamental state.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recalculate B step by step.

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu =40/22 amu =1.81818... amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 1.81818 *1.6605 = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

R =2e-10 m.

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ = h/(2π) =6.626e-34/(2*3.1416) ≈1.05457e-34 Js.

B = ħ²/(2I) → (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 *1.2064e-46).

Calculate numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2*1.2064e-46 =2.4128e-46.

So B=1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 ≈4.61e-23 J.

So for J=1, E=2B=9.22e-23 J.

Photon energy E_photon =9.22e-23 J.

p= E_photon /c →9.22e-23 /3e8 →3.07e-31 kg m/s →3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is the same as the rotation-vibration model, which allows for the bond length to change due to vibration, affecting the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure if that affects the energy levels in a way that changes this calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the J=0 state, and the next possible state is J=1, which requires a photon of momentum p=3.07e-31 Ns, but this isn't an option.

So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state is the one with the next higher energy, but perhaps the first excited state in the model is a combination of both vibration and rotation.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a vibrational transition with the lowest J possible. Like, after (v=0, J=0), the next state is (v=1, J=0), which would have higher energy than (v=0, J=1), because the vibrational energy is higher than rotational.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the vibrational energy levels are much higher than rotational ones. So the next state after (v=0, J=0) is (v=0, J=1), which would have lower energy than (v=1, J=0).

Wait, but what's the energy of (v=0, J=1) compared to (v=1, J=0)?

Compute E1 = E_rot (J=1) =2B ≈9.22e-23 J.
E2 = E_vib (v=1) ≈4.22e-20 J.

So E1 is much smaller than E2. So the next state after (v=0, J=0) is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with E=9.22e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, the options are way too large. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but with a vibration. Oh, but no, the model is the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy levels in terms of the total energy, which includes both rotation and vibration. So the ground state is (v=0, J=0), with E= (1/2) h ν + 0 (since rotational energy at J=0 is zero).

The next possible state could be (v=1, J=0), which has E=(3/2) h ν, or (v=0, J=1), which has E= 2B.

Which is lower in energy? As before, 2B is about 9.22e-23 J, which is way less than (3/2) h ν ≈ 6.34e-20 J.

So the next state is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of 9.22e-23 J.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I've made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me check the given options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B and the corresponding photon momentum. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy. Let me compute the ratio of 2B to h ν.

2B=9.22e-23 J.
h ν=4.22e-20 J.

So 2B is roughly 0.022% of h ν. So the rotational transition requires much less energy.

But the options are all in the order of 1e-28, which is about 1e-8 times the h ν energy I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing h ν with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition as a result of photon momentum, not energy.

Wait, but the momentum of a photon is p = E/c.

So, for the rotational transition:

E_rot = 9.22e-23 J → p_rot =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s →3.07e-31 Ns.

For the vibrational transition, p_vib =4.22e-20 /3e8 ≈1.406e-28 Ns → which is option D (1.4e-28 Ns).

So the vibrational transition's photon has a momentum of approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

But why would the question suggest that the molecule transitions to the next lowest state, which would be the rotational transition, but the option corresponds to the vibrational transition.

This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition as a possible option, and is only considering the vibrational transition.

In that case, the correct option would be D.

But why would the next state be the vibrational one? Because perhaps in the model, the vibrational energy is the primary contributor, but that doesn't align with the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels in terms of the quantum numbers. The energy levels are quantized, and the order is such that (v=0, J=1) is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). So the next state after (v=0, J=0) is (v=0, J=1), but the photon required for that transition has a momentum of 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

So maybe the problem is considering a different approach, perhaps using the formula for the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational changes, but that doesn't make sense because photons have a single energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try a different approach: using the formula for the rotational constant in terms of the bond length and the reduced mass.

The rotational constant B is given by B = (h/(8 π² I c)), where c is the speed of light. Wait, no, that's the rotational constant expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1).

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in Joules. Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of cm^-1, which would require a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of the wavenumbers.

But I think the earlier approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the photon's momentum for the rotational transition, but perhaps the calculation is being done incorrectly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=1) state, which is a pure rotational transition with ΔE = 2B.

But according to my calculation, 2B is 9.22e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of B.

I = μ R².

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg → μ=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

R=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I=3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.206e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I) → (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.206e-46) →1.112e-68 /2.412e-46 →4.61e-23 J.

So 2B=9.22e-23 J. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the problem expects me to consider only the vibrational transition, giving p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

After considering all possibilities, the only option that aligns with a calculated p is option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels of the system under the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, corresponding to \(v = 0\) (ground vibrational state) and \(J = 0\) (ground rotational state). The next possible states are either \(v = 1\) (first vibrational excited state) or \(J = 1\) (first rotational excited state). The transition requiring the least energy will correspond to the photon's energy.

### Key Parameters:
- \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\)
- Bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)
- Angular frequency \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)

### Step 1: Reduced Mass and Moment of Inertia
The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
\]
Converting to kilograms:
\[
\mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

The moment of inertia \(I\) is:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Rotational Constant \(B\)
The rotational constant \(B\) is given by:
\[
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad \text{where } \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}
\]
Substituting \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(I = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2\):
\[
B = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Energy Differences
- **Rotational Transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\))**:
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.61 \times 10^{-23} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
  \]

- **Vibrational Transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\))**:
  The vibrational frequency \(\nu\) is:
  \[
  \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}
  \]
  The energy difference is:
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.37 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
  \]

### Step 4: Photon Momentum
The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c}, \quad \text{where } c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

- For the **rotational transition**:
  \[
  p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
  \]
  This value is far smaller than any of the provided options.

- For the **vibrational transition**:
  \[
  p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
  \]
  This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion
The problem likely assumes the transition corresponds to the vibrational energy difference, as the calculated momentum for the rotational transition does not match any of the given options. The vibrational transition requires a photon with momentum \(p = 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\), which aligns with **Option D**.
