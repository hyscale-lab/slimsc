Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that when dealing with particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, I should probably use relativistic equations. Oh right, the energy of a particle in relativity is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. And gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So the first step is to calculate gamma. Let's see, v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me check that calculation again. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. 1 divided by 0.28, which is the same as 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. So yes, that's correct.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy, but I think for this problem, we
