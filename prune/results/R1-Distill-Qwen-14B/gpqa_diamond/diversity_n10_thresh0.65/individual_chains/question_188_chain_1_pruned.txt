Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Alright, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals?

Rhombohedral systems are one of the seven crystal systems. I think they have all sides equal, but the angles are all the same but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, right, in a rhombohedral crystal, all edges are of equal length (a = b = c) and all three angles (α, β, γ) are equal. So in this case, the angles are 30 degrees each. The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom, which I suppose is the lattice parameter 'a' since in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a = b = c.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane. The general formula for interplanar distance (d) is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cosβ + hl cosγ + kl cosα) ) 

Wait, but wait. Because in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same (α = β = γ), so the formula might simplify. Also, since a = b = c, maybe there's a simpler version.

Alternatively, I think for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but rhombohedral is not cubic because the angles are different. So the formula must account for the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the basics. The interplanar spacing formula for a general crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = (2 * a * b * c) / sqrt( (a^2 (k^2 + l^2 - 2kl cosα)) + (b^2 (h^2 + l^2 - 2hl cosβ)) + (c^2 (h^2 + k^2 - 2hk cosγ)) )) 

Wait, no, that's not right. Another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ ( \frac{h}{a} )^2 + ( \frac{k}{b} )^2 + ( \frac{l}{c} )^2 + ( \frac{hk}{a b} \cos \gamma ) + ( \frac{hl}{a c} \cos \beta ) + ( \frac{kl}{b c} \cos \alpha ) ) } }

Wait, no, I think that's the inverse of the square root of the sum of terms. Maybe I should think of it as:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ ( \frac{h}{a} )^2 + ( \frac{k}{b} )^2 + ( \frac{l}{c} )^2 + ( \frac{hk}{a b} \cos \gamma ) + ( \frac{hl}{a c} \cos \beta ) + ( \frac{kl}{b c} \cos \alpha ) ) } }

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0
