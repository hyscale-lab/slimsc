Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same.
- Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s.
- We need to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is to find the ratio of their luminosities, L1/L2.

I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, this should apply.

Wait, but what do I know about their temperatures? Oh, the problem says they have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. I think that refers to the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. Oh right! Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. The law is λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.898 ×10^-3 m·K).

So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same as well. Because λ1 * T1 = λ2 * T2, and λ1=λ2, so T1 must equal T2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again: if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So their temperatures are equal.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Then, the luminosity depends on R squared times T to the fourth. Since T is the same, L is proportional to R².

But wait, the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So L1 = (1.5 R2)² * T^4 * constants. L2 is (R2)^2 * T^4 * constants. So the ratio L1/L2 is (1.5 R2 / R2)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25. That would suggest option
