Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum states and their lifetimes. Hmm, let me think. The question says we have two energy levels with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out the energy difference between them so they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the lifetime (τ) is greater than or equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes it's approximated as ΔE * τ ≈ ħ, or even just ΔE * τ ~ 1 in appropriate units. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

So the idea is that the longer the lifetime (the more precisely the energy is known), the smaller the uncertainty in energy. Conversely, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty. So to distinguish between two states, the energy difference between them should be larger than the uncertainty in either state's energy. Otherwise, the states would be too close to each other to resolve.

The lifetimes given are 1e-9 sec for E1 and 1e-8 sec for E2. Wait, so E2 has a longer lifetime than E1. That would mean that the uncertainty for E2 is smaller than that for E1. Because ΔE = ħ / τ. So E2 has a smaller ΔE uncertainty.

Wait no, wait: I think the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So longer lifetime means lower uncertainty. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 would be something like ħ/(2*τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 would be ħ/(2*τ2). Since τ2 is bigger, ΔE2 is smaller.

To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference |E2 - E1| must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Or maybe just greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. So |E2-E1| > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Because if it's bigger than the larger uncertainty, then it's definitely separable.

So let's compute each uncertainty. Let's compute ħ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

So for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J. Hmm, but we need this in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So dividing ΔE1 by 1.602e-19 gives the value in eV.

So ΔE1 = 1.055e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, that's about 6.58e-7 eV. So about 0.0
