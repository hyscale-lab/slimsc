Okay, so I've got this question here about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals, right. So a rhombohedron is a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. But wait, I thought in a rhombohedral system, the angles are either all 60 or 90 degrees, but maybe it's possible for them to be 30? I'm not sure, but the question states that so I'll go with that.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. I guess that's the lattice parameter 'a' since in a cubic system, the interatomic distance would be 'a' if it's simple cubic. But wait, this is rhombohedral, so maybe the lattice parameter is a bit different. Or does the interatomic distance directly correspond to 'a'? I think so, because in a simple cubic structure, the atoms are at the corners, so the distance between adjacent atoms is 'a'. So yeah, I think 'a' is 10 Angstrom here.

The question is about the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by the corresponding lattice parameters, considering the
