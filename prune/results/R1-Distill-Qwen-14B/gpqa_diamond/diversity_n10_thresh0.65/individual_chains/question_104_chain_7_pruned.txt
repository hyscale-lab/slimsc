Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits, and they're detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift here is given in milliangstroms for each planet. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. 

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D, and I need to find the correct ratio.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star in its orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2)) ) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (2π G )^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) ), but maybe I don't need to get into that much detail.

Wait, but since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets have similar masses (like Neptune), the mass terms might simplify. Also, the orbits are circular, so the eccentricity e is zero. That means the (1-e²)^(1/2) term is 1, so we can ignore that.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = [ (G * P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / [ (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + (M_p / M_star))^(1/3) ) ] * [1 / (2π)^(1/3) ]

Wait, maybe another approach. I remember a simpler relation when M_p << M_star, which is the case here since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun. So M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and (M_p / M_*) is very small, so we can approximate. 

In that case, the formula simplifies. The RV semi-amplitude K is approximately
