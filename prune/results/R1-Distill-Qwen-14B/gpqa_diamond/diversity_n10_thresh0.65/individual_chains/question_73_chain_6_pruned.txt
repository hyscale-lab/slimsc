Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, calculating speeds isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. I think you can't just subtract the speeds directly because of the Lorentz factor. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is something like (v1 - v2) divided by (1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared). Let me write that down.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula for the relative speed u between two objects moving at velocities v1 and v2 relative to a rest frame is u = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Or is it (v1 - v2)/(1 - v1 v2 / c²)? Because if both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed should be the difference of their speeds divided by something.

Let me think again. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from astronaut 2's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 1?

Wait no, the question is about the relative speed of each other. Or perhaps, the relative speed of one with respect to the other. So I think I should calculate the relative velocity using the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, no, actually, because they're moving in the same direction. So, for the relative velocity, if someone is moving at u and another at v, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²) when u and v are along the same direction.

Wait, let me confirm. The formula for the relative velocity between two objects when one is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from astronaut 2's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 1? It's going to be (0
