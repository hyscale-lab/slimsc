Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but wait, the question is about luminosity, so mass might not directly affect it. Hmm, maybe I can ignore the mass part since luminosity is more about energy output, which relates to radius and temperature.

The stars appeared brightest at the same wavelengths. Oh, right! That must mean they have the same effective temperature. Because the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars have the same temperature, the ratio of their luminosities will depend on the square of their radii. 

Wait, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. 

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the T part is (1)^4 = 1. So the ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So Star_1 should be 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2. 

Wait but the options don't have exactly 2.25 as an option. Let me check the options again. Option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23, so maybe I'm missing something. Did I consider all factors?

Wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, they've given the radial velocities as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, how does that affect the calculation?

Hmm, radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift. Oh wait, the observed wavelength would be shifted due to their velocities. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. 

So the observed maximum wavelength (lambda_obs) for each star would be lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) or something like that, depending on the relativistic effect. But wait, since Star_1 has velocity 0, its emitted wavelength is the same as the observed. But Star_2 is moving away (since velocity is positive 700 km/s), so its observed wavelength would be longer. 

Wait, but the problem says both stars have same observed lambda_max. So that must mean that their emitted wavelengths are different. Because Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda is longer, implying that its emitted lambda must be shorter. Because of the Doppler shift, so that when you apply the redshift, it becomes the same as Star_1's observed wavelength.

Ah, so if Star_1 has a velocity of 0, its emitted lambda is lambda1. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its emitted lambda is lambda2, but when observed, it's stretched to lambda1 because lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds (since 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light, but maybe we can approximate using the relativistic formula or not? Hmm, maybe it's better to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. The formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Alternatively, if the velocities are small compared to the speed of light, we can approximate using (1 + v/c), but 700 km/s is 0.00233c, because speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 is 0.00233 times c. That's 0.233% of c. So maybe the non-relativistic approximation is good enough, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact formula.

But let's think about this. Since both stars have the same observed lambda_max, let's say lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. So lambda1_emit * (1 - v1/c) = lambda2_emit * (1 + v2/c). Wait, no, wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c) when moving away (v positive). Wait, actually, no: the formula depends on whether the source is moving away or towards us. So the correct formula is:

If the source is moving away with velocity v, lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c). But wait, this is non-relativistic. The relativistic formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving away (v is positive) is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, I think the exact formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * ( (1 + v/c) ) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) ). Hmm, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. 

The relativistic Doppler shift for frequency is f_obs = f_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), because when the source moves away, the observed frequency decreases. For wavelength, since wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ).

So in this case, Star_1 has v1 = 0. So lambda1_obs = lambda1_emit. 

Star_2 has v2 = 700 km/s away, so lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same: lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So,

lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But lambda is proportional to 1/T (Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T). So we can write lambda1_emit = b / T1, lambda2_emit = b / T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 = T2 because their observed lambda_max is same. Wait, but no, that's not correct. Because observed lambda is lambda_emit * Doppler factor. So if they have the same observed lambda, but their emitted lambdas are different.

So let me correct that. Since they are black bodies, their emitted spectra have peaks at lambda_emit = b / T.

So, for Star_1, lambda1_emit = b / T1.

For Star_2, lambda2_emit = b / T2.

But since Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

And since lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs,

lambda1_emit = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Substituting lambda1_emit and lambda2_emit,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

The b's cancel out.

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Take reciprocal of both sides,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

Hmm, so the temperatures are different. So earlier assumption that T1 = T2 was wrong because I didn't account for the Doppler shift. Oh, this complicates things. So the stars' actual temperatures are different, but when observed, their maximum wavelengths appear the same. So their emitted wavelengths are different, but due to the Doppler effect, they appear the same in our observations.

So, now I can't assume T1 = T2. I need to find the actual temperatures, or the ratio T1/T2.

Let me compute the ratio T1/T2.

From the equation,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

Compute v2 = 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) ≈ 0.9976667

(1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.0023333

Compute the ratio: 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ (let me compute this) 

0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ let's compute numerator and denominator as fractions. Let me approximate 0.9976667 ≈ 0.9977, denominator 1.0023333 ≈ 1.0023.

Now 0.9977 / 1.0023 ≈ I can compute this as approximately (1 - 0.0023) / (1 + 0.0023) ≈ (approx 1 - 2 * 0.0023) using the approximation (1+x)/(1-y) ≈ 1 + x + y when x and y are small. But maybe a better approach is to compute it numerically.

Compute 0.9977 / 1.0023.

Let me compute 0.9977 / 1.0023 ≈ (approx 0.9977 * 1.0000 / (1.0023)) ) 

Wait, 1.0023 is approximately 1 + (0.0023), so 1/(1.0023) ≈ 1 - 0.0023 + (0.0023)^2 - ... approximately 0.99771.

So multiplying 0.9977 * 0.99771 ≈ (approx 0.9977 * 0.9977 is approx 0.9954 )

Wait, maybe I should just compute it directly.

0.9977 divided by 1.0023.

Let me compute 1.0023 * 0.995 = 1.0023 * 0.995 = (1 * 0.995) + (0.0023 * 0.995) ) = 0.995 + 0.0022885 ≈ 0.9972885. Hmm, that's less than 0.9977. So 0.995 *1.0023=0.9972885.

We have 0.9977 ≈ 0.9972885 + 0.0004115. How much more do I need to add? Let's see, each 0.0001 of x in (1.0023 * x) would contribute 0.0001 *1.0023 = 0.00010023 to the product.

We need an additional 0.0004115 beyond 0.995. So 0.0004115 / 0.00010023 ≈ 4.106. So x ≈ 0.995 + 0.0004106 ≈ 0.9954106.

So 1.0023 * 0.9954106 ≈ 0.9977.

So the ratio 0.9977/1.0023 ≈ approx 0.9954.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because 0.9977 / 1.0023 is approximately 0.9954.

So sqrt(0.9954) = square root of 0.9954. Let me compute that. 

The square of 0.997 is 0.994009, 0.9975^2 = (0.997 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.994009 + 2 * 0.997 * 0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 ≈ 0.994009 + 0.000997 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.995006.

Hmm, close to 0.9954. So the square of 0.9977 is about 0.9954. Wait, wait, 0.9977^2 is (approx) (1 - 0.0023)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0023 + (0.0023)^2 ≈ 0.995429, which is about 0.995429, which is just a bit higher than 0.9954.

Wait, so sqrt(0.9954) is approximately 0.9977, because (0.9977)^2 ≈ 0.995429. So sqrt(0.9954) ≈ 0.9977.

Wait, no, wait. Because sqrt(0.9954) is the value we're trying to find. Let me think differently.

We have x = 0.9954. What's sqrt(x)?

We know that sqrt(0.9954) = 0.9977 approximately. Because 0.9977^2 is 0.995429. So yes, sqrt(0.9954) ≈ 0.9977.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ 0.9977.

So T1 = T2 * 0.9977.

Wait, but wait: T1 is the temperature of Star_1, which has a larger radius. But earlier I thought the temperatures were the same, but because of the Doppler shift, they're not. Now, with the Doppler effect, the actual temperature of Star_1 is a bit lower than Star_2.

But wait, let me recheck. The equation we derived was T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) ), which is T2 * 0.9977. So T1 is less than T2. But that's a bit counterintuitive, because Star_1 is more massive and larger, but perhaps that's just because of the Doppler effect. Or maybe not, but let's proceed.

So, now, the luminosity formula is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴ ) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = 0.9977 T2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (0.9977)^4 )

Calculating each part:

(1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(0.9977)^4: Let's compute this. 0.9977^2 is approximately 0.995429. Then (0.995429)^2 is approximately (0.99086). Let me compute 0.995429 * 0.995429:

= (1 - 0.004571)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004571 + (0.004571)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009142 + 0.0000209 ≈ 0.9908789.

So (0.9977)^4 ≈ (0.9977^2)^2 ≈ 0.9954^2 ≈ 0.9909.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9909 ≈ 2.2285.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.23, option A is 2.25.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me compute (0.9977)^4 more accurately.

Another approach is to compute ln(0.9977). ln(0.9977) is approximately -0.002303.

Multiply by 4: -0.009212.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.009212) ≈ 1 - 0.009212 + (0.009212)^2/2 ≈ 1 - 0.009212 + 0.0000422 ≈ 0.99083.

So (0.9977)^4 ≈ 0.99083.

So 2.25 * 0.99083 ≈ 2.2283.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So, the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
2. **Observed Wavelengths**: The stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths, implying their observed maximum wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same.
3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has \( v_1 = 0 \), and Star_2 has \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
4. **Doppler Shift**: The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the relativistic Doppler formula:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
   \]
   Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is the same for both stars, the emitted wavelengths must satisfy:
   \[
   \lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
   \]
5. **Wien's Law**: The peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]
   Substituting into the Doppler equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
   \]

### Temperature Ratio:
- \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), so \( v_2/c \approx 0.00233 \).
- Substituting into the temperature ratio:
  \[
  \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.00233}{1 + 0.00233}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.99767}{1.00233}}
  \]
  Approximating:
  \[
  \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \sqrt{0.9954} \approx 0.9977
  \]

### Luminosity Ratio:
The luminosity ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]
- \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \), so \( \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25 \).
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 0.9977 \), so \( \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.9977)^4 \approx 0.9908 \).

Substituting:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9908 \approx 2.2285
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2.
