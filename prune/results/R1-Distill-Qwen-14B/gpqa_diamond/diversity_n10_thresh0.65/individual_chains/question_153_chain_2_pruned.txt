Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, resulting in the formation of an enolate intermediate. So, in each of these parts (A, B, and C), I need to figure out what the reactants are and what the major products would be.

Looking at the first part: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I think NaOEt is a strong base, which probably deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a good dienophile in some reactions, but here it's acting as a nucleophile. So, the enolate from malonate (which has two ester groups) will attack the acrylate. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) with a methyl ester. Hmm, no, wait. The structure should be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OR. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the 3 position, which is the alpha to the carbonyl. Oh wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so the substituent on the acrylate would be on the alpha carbon. Oh wait, no, wait. The structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the formula for acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- something. So, 3-(p-tol
