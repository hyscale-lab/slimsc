Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that the electron state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so I need to normalize this state first, right? Because when we talk about probabilities, the state has to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares (or magnitudes squared) of the coefficients should be 1.

So |alpha> is given as proportional, which means it's not necessarily normalized yet. Let me write down the coefficients. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> it's (2-i). To normalize, I need to compute the sum of the absolute squares of these coefficients and then divide each by that sum.

The absolute square of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + bi|^2 is a^2 + b^2. Similarly, for (2-i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2-i)/√7 |down>.

Wait, but the problem is about the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator. The operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Oh, so it's a 2x2 matrix because we have two states |up> and |down>.

Wait, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, that's correct because when i≠j, it's ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are zero. Hmm. Hmm, what's the significance of this operator? Oh, right, because the eigenstates of this operator are not the same as |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli x matrix multiplied by some factors, perhaps.

Wait, Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So if our operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its eigenstates would be the same as the eigenstates of Pauli X, which are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. Those are the eigenstates for the Pauli X operator, so for A, they should also be the same, just scaled by a factor.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2. So the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), because the eigenvalues of Pauli X are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A are ±ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem is
