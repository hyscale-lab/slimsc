Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where the given density matrix ρ is located in qubit space. The matrix is given as ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But wait, this looks like a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. So it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

I think the density matrix for a pure state like |0⟩ is just |0⟩⟨0|, which would correspond to the Bloch vector pointing along the z-axis at (0,0,1). Similarly, |1⟩ is (0,0,-1), but wait, maybe it's (0,0,1) since sometimes the Bloch sphere uses +z for |0⟩ and -z for |1⟩. But when you have a mix of |0⟩ and |1⟩ each with probability 1/2, the density matrix becomes (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. 

Wait, how does this translate to the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector represents the density matrix in a vector form. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

So if I expand the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2. 

Wait, so ρ = I/2. Now, using the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, I can equate this to I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So the Bloch vector r must be zero. 

Wait, so the Bloch vector is at the origin. But the options don't have (0,0,0) as the only option. Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the position in qubit space would be the origin. 

Alternatively, I might have mixed up something. Let me think again. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent a qubit state. For a pure state |0⟩, the vector is (0,0,1), and |1⟩ is (0,0,-1). But for the completely mixed state, it's in the center, so (0,0,0). So option C is correct.

Another way to think: the density matrix for a completely mixed state is I/d, where d is the dimension. For a qubit, d=2, so it's I/2. The Bloch sphere's center is at r=0, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state, so yes, the position is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. 

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r}\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\rho = I/2\), which implies that the term \(\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\) must vanish. This means the Bloch vector \(\vec{r}\) is zero. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, a zero Bloch vector corresponds to the origin, which represents the completely mixed state. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).
