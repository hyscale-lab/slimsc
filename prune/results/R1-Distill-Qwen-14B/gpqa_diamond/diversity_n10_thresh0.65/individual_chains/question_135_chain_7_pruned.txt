Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson X. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused by the notation here. Oh, right, lambda is the coupling constant, f and f-bar are fermion fields, and X is the boson field. The term looks like it's describing some interaction between X and fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, the total energy must be at least the sum of the rest mass energies of the fermions. Because energy and momentum must be conserved, right? So, the mass of X (which is 6 GeV) must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion it's decaying into. Because each fermion will have mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

But wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV (≈0.0022 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (≈0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (≈0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): Way too heavy, like ~173 GeV. But wait, the X mass is only 6 GeV, so top quarks are out of the question.

Wait, but X has a mass of 6 GeV. So, for each fermion f, 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. That means m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's go through each possible fermion pair:

1. Electron (e) and positron (e⁺): m_e is negligible, so 2m_e << 6 GeV. So X can decay into e⁺e⁻.

2. Muon (μ) and antimuon (μ⁺): m_μ is about 0.1057 GeV. 2m_μ is ~0.2114 GeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So μ⁺μ⁻ is allowed.

3. Tau (τ) and antitau (τ⁺): m_τ is ~1.777 GeV. 2m_τ is ~3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ⁺τ⁻ decay is allowed.

4. For quarks:
   - u and u-bar: m_u is ~0.0022 GeV. 2m_u is ~0.0044 GeV, so allowed.
   - d and d-bar: m_d ~0.0047 GeV. 2m_d ~0.0094 GeV, allowed.
   - s and s-bar: m_s ~0.095 GeV. 2m_s ~0.19 GeV, allowed.
   - c and c-bar: m_c ~1.275 GeV. 2m_c ~2.55 GeV, which is less
