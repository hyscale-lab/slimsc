Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits. Let me think.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, wait, no, the way it's phrased is that it can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So that would be stars with V magnitudes ≤17, because lower numbers are brighter. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V ≤16.

So any star that has V magnitude ≤16 would be observable by both, because HIRES can go down to 16, and ESPRESSO can go down to 17. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. No, because if a star is brighter than 16 (V ≤16), then it's observable by HIRES, but what about ESPRESSO? Since ESPRESSO can go up to 17, any star with V ≤17 would be observable by ESPRESSO. So for a star to be observable by both, its V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go down to 17. So to be observed by both, the star's V must be ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again. It says, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, is that brighter than 17, which would be V < 17? Or is it magnitude brighter than 17, which would be fainter? Because magnitude is inverse. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's V is brighter than 17, that means their apparent magnitude is less than 17.

So for ESPRESSO, stars with V ≤17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with V ≤16 can be observed.

So a star must have V ≤16 to be observed by both. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So any star that is brighter than 16 (V ≤16) can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's think in terms of numbers. Suppose a star has V=15: that's brighter than 16, so it can be observed by HIRES, and it's also brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So yes, V ≤16 is the condition for both.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So each star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes given, and others have apparent magnitudes. So I need to compute the apparent magnitudes for stars where it's not given.

Let me list the stars:

Star1: Absolute V=15.5, distance=10 pc. Apparent V is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, log10(1) is 0. So m=15.5
