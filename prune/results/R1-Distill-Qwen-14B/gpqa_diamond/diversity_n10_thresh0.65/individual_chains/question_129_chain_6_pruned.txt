Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a reaction scheme with compounds A to E. The goal is to identify compound E based on the reactions and the given hints.

First, let me list out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, there are some hints:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one E is.

Hmm, right. Let's start by breaking down each step.

First, reaction 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN is typically used in the cyanohydrin reaction or maybe for forming nitriles. Wait, but HCN adding to a carbonyl would form a cyanohydrin. So if A is reacting with HCN, maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde.

But wait, when aldehydes or ketones react with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde, but let's see further steps.

Next reaction: B is reduced with H2 and Pd (probably a catalyst for hydrogenation) to form C. Pd with H2 is typically for hydrogenation, maybe of triple bonds or double bonds.

So if B is a nitrile-containing compound, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) would be hydrogenated to an am
