Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? So the pp chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, II, and III branches must be different steps or sub-reactions in this process.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various reactions. I remember that the dominant source is the proton-proton chain, which produces electron neutrinos. The specific reactions include things like two protons fusing to form deuterium and a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, the pp-III branch must be one of the later steps in that chain.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that means the reactions that were producing neutrinos via that branch will suddenly cease. How does that affect the neutrino flux we receive on Earth?

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out which of these bands are affected more when pp-III stops.

Let me recall: in the pp chain, the neutrinos produced have certain energy distributions. I think the main neutrinos are from the reactions where a boron-8 nucleus decays into helium-4 plus a neutrino. Boron-8 has a higher mass, so the neutrinos emitted would have higher energies compared to the earlier stages.

Wait, the
