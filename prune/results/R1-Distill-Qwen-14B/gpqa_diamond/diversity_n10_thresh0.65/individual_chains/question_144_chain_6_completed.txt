--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance for a meson X. They give me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all with different values in meters, some in 10^-16 and others in 10^-15.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the farther it can travel. But how do I calculate that?

Oh, right! The mean lifetime (which I think is called the proper lifetime) is given by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant and Γ is the decay width. But wait, the decay width is in the denominator, so a larger Γ means a shorter lifetime, which makes sense because a larger width implies a shorter lifetime (since the particle is decaying more quickly).

But wait, wait. I think I might be mixing things up. Oh no, wait: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime is the uncertainty in time. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find out how far the particle travels on average before decaying. The mean decay distance would be the product of the velocity of the particle and the lifetime, right? So d = v * τ.

But wait, the particle is moving, so the velocity depends on its energy and mass. Hmm, but what's the relation between energy, mass, and velocity?

The particle's energy E is given. I think I should use the relativistic energy equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Since E is the total energy, and p is the momentum.

So first, I can find the momentum p from E and m. But wait, the units here: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c²? Because mass in natural units is GeV/c². Oh wait, so perhaps I should work in units where c is 1. Because in particle physics, a lot of the calculations are done in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I might need to convert them back at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocity beta (β) as v/c. Because beta is just v/c, so v = βc.

Wait, I think the momentum p is given by gamma m v, but in terms of beta, p = gamma m v = gamma m β c. Wait, but gamma is E/(m c²) when E is in terms of relativistic energy. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute beta first.

Alternatively, since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, I can solve for p:

p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c

Wait, but I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me think about the units. GeV is energy, so E is in GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So when I square E, I get (GeV)^2, and (m c^2)^2 is (GeV)^2 as well. So the units should work out when I calculate p in GeV/c.

Wait, let me write this equation again:

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (p c)^2 = E² − (m c^2)^2 → p² c² = E² − m^2 c^4 → p² = (E² − m² c^4) / c² → p = sqrt( (E² − m² c^4) ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, let me make sure:

Wait, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (p c)^2 = E² − (m c²)^2 → p c = sqrt(E² − (m c²)^2) → p = sqrt(E² − (m c²)^2) / c.

But wait, E and m are in GeV. Hmm, but I think when using natural units where c=1, E in GeV, m in GeV/c², but I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to compute everything in terms of beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocity beta as:

beta = v/c = (E^2 − (m c^2)^2)^½ / (E) * c^2 ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The beta (β) is v/c, and in terms of energy and mass, I can write:

gamma = E/(m c²) → but since E is given, and m is given, perhaps I can compute gamma.

Wait, let's compute gamma. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E is 8 GeV, so gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma ≈ 6.6667.

Then beta can be calculated from gamma, because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So:

gamma² = 1 / (1 - beta²) → 1 - beta² = 1 / gamma² → beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/( (8 / 1.2 )^2 )) → Wait no, gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666..., so gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 ≈ 44.4444.

So beta squared = 1 - 1/44.4444 ≈ 1 - 0.0225 ≈ 0.9775 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute gamma more precisely. Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/(1.2) = 6.666666... So gamma is 6.6666666667.

So gamma squared is (6.6666666667)^2 = 44.444444444.

So 1/gamma squared is 1/44.444444444 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. Let me compute that more accurately.

Hmm, sqrt(0.9775). Let's see: 0.9887² is approximately (0.9887)^2 ≈ 0.9775. So yeah, beta is around 0.9887.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, but Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, ħ has units of GeV·s when using natural units where c=1 and ħ=6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, let me get the value of ħ in GeV·s: ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute that:

τ = (6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) → The GeV units cancel, so τ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 → Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, no: wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 → which is approximately 20.56875 * 1e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32:

0.32 × 20 = 6.4, which is close to 6.582. So 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582. So yeah, 6.582/0.32 = 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → Let me think. 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. That makes sense.

So τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance is d = v * τ. v is beta c. So let me compute that.

v ≈ 0.9887 c. Let me compute beta*c first. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So beta * c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, d = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → Let me compute that.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) ) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.966 * 2.056875. Let's see: 3 * 2.056 is about 6.168, but 2.966 is a bit less than 3. Let's compute it more accurately.

2.966 * 2.056875. Let's break it down:

2.056875 × 2.966 = ?

Let me compute 2 × 2.056875 = 4.11375

0.9 × 2.056875 = 1.8511875

0.066 × 2.056875 ≈ 0.13575.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as 2.056875 × 2.966:

2.056875 * 2 = 4.11375

2.056875 * 0.9 = 1.8511875

2.056875 * 0.06 = 0.1234125

2.056875 * 0.006 = 0.01234125

Adding all together: 4.11375 + 1.8511875 = 5.9649375 + 0.1234125 = 6.08835 + 0.01234125 ≈ 6.09989125.

So 6.09989125 × 1e-16 meters → approximately 6.0999e-16 m.

Wait, but wait a second. That's not matching any of the options. The options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, etc. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I computed gamma as E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

Then, beta squared = 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - 1/(44.44444444) → 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Wait, wait, 1/(gamma squared) is 1/( (8 / 1.2 )^2 ) = 1/( (20/3)^2 ) = 9/400 = 0.0225. So yes, that's correct.

So beta squared is 0.9775, so beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use a more precise value for sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

I know that sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99, so 0.9775 is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Wait, 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 → 0.98² = 0.9604, 2*0.98*0.008=0.01568, 0.008²=0.000064 → total 0.9604+0.01568=0.97608 + 0.000064=0.976144. Which is less than 0.9775.

Hmm, 0.988^2 =0.976144.

What about 0.989^2: (0.98 + 0.009)^2 → 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.009 = 0.01764 → 0.9604 + 0.01764 = 0.97804, plus 0.009²=0.000081 → 0.978121. So 0.989^2 is 0.978121, which is higher than 0.9775. So the square of 0.988 is 0.976144, and 0.9885^2 would be?

Let me compute 0.9885^2:

= (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 → 0.988^2 + 2*(0.988)*(0.0005) + (0.0005)^2 → 0.976144 + (0.00988) + 0.00000025 → 0.976144 + 0.00988=0.986024 + 0.00000025≈0.98602425. No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, 0.988^2 is 0.976144. Let's compute 0.988^2 = 0.976144.

Wait, but I'm trying to get to 0.9775. So 0.988^2 is 0.976144. Let me see how much more I need.

The difference between 0.9775 and 0.976144 is 0.001356.

So how much delta x do I need to add to 0.988 to get from 0.976144 to 0.9775.

Using linear approximation, sqrt(x0 + Δx) ≈ sqrt(x0) + (Δx)/(2 * sqrt(x0)).

Here, x0 = 0.976144, and Δx = 0.001356.

So sqrt(x0 + Δx) ≈ sqrt(x0) + (Δx)/(2*sqrt(x0)).

So sqrt(0.976144 + 0.001356) ≈ 0.988 + (0.001356)/(2 * 0.988).

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.988 = 1.976.

So 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ 0.000686.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686. So I can take beta as approximately 0.9887, which is what I did earlier.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * c. c is 3e8 m/s, so v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ was calculated as approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So d = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → Let's compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.103 → but wait, earlier I thought that was about 6.0999. Let me compute it again.

2.056875 * 2.966 → Let me compute 2 * 2.966 = 5.932.

0.056875 * 2.966 → Let's compute 0.05 * 2.966 = 0.1483; 0.006875 * 2.966 ≈ 0.02034625. So total 0.1483 + 0.02034625 ≈ 0.16864625.

Adding to 5.932, we get 5.932 + 0.16864625 ≈ 6.09999996 → approximately 6.100.

So 6.100e-16 meters. So d ≈ 6.1e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. But none of the options are about 6e-16 m. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6e-16 m, but the closest option is A (5.0223e-16) or D (4.0655e-16). Neither is 6e-16. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Wait, E is the production energy, but is that the total energy, or just the kinetic energy? Because if E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be K + m c², which could change things.

Wait, the question states that E_X is 8 GeV. I'm assuming that's the total energy. But perhaps I should double-check. Because if E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy is E + m c² = 8 GeV + 1.2 GeV = 9.2 GeV.

Wait, that's a big difference. Because if E is the kinetic energy, then gamma would be E_total/(m c²) = (8 + 1.2)/(1.2) )= 9.2/1.2 ≈ 7.6667.

So wait, I think I made a mistake there. The problem says E_X is the production energy. So I need to clarify whether E_X is the total energy or just the kinetic energy. This is a crucial point.

In particle physics, when someone says the production energy, I'm pretty sure they mean the total energy of the particle. So E_X is the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic.

So in that case, my initial calculation was correct with gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Wait, but perhaps I should re-calculate using E as the total energy. Let me proceed.

Wait, but let me think again. If the production energy is the kinetic energy, then E = K = (gamma - 1) m c². So gamma = (E + m c²)/m c² = (8 + 1.2)/1.2 = 9.2/1.2 = 7.6667.

So perhaps that's where I made a mistake. If E is K, then gamma would be higher, leading to a higher beta, which would increase the decay distance.

Wait, but which is it? The question says E_X is the production energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I think in this context, E_X is the total energy, but I'm not 100% certain.

But let me proceed with both possibilities.

Case 1: E is the total energy. Gamma = E/(m c²) = 8/1.2 = 6.6667. Beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) ≈ 0.9887. Then, as before, d ≈ 6.1e-16 m.

Case 2: E is the kinetic energy. Then E = K = (gamma - 1) m c² → gamma = (E + m c²)/(m c²) = (8 + 1.2)/1.2 = 9.2/1.2 ≈7.6667.

Then beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) → gamma^2 is (7.6667)^2 ≈58.7778.

So 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.01702 → 1 - 0.01702 = 0.98298 → beta = sqrt(0.98298) → approx 0.99145.

So v = 0.99145 c ≈ 0.99145 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.974e8 m/s.

Then, tau is the same, 2.056875e-24 s.

d = v * tau = 2.974e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

2.974e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.974 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.974 * 2.056875. Let's compute 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625. Subtract (0.026 * 2.056875), which is approximately 0.05347875. So 6.170625 - 0.05347875 ≈6.117146.

So d ≈6.117e-16 m.

Hmm, that's still around 6e-16 m, which isn't matching any of the options. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the decay width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So when I calculate tau, I used ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV gives 2.056e-24 s.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the natural unit system more carefully. Let me re-calculate tau.

In natural units (c=1, ħ=1), the lifetime is tau = ħ / (Gamma) → but when converting back to SI units, I need to account for the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute tau in seconds, considering the natural units. Let me re-express everything.

Gamma (Γ) is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

In natural units, ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Gamma → (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → tau = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s = 2.056875e-24 s.

That part seems correct.

Now, v is beta c, where beta is 0.9887, so 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So d = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

As before, 2.966 *2.056875 ≈6.100 → 6.1e-16 m.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in handling the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay length using the relativistic formula that includes gamma. Another approach: the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, because tau is the proper time, and the particle's lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So L = v * gamma tau → because v = beta c, and the lifetime is gamma tau.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

But tau is the proper time, so L = beta gamma c tau.

So perhaps I should compute it as L = beta gamma c (ħ / (Gamma)).

But wait, how does that fit in with the earlier approach.

Wait, tau is proper time, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.

So the lab frame lifetime is t = gamma tau.

The distance traveled is v t = beta c * gamma tau = beta gamma c tau.

So L = beta gamma c (ħ / Gamma).

Hmm, perhaps that's a better way to compute.

So, let me compute beta gamma.

Earlier, gamma was 6.6667, beta was 0.9887. So beta gamma ≈ 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6.

Wait, 0.9887 * 6.6667 → let's compute that.

0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322, 0.9887 * 0.6667≈0.6591 → total approx 6.5913.

So beta gamma ≈6.5913.

So L = beta gamma c (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, but ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, putting it all together:

L = (beta gamma) * c * ( ħ / Gamma )

But wait, that would be:

beta gamma * c * ( 6.582e-25 GeV s ) / (0.32 GeV)

The GeV units cancel, so:

L = beta gamma * c * (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

So:

L = (6.5913) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s)

Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, because beta gamma is about 6.5913, so:

L = 6.5913 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ?

Wait, no, that can't be right because I'm including c in the calculation again.

Wait, no. Because in the formula, L = beta gamma c tau, and tau is in seconds.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly.

Wait, tau is the proper time, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is t = gamma tau.

The distance is v t = beta c * gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

But tau is ħ / Gamma → 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = beta gamma c tau = (0.9887 * 6.6667) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Compute beta gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈6.5913.

So:

L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers: 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97739 * 2.056875 ≈4.065.

So L≈4.065e-15 m.

Wait, that's option B or C. Let me check the options again.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which matches this calculation.

But wait, earlier I thought I had a different approach, but perhaps using the correct formula with beta gamma c tau gives the right answer.

So where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I think I forgot to account for the gamma factor correctly in the first approach. Because the first approach used v as 0.9887 c and tau as 2.056875e-24 s, which would give 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = about 6e-16 m, but that doesn't match any option.

But when I use L = beta gamma c tau, the result is about 4.065e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but why is this different?

Ah, I think because I forgot to include gamma when calculating the lab frame lifetime. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau.

So in the first approach, I used v*tau, where tau was the proper time. But actually, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, so the correct distance is v * gamma tau, which is beta gamma c tau. So that's where I went wrong initially.

So that's why the answer comes out to about 4.065e-15 m, which matches option B.

Wait, but wait another thing: when I calculated beta gamma as 6.5913, and then multiplied by c (3e8 m/s) and tau (2.056875e-24 s), I get:

6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.5913 * (3e8 * 2.056875e-24) → 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Then 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 = (6.5913 * 6.170625) )e-16.

Compute 6 * 6.170625=37.02375.

0.5913 *6.170625 ≈3.646.

So total approx 40.66975e-16 m → 4.066975e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relativistic formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck's constant,
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the particle is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its rest mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the definition of \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
The relationship between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma^2 = (6.6667)^2 \approx 44.4444 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \beta \gamma \)
Using \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \) and \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma \approx 6.5913 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \times (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s})
\]

First, compute \( 6.5913 \times 3 = 19.7739 \), and then:

\[
L = 19.7739 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{m}
\]

\[
L = (19.7739 \times 2.056875) \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

\[
L \approx 40.655 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
