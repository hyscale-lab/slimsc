Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I should remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, right? So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz.

In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM, so I think the operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. That would mean operators are built from Lorentz-invariant combinations of fields.

Now, what about Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, which relate to momentum conservation. SMEFT operators are local, so they should respect momentum conservation. Oh wait, but waitâ€”if the theory respects Poincare symmetry, then the operators must be Poincare-invariant. But I'm not entirely sure. Or does SMEFT not necessarily require all operators to have a particular momentum dependence? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's supposed to describe physics up to a certain scale. So the operators are local, and local operators in a Lorentz-invariant theory would respect Poincare symmetry. Or maybe the Poincare symmetry isn't a separate requirement but is included because of Lorentz plus translation symmetry, which is part of the framework.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must be Lorentz-invariant, but do they all have to be Poincare-invariant?

I think Poincare symmetry is automatically satisfied if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. But in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect momentum conservation, which is tied to translations. But I'm not entirely clear whether the SMEFT requires all operators to be separately translation-invariant. Maybe I should think about the structure of the operators.

In SMEFT, operators are written as local terms, so they should respect all the symmetries that the Standard Model respects, except for those broken by the higher-dimensional terms added. The SM respects both Lorentz and Poincare, so SMEFT should as well. So operators are required to be Lorentz-invariant, which implies they are built from Lorentz scalars. But Poincare includes translations, so if the operators are local, they should conserve momentum, but perhaps each operator doesn't need to be invariant under Poincare as a whole, but rather the entire theory should be. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for other clues.

Next, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The SM respects these, except for certain cases like in the CKM matrix where CP is violated. Wait, but the SM does respect CPT symmetry, right? So if the SMEFT is built to respect the symmetries of the SM, then operators should respect the same. But wait, the SMEFT can include operators that violate certain symmetries, depending on what new physics is being modeled. Wait no, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, SMEFT is a framework where you can include various types of operators, but the ones that are allowed must be consistent with certain symmetries. For example, the operators must be renormalizable-like (though not exactly renormalizable), but more importantly, their dimensionality and structure must align with the symmetries.

So Lorentz symmetry is a must. What about Poincare? Since Lorentz and translation symmetries together make up Poincare. So if the operators are local, they would respect translation symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Now, what about CP and CPT? The Standard Model doesn't require CP symmetry; there's CP violation. So SMEFT operators can have terms that violate CP. So the operators don
