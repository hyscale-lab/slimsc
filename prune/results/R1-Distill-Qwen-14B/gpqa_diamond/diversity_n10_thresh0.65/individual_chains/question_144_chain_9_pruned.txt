Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given the production energy, mass, and width. I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and the speed at which it travels. 

First, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. Oh right, because the mean lifetime is related to the width of the particle. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is connected to the particle's lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I recall is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So, τ is ħ divided by Γ. 

Wait, but wait. No, actually, I think the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle with a width Γ, which is the uncertainty in energy ΔE, the uncertainty in time Δt is ħ/(2Γ). But in particle physics, I think the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ/Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). So I'll go with that. 

Then, once I have the lifetime, I need to find out how fast the meson is moving. Because the decay distance is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. So the mean decay length L is v * τ. 

How do I find the velocity? I think I can get it from the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The mass of the meson is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the momentum p using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². 

Wait, let me write that equation correctly. The energy E is the total energy, so E² = (pc)² c² + (m c²)². So, E² = p² c^2 + m² c^4. Rearranging for p: p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / (c^2). Wait, no, let me do it right. Let me square both sides:

E² = (p c)² + (m c²)². So, p c = sqrt(E
