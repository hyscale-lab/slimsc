Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, so first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to their components. Since the problem is about a muon, which is a lepton, but maybe that doesn't matter here. The operator in question is for spin, perhaps? Because spin operators often have eigenvalues like ħ/2 times ±1.

So, the problem gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So the matrix for Px is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Wait, so each of these is a Pauli matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are σx= [[0,1],[1,0]], σy= [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz= [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, P equals (ħ/2) times σ · n, where n is the direction vector. But in this case, n is in the x-z plane, so it has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, because in spherical coordinates, the direction vector when restricted to x-z plane would have φ=0 or π, so cosφ=1 or -1. So, maybe n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

But wait, the operator is P = (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz). And we're to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So,

( (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get:

(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, we need to find the eigenvector of the matrix (n_x σx + n_z σz) with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but matrices σx and σz don't commute, so their sum's eigenvalues would depend on their combination. Alternatively, perhaps we can diagonalize this matrix.

But another approach: since the operator is proportional to the spin in direction n, the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2), and the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

So, to
