Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, I remember that in the stellar photosphere, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on their temperatures.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy of the level, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of n1 to n2. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature changes, which affects the ratio. The ratio decreases when there are spots, meaning that the ratio n1/n2 is lower when the star is cooler. So, when the star cools down, the ratio goes down. We need to find the ratio of the ratios: (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

Wait, no. The question states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2)_spotted is less than (n1/n2)_unspotted. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted, which would be a number greater than 1.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å. Oh, wait, that's in the ultraviolet range, perhaps. But how does that tie in? Maybe it's about the ionization or excitation of the Ti
