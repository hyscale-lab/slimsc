Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with radius equal to the Sun. So Rstar = R_sun, I guess. Then, one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Hmm, filling factor I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% coverage on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temp difference of 1000K. So spots are at 5000K?

Wait, no, wait. The temp difference is 1000K, but it's the spots' temp. So the star's Teff is 6000K, so spots are 6000-1000=5000K. I think that's correct.

The situation is that when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing changes in brightness. This can mimic the presence of an exoplanet when looking at photometric data. But the question is, if the star wasn't spotted, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation, i.e., same amplitude in the light curve.

So, the problem is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit would cause the same dip in brightness as the star's spots do.

Wait, but the star's brightness variation due to spots is different from a planet's transit. Let me think about each effect.

When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some
