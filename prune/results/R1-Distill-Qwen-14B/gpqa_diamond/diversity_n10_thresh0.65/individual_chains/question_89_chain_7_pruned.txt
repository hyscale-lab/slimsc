Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, it goes through several steps, each producing a new product. The final part asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, based on its 1H NMR spectrum.

Let me break down each step.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But wait, in this case, the starting material isn't a vicinal dihalide. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure, which is a diamondoid hydrocarbon. So the structure is a bit more complex.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so the structure is a four-bridge bicyclo structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on opposite ends of the adamantane. When KOH is added, maybe it's a double elimination. Oh wait, but each Br is on a bridgehead. Wait, no, adamantane's structure has each bridgehead as a tertiary carbon. So each Br is on a
