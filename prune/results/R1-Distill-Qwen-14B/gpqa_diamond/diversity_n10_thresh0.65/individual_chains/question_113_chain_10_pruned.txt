Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The task is to figure out which one matches the given spectral data.

Alright, let's break down the data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak. Also, the two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmmm. So 1700 is a strong peak, which usually suggests a carbonyl group. Like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. Wait, maybe that's an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl? Or maybe an ester or amide? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like a ketone with some conjugation. 

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum. They mentioned several peaks, including ones for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. So maybe an alkene group is present.

Now the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion (like an acetyl group), or maybe a (CH2)3O+ or something else. Wait, wait, another possibility: the molecular ion might break into smaller ions. The molecular formula for the options has O, so maybe the fragment comes from losing something. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. If a fragment is at 45, that's about a third of that.
