Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that in relativity, when dealing with high speeds close to the speed of light, we use the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is equal to 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed here is 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation.

Let me compute gamma. So v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared, which is 0.9216 c². Subtract that from c², so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Take the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me check that. 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1, right? 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, and 0.28 * 0.0714 is about 0.02, so together that's 1. So gamma is 3.5714 approximately.

Wait, but wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Now, the problem is about the energy of the nucleus. The energy in a particle accelerator is usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. But wait, sometimes people refer to the total energy, which includes the rest mass. I'm a bit confused about that. Let me think. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, which is mc². So E = gamma * m c². But the kinetic energy K is E minus mc², which would be (gamma - 1) * mc². So what is the question asking for? The energy of the collider. I think it's usually referring to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, the options are in GeV,
