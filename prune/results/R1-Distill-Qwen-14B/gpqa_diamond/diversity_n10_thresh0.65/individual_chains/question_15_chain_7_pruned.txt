Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they want to observe the one more likely to transit. Both were found via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. The stars are interesting too: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. 

Hmm, so they want to pick the planet with the higher transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But since both planets are Earth-like, maybe the planet size is similar? Or wait, the question says both have the same masses, but mass doesn't directly translate to radius. But in the context of transit probability, it's the planet's radius relative to the star's radius that matters, right?

Wait, no. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a_s / a_p), but wait, no, I think I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the density of the sky in the right direction, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact formula. Maybe it's more like the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a) * (something else), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability, P, is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2))^(3/2), but since the orbits are circular, e=0. So that term is 1. So it simplifies to P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * something else.

Wait no, I think I was wrong. Another approach: The probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the size of the star to the distance between the observer and the star, but that doesn't make sense
