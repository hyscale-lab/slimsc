Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity. Right, because at those speeds, things like length contraction and time dilation come into play.

The question is about finding the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a different relative speed and energy.

Wait, so the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, all in the positive x-direction. I think the first part is about finding the relative velocity between them, and the second part is about calculating the total energy.

Let me break it down. For the relative speed, I remember that you can't just subtract their speeds in classical terms, because that would give something like 0.1c, but in relativity, you have to use the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, in which direction? Since both are moving in the same direction, one is moving faster than the other.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from B's perspective, what's A's speed? Or is it the other way around? Wait no, the question asks for the relative speed. So that would be the speed of one as seen from the other. Let me clarify: if A is moving at u = 0.6c and B is moving at v =0.5c, then from B's frame, A's speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Which is about 0.14c. So that would be the relative speed.

Wait, but wait. If both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is not just the difference because of the relativistic addition. So, 0.6 and 0.5, so the relative speed would be calculated as I did, giving approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. But wait, wait. No, because energy is frame-dependent. Oh wait, but the question says "the total energy of the system." Oh, does it mean in the rest frame where the system's center of momentum is at rest? Or is it the sum of their energies in the lab frame?

Wait, let me think. The problem states that the astronauts are moving at those speeds in the positive x-direction. So perhaps we are to calculate the total energy in that same frame. But wait, the problem doesn't specify which frame, but "the system" would imply the total energy in the same frame as the velocities given.

So each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is
