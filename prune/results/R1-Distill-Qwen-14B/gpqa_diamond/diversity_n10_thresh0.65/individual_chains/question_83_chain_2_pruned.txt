Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details about titration and pH calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrating that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, with different pairs of pH values.

First, let me recap what I know. Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH, which dissociates in water slightly. When you titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, it neutralizes the acid, producing the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The problem involves two parts: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence. Each requires a different approach.

Let me break it down.

First, let me figure out the initial concentrations after dilution.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting that with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 liters).

The initial moles of acetic acid are volume × concentration. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles. Right. After dilution to 40 cm³, the concentration is moles/volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach equivalence is important. But for the 25% titration point, I think that refers to the volume of NaOH used being 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate the equivalence volume first. Because that will help me figure out what 25% of that is.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid present. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles.

Moles of NaOH = moles of CH3COOH = 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

So 25% titration means 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, for each case (25% and equivalence), I need to calculate the pH.

Starting with the 25% titration point.

At 25% tit
