Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it again and break it down step by step. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here. The question is about luminosity, which relates to temperature and radius, right? So maybe the mass isn't directly relevant. Well, I'll keep that in mind.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. So according to Wien's Law, lambda_max is proportional to 1/(T+something), but I think Wien's displacement law says lambda_max * T = constant, about 2.898×10^-3 m·K. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same too. Because if lambda is the same, then T would be the same. So both stars have the same temperature. That's a key point.

The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But I'm not sure how that affects the luminosity calculation. Oh, wait, the luminosity we observe would depend on the Doppler shift due to their velocities. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelengths get shifted. But wait, in the problem, the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So maybe the Doppler effect has already been accounted for in the observed wavelengths. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same for both. But the actual emitted lambda_max (before any Doppler shift) would depend on their temperatures. But wait, if they have the same observed lambda_max, does that mean their temperatures are the same, or does the Doppler shift change that?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength is lambda = lambda_0 * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Or is it (1 - v_r/c) if moving towards us? Wait, I think it's lambda_observed = lambda_source * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive if moving away (redshifted) and negative if moving towards (blueshifted). 

So, in the problem, both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So their lambda_observed is the same. But their actual lambda_emitted depends on their temperatures. So, let me write equations for each star.

For Star_1: v_r is 0, so lambda_1_observed = lambda_1_source. 

For Star_2: v_r is 700 km/s. So lambda_2_observed = lambda_2_source * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But the observed lambdas are the same, so lambda_1_observed = lambda_2_observed.

So, lambda_1_source = lambda_2_source * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But from Wien's Law, lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So lambda_1_source = b / T1 and lambda_2_source = b / T2, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So
