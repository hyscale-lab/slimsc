Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power, right? So mathematically, that's N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), but wait, isn't it more precise to say plx = 1 / (d * some constant)? Or maybe I should just think in terms of plx being proportional to 1/d. So if plx increases, distance decreases, and vice versa.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance (d), let's write that as plx = k/d, where k is a constant. Substituting that into the equation for N, we get N ∝ 1/( (k/d) )^5. Let's see, (k/d)^5 is k^5 divided by d^5, so 1 divided by that would be d^5 over k^5. But since k is a constant, the proportionality simplifies to N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question isn't directly asking about N in terms of distance; it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking about the differential number of stars, like the number of stars per unit distance (r), so dN/dr?

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N = C / plx^5, where C is some constant. Since plx is 1/d, substituting, N = C * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how N changes with distance. So if N increases with d^5, then the rate at which N increases would be the derivative dN/dr. Let me compute that. So N = C d^5. Taking the derivative with respect to r (which is d), dN/dr = 5 C d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like the density) increases with
