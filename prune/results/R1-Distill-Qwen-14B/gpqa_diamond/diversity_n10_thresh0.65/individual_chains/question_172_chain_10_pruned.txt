Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two stars, star_1 and star_2. Let me read it again.

So, the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Right, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles across energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor relates the population of two energy levels. The formula is N_upper/N_lower = exp( -(E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So, I think that would mean the population ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. Let me clarify: the energy level in star_1's photosphere is twice as excited. Does that mean the number of atoms in that excited state is higher?

Wait, the question states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, maybe the population in the higher energy level is higher. Let's think: the ratio N_upper/N_lower is proportional to exp(-Î”E/(kT)). So, if star_1 has a higher ratio (more excited), then for star_1, N_upper/N_lower is higher than for star_2.

But wait, the given excitation is twice as excited. So, if star_1's ratio is twice star_2's ratio. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm, maybe that means the excitation potential is higher, but I'm not sure how to interpret that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of excited atoms is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So, the ratio N_1 (for star_1) / N_2 (for star_2) equals 2. So, N_1/N_2 = 2.

Wait, wait. No, let me get this right. The question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So, perhaps the ratio
