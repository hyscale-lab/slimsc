Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that seems like a 2-dimensional metric because there are only dx and dy terms. Oh, right, this is a 2-dimensional spacetime or some surface embedded in higher dimensions. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is usually a 2-dimensional surface in 3D space. But wait, in relativity, a pseudosphere could refer to a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space, right? Or maybe it's referring to something else.

Wait, the question is asking about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, I think that in 2D, the pseudosphere is the hyperbolic plane. But wait, the metric given might be representing a hyperbolic space. Let me think about hyperbolic metrics.

In hyperbolic geometry, the metric is usually written as ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ² or something similar, but that's in polar coordinates. Alternatively, another common form is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²)/(a²)) or similar, but I might be mixing it up. Oh wait, no, sometimes it's expressed in terms of a function of r. But the given metric is in terms of x and y, not polar coordinates.

Wait, another thought. The metric given here is conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). So it's conformally equivalent to the flat Euclidean metric. The conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Hmm, so the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which suggests that the domain of x and y is such that 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² <4. So the domain is the interior of a circle with radius 2, because when x² + y² =4, the denominator becomes zero, which would be a problem. So the space is the disk of radius 2 in 2D.

Wait, but if it's a pseudosphere, then perhaps it's a surface with constant negative curvature, which in 2D would be a hyperbolic plane. But the hyperbolic plane isn't compact, right? Because as you go to infinity, the area increases. So if the radius is 2, but the space is a disk, perhaps it's a model of the hyperbolic plane with a certain curvature.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere (if it's a sphere in hyperbolic space) would depend on the radius. But wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere of radius r is 4π a² sinh²(r/a), but I might be mixing the formulas. Or wait, no, the area of a sphere in hyperbolic space might be 4π a² (cosh(r/a) - 1), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, in 2D hyperbolic geometry, the "circle" with radius r has circumference 2π a sinh(r/a), and area π a² (cosh(2r/a) -1 ). Hmm, but I'm not confident about these formulas, I think I should look for another approach.

But perhaps instead, I should compute the area using the given metric. Since it's a 2D metric, the area can be found by integrating the area element over the space. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, but this metric is diagonal and conformally flat, so g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), so the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy = same, g_xy = 0. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 * (1)(1) - 0, so sqrt(|g|) is (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2)).

So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Hmm, but that would make the area integral ∫∫ (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy over the region where x² + y² <4. Wait, but that integral would have a denominator approaching zero as x² + y² approaches 4, making it diverge. So the area would be infinite, I think.

Wait, but the options include D) +infty. So perhaps the area is infinite, which would mean option D is the answer. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but in this case, the metric is defined only in the disk of radius 2. So perhaps this is a pseudosphere of radius 2, and the area is infinite because the space is infinitely curved or the volume doesn't converge.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what a pseudosphere is. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given here might be representing a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D.

So looking at the options:

A) 0: Not possible, area can't be zero.

B)4π(x² + y²): But the area should be a constant, not dependent on x and y.

C)4π(x² - y²): Same issue as B.

D) +infty: That makes sense because the space is a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.

So the answer should be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformally flat and defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) ensures the metric is well-defined within the disk of radius 2. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\).

To compute the area, the area element in 2D is given by \(\sqrt{|g|} \, dx \, dy\), where \(|g|\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is \(\left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\), so the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The area is then obtained by integrating this area element over the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). However, as \(x^2 + y^2\) approaches 4, the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) approaches zero, causing the integral to diverge. This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area cannot be zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area should not depend on \(x\) and \(y\).
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect for the same reason as B.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges, and the pseudosphere has infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
