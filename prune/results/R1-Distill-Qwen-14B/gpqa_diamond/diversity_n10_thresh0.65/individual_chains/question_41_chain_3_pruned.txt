Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. The question is asking for the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember from my classes that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, but when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Oh right! Einstein's theory of relativity comes into play here. So in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But in a medium, like glass, it's different.

The speed of light in a medium is usually c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, if the medium is moving, does that change things? Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed would be affected by the glass's velocity, right?

Wait, no, I think it's more complicated than that. Because the refractive index itself is a property of the medium, so the speed of light inside the glass depends on n. But the movement of the glass might involve some relativistic effects.

Wait, but the scenario is non-relativistic because it says the speed is constant and in the same direction. Oh, but the options don't look like they're using a gamma factor or anything, which suggests maybe it's not relativistic addition. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the Doppler effect. No, the Doppler effect changes the frequency or wavelength, not the speed of light in the medium. Or maybe, since the glass is moving towards the observer, the observed speed is different.

Wait, let me think again. The speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n, which is a constant in the glass's frame. But when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, how does that affect the observed speed?

In the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light comes out of the glass (assuming the light is moving from the glass to the observer) and is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be the speed in the glass plus the glass's velocity? Or is it more complicated than that.

Wait, but the light's speed in the glass is c/n, and the glass is moving at v. So in the lab frame, the speed would be (c/n) + v. But wait, that would only be the case in Galilean
