Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what it's asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P seems to be a vector operator, so I think it's the Pauli matrices or something similar, but scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the problem gives the components of P. Let me jot down what I remember about Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by ħ/2 for spin-1/2 systems.

In the problem, the X-component Px is given as (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix. The matrix has first row (0,1), second row (1,0). That's the Pauli X matrix, σ_x. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,-i) and second row (i,0), which is σ_y. Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σ_z.

So the operator P is the vector formed by these components. But wait, when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction n, the operator is usually the dot product of the Pauli vector and the direction vector. So P = n · (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2.

But wait, in this problem, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So that direction would have components (n_x, 0, n_z) because it's in the x-z plane. So the operator along n would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z, right? Because the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, the general form is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So if n is (n_x, 0, n_z), then P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but let me think again. The operator P is the spin component along the direction n. So for a spin-1/2 system, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli vector · n. So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

So the problem says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we need
