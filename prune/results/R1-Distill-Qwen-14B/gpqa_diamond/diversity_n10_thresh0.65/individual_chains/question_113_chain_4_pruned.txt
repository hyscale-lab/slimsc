Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. I've got an unknown compound, and I need to determine its formula from the given spectroscopic data. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

So, starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate hydrogen bonding, which is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, there's also a peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 could be a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching or another carbonyl group in conjugation, like in an acid.

Looking at the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means there's a double bond, so maybe an alkene or something like that. The presence of both a carbonyl and a double bond could point towards something like an ester with a double bond, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Now the mass spec part. The fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let me think. 45 could be (CH3)2O, but that's 45 (since 2*12 +6=30, plus O is 16, total 46? Wait, maybe not. Or maybe it's CH2O (formaldehyde?) but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe a fragment with C3H7O? Wait, 3 carbons would be 3*12=36 plus 7 hydrogens (7) plus O (16) equals 36+7=43 +16=59? No, not matching.

Wait, another approach. Let's calculate the possible molecular formulas and see which one fits the mass spec.

Let's list the options:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight would be 6*12 +12 + 2*16 = 72 +12 +32 = 116.

B) C6H10O: 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 6*12 +10 +32=72+10=82 +32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100.

So, the molecular ion would be at 116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), or 100 (D). But the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. Maybe this is a fragment. Let's think what could fragment to 45.

Option A: molecular weight 116. If it breaks into a fragment of 45, what's left would be 71. Hmm, but 45 could be something else. Let's see, 45 is possible for (CH3)COO-? No, that's 59. Or perhaps a CH2CH2O group would be 44, but 45 could be that plus a hydrogen? Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O with a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula could have a functional group that would break off. For example, if the compound is an ester, then in mass spec, it might lose the R-O group. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, looking at the possible molecular formulas:

Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, like methyl something. For example, methyl cyclopentene something. Wait, but if it's an ester, the molecular formula would be R-O-CO-R'. Let's say, for example, methyl cyclohexane carboxylate. But the ester would have a carbonyl and an ether oxygen. The FTIR shows both 1700 and 1650, which might suggest conjugation. Alternatively, a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that's less likely with a vinyl group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. If a fragment at 45 is present, perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 and 69 (114-45=69). But what fragments could give m/z=45?

Wait, 45 could be a (CH3)2CO+ ion. Let's see: (CH3)2CO is 58? Or wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is (3*12) +6 +16 = 36 +6 +16=58. So that's 58. Hmm, not matching 45
