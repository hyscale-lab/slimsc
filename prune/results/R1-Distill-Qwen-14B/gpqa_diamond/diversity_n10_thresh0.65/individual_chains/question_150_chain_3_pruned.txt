Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here because there's no halogen. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So plugging in: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and/or double bonds. Maybe an aromatic ring (which is three double bonds, so that's 3) plus a double bond (1) and perhaps an additional ring or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe an aldehyde group is present.

6.98 (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Probably part of an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted because two protons could be adjacent in a para setup. Wait, no, in para substitution, each H would have two neighbors. Or perhaps it's part of a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted aromatic ring.

6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. Maybe part of a benzene ring with substituents.

6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like -OH protons, but wait, the integration is 2. Alternatively, it could be protons adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol structure or something.

3.66 (d, 2H): Doublet, 2H. The chemical shift is around 3.66, which is probably CH2 near an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group, or something like that.

Putting this together, let me try to sketch a possible structure. The triplet at 9.72 suggests an aldehyde (RCHO), so that's
