Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings in a chair-like structure. 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure, but wait, I'm not sure of the exact positions. But for the reaction with KOH, it's an elimination reaction, probably.

Heating dibromide with KOH: that's a classic E2 elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, or maybe another position. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of an alkene, perhaps a diene or a more substituted one. Alternatively, could it form a diol? No, because KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in this context. So elimination is more likely.

Wait, wait, but with two adjacent bromines, maybe the elimination forms a diene? Let's think: if you have two Brs on adjacent carbons (like 1 and 2?), when KOH removes H from each, the double bond forms between 1 and 2, making a di-substituted alkene. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so maybe the elimination isn't straightforward. Or perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, leading to a double bond.

Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: perhaps the Brs are in positions that are opposite each other in the adamantane structure. So elimination would form a bridge or a more complex double bond arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene. Wait, but
