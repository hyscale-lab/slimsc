Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state of a qubit. Because each of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ has equal probability, right?

So, density matrices are 2x2 matrices for a qubit. The general form for a density matrix is ρ = [ [a, b], [c, d] ], where a, b, c, d are elements that must satisfy certain conditions like trace equal to 1, positive semi-definite, etc.

But wait, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Oh, I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's a vector on the unit sphere. For a mixed state, like this density matrix, I think it's represented as a vector inside the Bloch sphere.

In the Bloch representation, a density matrix ρ can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. So the vector r would correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

Let me break that down. The general form is ρ = (I + x X + y Y + z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. So, the vector r would be (x, y, z).

Looking at the given ρ: (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, because I is [[1,0],[0,1]].

Wait, so ρ = I/2. Now, let's see what that implies for the vector r in the Bloch sphere. Putting ρ into the form I/2, that would mean (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. So, (I + r·σ) = I, which implies r·σ = 0.

Hmm, because r·σ is a matrix where each component (x, y, z) is multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices. So r·σ = x X + y Y + z Z. For this to be zero, each component must be zero. So x=0, y=0, z=0.

So the vector r is (0,0,0). Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0).

Wait, does that make sense? A mixed state with equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩ would be at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because a pure state is on the surface, and as the state becomes completely mixed (maxim
