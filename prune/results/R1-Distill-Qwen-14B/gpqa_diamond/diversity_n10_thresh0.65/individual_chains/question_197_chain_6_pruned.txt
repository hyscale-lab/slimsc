Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound X based on the IR and NMR data provided. Then, I have to determine what the product is after it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let me take this step by step.

First, looking at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone, but the 1720 is a bit higher than a typical ketone.

Wait, also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring. So putting that together, perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols are usually around 1-5, but a broad peak near 10 is typical for a carboxylic acid. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding
