Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reactions, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question describes three different Michael addition reactions and asks for the reactants and major products, which are labeled A, B, and C. Then, based on the options, I need to choose the correct set.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (the Michael donor) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor), leading to a new carbon-carbon bond. The product usually has a new conjugated system.

So the first reaction is:
Reactant 1: dimethyl malonate
Reactant 2: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate
Reagents: NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol)
Produces product A.

Hmm. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a strong nucleophile. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. It's a symmetric compound with two ester groups on either side of the central CH2.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let's draw its structure. Acrylate has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. The substituents on the double bond are a p-tolyl group (a methyl attached to a benzene) on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. And because it's E, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. Wait, wait, actually, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(OOCR)Râ€™ where R is the p-tolyl. Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, the substituents are CH2 (from CH2=CH-) and the C-p-tolyl-CO2Me group? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Perhaps it's the acrylate group is O=C-OCH3 at the end. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl) substituted. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, the name is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituent is on the third carbon. Oh, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent on the 3rd carbon would be on the CH2 part? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it more accurately.

The correct structure might be CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 but wait, that doesn't make sense for acrylate. Wait, acrylate is H2C=CHCOO-. So if the substituent is on the 3rd carbon, that's the third carbon from the ester. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that can't be right because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between C1 and C2. C3 is the next carbon, which would be attached to the p-tolyl group. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-
