Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, which means they have a higher chance of blocking their star's light from our point of view. They have limited time, so they need to choose the planet with the better odds.

Both planets have the same minimum masses, as they were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. I remember that the orbital period is related to the star's mass and the planet's distance. Oh right, Kepler's third law. But how does that tie into the transit probability?

Also, both planets have circular orbits. That might simplify things because eccentricity can complicate the transit chances, but since both are circular, maybe that's not a factor here.

The host stars' masses are different. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one hosting Planet_2. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but in this case, they evolved such that their radii are the same. Maybe Planet_2's star is a bit older or more evolved, so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, but same size as the other.

So, what factors affect the probability of a transit? I recall that the probability depends on the relative sizes of the planet and its star, and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The probability is higher if the star is larger (because the planet can block more light) and if the planet's orbital plane is closer to our line of sight. Oh wait, no, actually, the transit probability formula is P = (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination angle. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The formula I remember is P â‰ˆ (R_p / R_s) * ( (a_p) / (sqrt(a_p^2 - R_s^2)) ) ), but
