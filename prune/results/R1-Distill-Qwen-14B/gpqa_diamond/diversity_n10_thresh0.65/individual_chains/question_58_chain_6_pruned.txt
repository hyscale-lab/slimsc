Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies? The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these topics, but I'll try to think it through. So, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are like those infinities that pop up in calculations, which don't make physical sense, so you need to regularize them to make the math work.

Wait, but some theories are supposed to be "renormalizable," which means that even though they have these divergences, you can handle them using renormalization. But regularization is a step before renormalization, a way to make the infinities manageable so you can subtract or absorb them into counterterms.

Now, the question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So, which of these theories don't have these divergences, meaning they don't need regularization? Or maybe they handle it in a different way, so regularization isn't needed?

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, and it's supposed to be a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. Because it's a theory that includes gravity, and because it's a background-independent theory (I think), it might have different behavior at high energies. Oh wait, in string theory, at high
