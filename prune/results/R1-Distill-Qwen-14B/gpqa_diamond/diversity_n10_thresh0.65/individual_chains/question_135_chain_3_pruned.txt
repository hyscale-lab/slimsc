Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that looks a bit confusing. Let me parse it. The structure seems to be something like an interaction term where the boson X is coupling to fermions. The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian might be a Yukawa coupling type. Normally, the Yukawa interaction term is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where X is a scalar field. In this case, it's written as -λ f ψ_f (something), so maybe ψ_f is a fermion field, and (υ + X) is acting like the mass term. Oh wait, typically, the mass comes from the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a scalar field. If υ is the VEV, then ψ_f is a fermion that gets a mass m = λ υ. And X is the fluctuation around that VEV. So the interaction term would be L = -λ ψ_f X ψ_f, which is a Yukawa coupling.

So the coupling is between X and the fermion ψ_f. So when X decays, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the energy is sufficient.

Now, the question is about the allowed decay modes of X. The boson's mass is 6 GeV, so the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be allowed, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. This is the basic condition for decay kinematics.

So, looking at the options, each option lists possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. Let's think about each fermion and their masses.

First, I need to know the masses of the fermions that ψ_f can be. Since the Lagrangian has ψ_f, λ, and the mass term comes from υ, the fermion's mass would be m_f = λ υ. Oh, but wait, the problem says that the interaction is given by that term, but perhaps the fermions involved are those that are part of the Standard Model? Because the options include various quarks and leptons.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", so perhaps the fermions ψ_f are the ones that X can decay into. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to, provided the energy is sufficient.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, the interaction is written as λ f ψ_f (something). Hmm, maybe I should pay attention to the factors. Let me write
