Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should understand what each spectrograph can observe. From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag are observed. Oh, but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So a magnitude of 17 is fainter than, say, 16. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than (brighter than) 17, ESPRESSO can see it.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star with apparent magnitude less than 16 is okay for HIRES.

So the goal is to find stars that are bright enough (apparent V mag ≤ 17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES). But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both. So the apparent magnitude of the star must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and also ≤16 (for HIRES), because to be observed by both, it must be within the brighter limit of both. Wait, wait. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So the star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 17 (say 18 mag), ESPRESSO can't see it. Wait no, the observable stars are those with V mag less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, its V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. A star is observable by ESPRESSO if V ≤17. It's observable by HIRES if V ≤16. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V ≤16, because if V is 16.5, it's within ESPRESSO's range (since 16.5 ≤17), but not for HIRES (16.5 >16
