Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta position, forming an enolate intermediate.

Let me look at the question again. There are three separate reactions, A, B, and C, and I need to find out the reactants and major products for each. The options give different possibilities, so I'll have to analyze each part.

First, reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I think NaOEt is a base, maybe acting as a catalyst or deprotonating something. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. It has two ester groups, so it can form an enolate easily.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-C(O)OEt with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is at the beginning, with the substituent on the gamma position.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (like the enolate from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate would add to the acrylate's beta carbon. Let me draw this.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO-)2CH-; when deprotonated, it forms an enolate with the negative charge on the central carbon. So when it attacks the acrylate, the enolate's carbon would add to the acrylate's beta carbon, which is the CH2 in CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) group.

Wait, wait. The acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent (p-tolyl) on the third carbon. Wait no, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, the formula for methyl (E)-
