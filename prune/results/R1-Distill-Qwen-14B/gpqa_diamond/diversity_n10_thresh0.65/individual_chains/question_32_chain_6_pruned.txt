Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, what's that mean? Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. But if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus we're dealing with is Li-6. I think I need to calculate the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which I believe relates to the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy maybe? Or is it just the total energy? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think.

Wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the total energy of the particles being accelerated. The total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So the formula for total energy (E) is gamma times the rest mass energy (mc²). So E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, sometimes colliders are described by their kinetic energy, but I think in this context, it's the total energy. Hmm, but maybe I should check that. The problem
