Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these questions can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Okay, the question is about a star and some dark spots on it. The setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, it's showing these spots in a way that causes brightness variations over time, which they observe via photometry. The interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. So the question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted star, assuming no spots were present?

Hmm, so the key here is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet's radius and Rstar is the host star's radius. Since the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, we can treat Rstar as R_sun, which is convenient.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip in light curve) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

Î”F = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the square of their radii ratio. So, if the planet's radius is Rpl and the star's is Rstar, the area blocked is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 multiplied by the star's total light.

But wait, in this problem, the star has dark spots. So the observed brightness variation isn't just from the planet blocking light, but from the spots rotating in and out of view. The approach should probably be to compute the equivalent dip caused by the spots and then compare it to the dip caused by a planet.

Let me think about the spotted star first.

The star's effective temperature is Teff = 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. Oh, so the filling factor is 0.2 in that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots on one hemisphere is 20%. But since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area covered by spots on the entire star would be 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface area.

Wait, is that correct? Let me clarify. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. Since only one hemisphere is spotty,
