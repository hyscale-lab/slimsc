Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite differences and parallel splitting. Hmm, the question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one using matrix exponential approximations. Let me think.

The question says that the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. So, in solving these heat equations, they're using some kind of method that involves matrix exponentials. I remember that matrix exponentials often come up in solutions involving systems of differential equations, especially when dealing with time-dependent PDEs like the heat equation. 

In a sequential algorithm, you process things step by step, perhaps using a time-stepping method. But when you want to make it parallel, you need to split the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously. So, how does that relate to matrix exponentials and fractional approximations?

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis. That sounds more about whether the numerical method is stable, not about parallelism. Stability is important but probably not the key factor for making it parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal BCs can complicate things, but I'm not sure how that ties into parallel splitting. Maybe if the boundaries are nonlocal, it affects how the matrix is structured, but I don't see the direct link to parallelism.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximations can involve complex numbers. If the roots are complex, maybe that affects how the matrix can be diagonalized or decomposed for parallel processing. Because complex roots often come in conjugate pairs, perhaps that allows for certain types of matrix splitting, which could be useful in parallel algorithms.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are a way to break down complex functions into simpler parts. If the approximation can be expressed as a linear combination of simpler functions, maybe each term can be handled in parallel. For example, if the matrix can be written as a sum of matrices that are easy to exponentiate, each part could be computed separately and then combined. That seems plausible.

Wait, thinking more about matrix exponentials and parallelism. Matrix exponentials can be computationally intensive, especially for large matrices. To compute the exponential in parallel, the matrix needs to be decomposed into parts that can be handled simultaneously. Diagonalization is a common approach because if a matrix is diagonal, its exponential is easy. But not all matrices are diagonalizable. Alternatively, partial fraction decomposition might allow the exponential to be expressed as a sum of exponentials of smaller matrices, which can be computed in parallel.

Fractional approximation methods, like those used in exponential splitting, involve approximating the exponential function with a rational function. The structure of this approximation can affect how the algorithm can be parallelized. If the approximation's denominator factors into linear terms (maybe complex), the matrix can be decomposed accordingly.

Wait, option C mentions complex roots. If the approximation leads to a denominator with complex roots, the matrix might be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric parts or something like that. Or perhaps it allows for splitting into smaller matrices that can be exponentiated independently in parallel.

Option D says linear partial fraction. Partial fractions are about breaking a rational function into a sum of simpler fractions. If the approximation can be split into linear terms, each term's exponential might be computed separately. For example, if the approximation is a sum of terms like (λ_i I + A), each λ could be handled in a separate thread or processor. That would allow for
