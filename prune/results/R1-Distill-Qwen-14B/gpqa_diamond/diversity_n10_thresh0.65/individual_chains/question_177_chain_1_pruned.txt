Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities. Hmm, I remember that luminosity depends on both the radius and the temperature of the star. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures should be the same too. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2? Or does the velocity affect this?

Oh, wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But how does that affect their brightness and temperature? Hmm, radial velocity could cause a Doppler shift, right? So the observed wavelength might be different from the rest wavelength. But in this case, the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so maybe the Doppler shifts adjust for that.

Wait, but the question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same. So for each star, the observed λ is the same. So for each star, their temperature as observed would be T = b / λ_obs. But wait, the star's actual temperature is affected by their own motion. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelengths are shifted.

Let me think: the Doppler effect for light. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if moving towards, shorter (blueshifted). Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is pretty high. But Star_1's is zero. So Star_2's light is either redshifted or blueshifted.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths (the ones the astronomers measure) are the same for both. So if Star_2 is moving, but the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's, then the Doppler shift must have corrected for the actual
