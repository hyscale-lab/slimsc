Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators. Oh right, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. Each component of the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times these matrices. So the operator here, P, is probably similar to the spin operator.

The question gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the σx matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2)* [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is like σy times ħ/2. And Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σz times ħ/2.

So the operator P is a vector operator, and it's given along some direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n could be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that, since it's in the x-z plane, y-component is zero.

But the eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator P·n, which would be the dot product of P and the direction vector n. Oh right, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction component.

Wait, so P·n would be Px * nx + Py * ny + Pz * nz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P·n = Px * nx + Pz * nz. And since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

But the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of P·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Maybe I should first express the operator P·n in terms of the Pauli matrices or the given components. Since each component is given, I can write the operator as a matrix.

Let me think. The direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz),
