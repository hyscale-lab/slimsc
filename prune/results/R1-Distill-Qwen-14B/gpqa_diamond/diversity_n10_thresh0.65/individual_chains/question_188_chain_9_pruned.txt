Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral is a type of crystal structure, right? It's also called the trigonal crystal system because all the edges are the same, and the angles between them are equal. Oh wait, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. I'm a bit confused about what that exactly refers to. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which means all edges are equal, so a = b = c. So each edge length (a, b, c) is the same, which in this case must be 10 Angstrom because the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a simple cubic structure would be the edge length. But wait, rhombohedral isn't simple cubic because the angles are different, but in this case, they are 30 degrees each.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms. In a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedron. So the edge length 'a' is the distance between adjacent atoms along the edges. So a would be 10 Angstrom.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Because in some structures, like hexagonal close-packed, the nearest neighbor distance is along a different direction. But in a simple cubic structure, the edge length is the same as the nearest neighbor distance. So in this case, if it's a simple rhombohedral structure, a would be 10 Angstrom. But wait, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice, right?

So the problem is about interplanar distance. The (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_hkl is calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell parameters. The formula is something like d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... terms involving the angles ... )).

Wait, let me think. For a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, the formula is more complicated because the angles between the axes aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(
