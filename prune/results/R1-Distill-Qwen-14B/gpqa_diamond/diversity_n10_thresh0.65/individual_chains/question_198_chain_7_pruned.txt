Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it. The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Let's break it down.

Alright, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

Wait, but wait—the way the problem is phrased, it says "dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands, right? So the blue complexes are probably the ones with two SCN- ions. But wait, the complexes have varying numbers of SCN- attached. Let me think about the possible complexes.

Cobalt can form complexes with different numbers of SCN- ions. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, [Co(SCN)_4]^4- maybe? Or perhaps the charges are different. Oh, wait, the stability constants given are β1 to β4. I think βn represents the formation of the complex with n SCN- ligands. So for each n, βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) or something like that. Wait, let me think. The general formula for the nth complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+), because each SCN- is -1, and Co^2+.

Wait, no, Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n], the charge would be 2+ - n*(1-) = 2 - n. So that's the charge of the complex. But I'm not entirely sure, but maybe that's not crucial right now.

The key point is that each βn represents the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for the monomeric complex, β2 for the dimer, etc.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I'm assuming are the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex (since di would mean two ligands). So we're being asked what fraction of all the cobalt species is in the form of the dithiocyanato complex.

So, the first thing I think is that we need to calculate the distribution of Co among all possible complexes. Since the concentration of Co is given, and the concentration of SCN- is much higher (0.1 M vs 1e-2 M Co), we can probably assume that most of the Co is complexed, but let me proceed.

The approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. I remember that when dealing with multiple formation steps, it's often useful to consider the cumulative formation constants. Wait, no, the given β's are stepwise? Or are they the formation constants for each step? Hmm, I think βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the
