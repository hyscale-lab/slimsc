Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about what that means. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but when calculating relativistic energy, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. So, first I should find the rest mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the protons and neutrons because of binding energy, but maybe for this problem, I can approximate it using the atomic mass.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon. Wait, but a nucleus is made up of nucleons. If each nucleon has a rest mass of about 931 MeV/c² (since one atomic mass unit is approximately 931 MeV/c²), then Li-6 has 6 nucleons.

So the rest mass energy (m*c²) would be 6 * 931 MeV. Let me calculate that: 6 * 931 = 5586 MeV, which is 5.586 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The actual mass of Li-6 is slightly different because of the binding energy. Oh, right, the binding energy reduces the rest mass because energy is released when the nucleus forms. But if I don't have the
