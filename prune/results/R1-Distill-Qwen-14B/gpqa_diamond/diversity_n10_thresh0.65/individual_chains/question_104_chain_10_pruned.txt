Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, right? It's about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The question says that two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, have each been found to have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main point is about the Doppler shifts they observed.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right! The amplitude of the radial velocity (the shift in the spectral lines) depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Or wait, is it the other way around?

Let me think. The formula I recall is something like K = (V) = (G * (Mp) * sin i) / ( (Mstar + Mp)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(-1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 year) * (2π) )) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (Mstar + Mp) )) )... No, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (Mp sin i) ) / ( (Mstar + Mp)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) ? No, wait. Let me get the correct formula.

I think the correct formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (Mp sin i) ) / ( (Mstar + Mp)^(2/3) * ( (P/(2π))^2 )^(1/3) )) ) )^(1/1) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the relationship between K and the orbital period. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the star's velocity semi-amplitude. The formula I remember is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (Mp sin i) ) / ( (Mstar + Mp)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But I've probably got that wrong. Alternatively, I think the formula
