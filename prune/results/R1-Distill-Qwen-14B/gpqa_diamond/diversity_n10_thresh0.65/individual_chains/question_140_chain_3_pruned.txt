Okay, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, precipitate G, and some byproduct B. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

First, the reaction is violent and releases gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. Oh, wait, if the number of neutrons equals protons, then the molecule must be something like H2O or maybe NH3, but wait, no. Wait, let's see. For a molecule, the sum of protons and neutrons would be the same. Wait, no, the molecule's each atom has protons and neutrons. But wait, the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, perhaps it's a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons. Not sure yet.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is about 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, what substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water? Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0 C), so 277 is a bit higher. Or maybe another compound. Wait, another thought: maybe B is something like NH3, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe something else. Wait, perhaps B is an oxide or another compound.

Looking further, the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something similar. When they react with X, maybe it's a condensation reaction or something else. The product may involve formation of an ester or something. Wait, but how does X fit in here? Also, X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like HCl, H2SO4, perhaps metals like Li, Na, etc.

Wait, the initial reaction: X reacts with Y. Let's see, what liquids react violently with metals? Maybe liquid Y is water. If X is a metal, like sodium, potassium, etc., reacting with water would produce H2 gas. So gas W could be H2. Then, in that case, H2 has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so total protons are 2, and neutrons are 0. Oh wait, but that can't be because the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule would be 2 and 0, which are not equal. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe W is something else. Let me think. What gases have equal number of protons and neutrons in their molecule. Let's see, maybe CO2? No, but wait, CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in most cases) and 2 O (8 each). But the molecule as a whole would have 12 protons (from C) and 2*8 =16 neutrons. So 12 vs 16, not equal. Hmm.

Or perhaps a molecule like CH4. Each CH4 has 6 protons (from C) + 4 H (1 each) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each H
