Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to understand what it's asking. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Wait, the system is isolated, so energy considerations would involve electric potential energy. Since the charges are identical and all are 2e, they are all the same type of charge. But wait, actually, wait—wait, hold on. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So the setup is that we have 12 charges each 2 meters away from the central charge. But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves?

Oh right, because the problem says the system's energy, so I have to consider all the pairwise interactions. So the total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but wait—let me think. The potential energy in an electric system is usually calculated as the work done to bring each charge into place. So for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But I have to be careful about whether each pair is counted once or multiple times.

So, in this case, there are two types of interactions: those between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges at 2m,
