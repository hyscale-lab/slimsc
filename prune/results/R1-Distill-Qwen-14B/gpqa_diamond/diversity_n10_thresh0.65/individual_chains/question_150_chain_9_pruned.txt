Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. So, I'll calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That means probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond or ring (another 2?), or maybe a carbonyl group. Not too sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high upfield for an aromatic proton? Or wait, maybe an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's an aldehyde in a conjugated system?
- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. So perhaps aromatic protons next to substituents.
- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring.
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like OH protons? Or maybe vinyl protons in a conjugated system. But if it's a singlet, maybe it's a group like -CH2- with some symmetry?
- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. ACH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Maybe a methylene next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

So putting this together, maybe it's a structure with a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and some substituents. Alternatively, maybe a diphenyl compound with some conjugated double bonds and a carbonyl group.

Wait, the reaction steps: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH with heat. Hmm, that sequence sounds familiar. NaNO2 and HCl is usually for diazotization, which is used in reactions like Sandmeyer or perhaps for forming nitro compounds. Then water might be part of a hydrolysis, and KOH with heat sounds like a dehydration or elimination reaction.

Wait, but what's the initial compound? Let's think about the NMR again. The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm, and the triplet suggests it's coupled with two protons. So maybe the aldehyde is at the end of a conjugated system. The doublet at around 7 ppm and another at 6.51 as doublets might be part of a benzene ring. The 6.27 ppm as a singlet, 2Hâ€”could that be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen? Or maybe a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like two benzene rings connected by a chain with an aldehyde group and some substituents. Let me think. Another approach is to consider
