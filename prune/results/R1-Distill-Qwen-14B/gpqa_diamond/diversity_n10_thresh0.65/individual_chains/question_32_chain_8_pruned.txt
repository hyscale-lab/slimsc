Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's try to work through this.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So natural lithium has 3 protons, but if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, probably a deuteron? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Deuteron is H-2, right? So Li-6 would have 6 nucleons. So the mass of the nucleus is 6 times the mass of a proton? Or wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², but when you have multiple nucleons, the nucleus has a binding energy, so the mass is slightly less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons. But for heavy ions like this, I think the problem might just be using the rest mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Or perhaps the mass is approximated as 6 times the proton mass. I'm not sure, but maybe I can proceed without knowing the exact mass, because perhaps I'm supposed to calculate it.

Wait, but the problem is about relativistic energy. The energy of the collider would be the total energy of each nucleus, which is gamma times mc². So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which
