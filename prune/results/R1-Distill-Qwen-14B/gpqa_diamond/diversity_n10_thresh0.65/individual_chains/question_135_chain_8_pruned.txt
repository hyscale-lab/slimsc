Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to pay attention to that for the kinematics part.

Wait, the problem says it's the lowest order decays, so I think I'm looking at tree-level Feynman diagrams. The kinematic condition is that the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into. That's because you can't have a particle with mass less than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

So the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I need to figure out which fermion pairs it can decay into. Let me list out the possible fermions:

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t)
Leptons: electron (e), muon (mu), tau (tau), and their antiparticles.

Wait, but each quark comes with its antiquark, right? So pairs like uū, dđ, etc.

Now, what are the masses of these particles in GeV? I remember roughly:

- u quark: about 2-5 MeV, so negligible compared to GeV.
- d quark: around 3-7 MeV, also negligible.
- s quark: about 95-105 MeV.
- c quark: ~1.3 GeV.
- b quark: ~4.5 GeV.
- t quark: way heavier, like around 173 GeV.

Leptons:
- electron: ~0.511 MeV.
- muon: ~105.7 MeV.
- tau: ~1.78 GeV.
- So, tau is about 1.78 GeV.

So the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me think about each possible decay option.

Option A says X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quarks are
