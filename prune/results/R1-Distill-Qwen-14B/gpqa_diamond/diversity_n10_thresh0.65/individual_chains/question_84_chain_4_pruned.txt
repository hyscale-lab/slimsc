Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I remember that solving heat equations usually involves partial differential equations, and when the dimension is higher, the problem becomes more complex.

The question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. I think that has something to do with how the computations are structured. In sequential algorithms, you process each step one after another, but parallel processing allows multiple steps to be done at the same time. So for that, you probably need some way to split the problem into parts that can be handled simultaneously.

The question mentions matrix exponential functions being approximated by fractional approximations. Matrix exponentials are common in solving systems of linear differential equations, right? And when we approximate them, especially for parallel computation, the way we break down the matrix operations must matter.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis. Stability is crucial in numerical methods to ensure the solution doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. But how does that directly relate to making an algorithm parallel? Maybe it's a factor, but not the key for converting to parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions mean that the boundary depends on values inside the domain, which can complicate things. Not sure how this ties into parallelism. Maybe it relates to how data is handled across boundaries in parallel processing, but I'm not certain.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximations often involve polynomials or functions that can be decomposed. Complex roots might imply that the approximation can be broken down into simpler components, each handled by a different processor in parallel. That sounds plausible because if the roots are complex, you might split the problem into parts that don't interfere with each other, allowing parallel execution.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are a way to decompose complex expressions into simpler terms. If the fractional approximation can be split into linear parts, each part could be processed in parallel. This seems similar to option C, but maybe more about the decomposition method itself.

So, which is more about the key factor? The question says the key factor is converting to parallel. I think the idea is that if the approximation can be decomposed without dependencies, you can compute each part in parallel. 

Option D says linear partial fraction, which is a decomposition technique. If you can split the matrix into parts using partial fractions, each part can be computed independently, which would allow parallel processing. Alternatively, complex roots (option C) might allow for a different kind of decomposition.

Wait, fractional approximation could refer to using a function approximation, like using a rational function to approximate the matrix exponential. This rational function might have poles or roots in the complex plane. If the matrix can be split into components that correspond to these roots, each component could be handled in parallel because they don't interfere with each other.

Another thought: when you use a method like the matrix exponential, it's often computed using eigenvalues and eigenvectors. If the matrix can be diagonalized, each diagonal element (an eigenvalue) can be exponentiated independently, which would be inherently parallel. But this would require the matrix to be diagonalizable, and how does that tie into the options?

Wait, the question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. So, perhaps the key is the structure of the approximation method that allows it to be split into parts.

The options focus on factors related to the approximation method. Stability (A) is more about numerical accuracy. Nonlocal boundary conditions (B) might complicate the algorithm but not directly cause parallelism.

Between C and D: Fractional approximation methods, like using Pad√© approximants, can sometimes be written as a ratio of polynomials. The roots of these polynomials (either real or complex) determine the behavior of the approximation. If the approximation has complex roots, they come in conjugate pairs, and perhaps each pair can be handled in a way that allows parallel processing. Alternatively, the partial fraction decomposition (D) breaks the function into simpler fractions that can be evaluated in parallel.

Wait, partial fraction decomposition is a method to split a rational function into a sum of simpler fractions. Each term in the decomposition could be computed by a different processor, allowing parallel computation. So if the fractional approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that are independent, then each term can be handled in parallel.

So, the key factor would be
