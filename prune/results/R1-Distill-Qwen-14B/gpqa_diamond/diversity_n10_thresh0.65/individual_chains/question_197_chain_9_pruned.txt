Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product. The options are four different compounds. 

First, I think I should analyze the IR and NMR data provided to figure out what compound X is. Once I know what X is, I can predict the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: I see peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad range probably indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong and could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. There's also a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So compound X probably has an aromatic ring.

Now the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Or if it's a ketone, that's less likely. Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So maybe X has a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest two sets of protons, each with two H, which are probably ortho to substituents. So structure like para-substituted benzene. The integration adds up to 4H, which is consistent with two doublets each integrating to 2.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH group attached to something else. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a substituent.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group, maybe next to another CH or something.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet? Wait, no, description says d (doublet?), but integration is 3H. A doublet for 3H could be a CH3 next to a CH group. Like maybe a -CH(CH3) structure. Wait, but a doublet would mean two neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something that splits into a triplet or a doublet. Or perhaps it's a geminal coupling, but that's less likely.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet (since it's a t) with 3H. That's a typical terminal CH3, like at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe an ethyl group is attached somewhere.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring is substituted with a group that has a chain. The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid. So the substituent on the benzene is a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the IR had a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a carbonyl. But for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1
