Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how their brightness changes over time. The question is comparing this to an exoplanet transit. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, if a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots can come into and out of view, which also affects the brightness.

So the setup is that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, right? And one hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The star is being observed, and the brightness variations are periodic due to rotation. This situation can mimic an exoplanet transit, but the question is about what the radius of a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation.

The task is to find Rpl (planet radius) divided by Rstar (host star radius) so that the light curve amplitude is the same as what the spots are causing.

Wait, I think the key here is to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and then set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transit.

Let me think. When a planet transits a star, the change in brightness is (Rp / Rstar)^2 because the area blocked is proportional to the radius squared. So the relative drop in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But with the star spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side (like during transit), they contribute less light to the total. The brightness variation will be due to the difference between the spotted and unspotted areas.

The star's total luminosity when spots are visible would be L = L_unspotted + L_spots. But when the spots are on the far side, all the light comes from the unspotted areas.

Wait, but the way the problem is presented is that the star's brightness varies as it rotates, showing the spots. So when the spots are facing us, we see less light, causing a dip. The maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible.

But how is the total brightness affected? Let me consider the star's total brightness when spots are present and when they're not.

The star's total brightness without any spots is L0 = 4πR²σTeff^4. But wait, actually, for a star, the luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So if part of the star is cooler, the total luminosity would be lower when those cooler regions are facing us.

The filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. But wait, since it's one hemisphere, maybe the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Or wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So for a hemisphere, which is half the star's surface, the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, so 10% of the total star's surface is spotted.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the brightness variation. Let me think about the maximum dip in brightness when the spots are on the front hemisphere and when they're on the back.

The star's total brightness when spots are on the near side: L = (1 - f) * L0 + f * L_spot, where f is the filling factor. Wait, no, actually, the star's apparent brightness will be the sum of the unspotted regions and the spotted regions. So the unspotted part contributes (1 - f) * L0, and the spotted part contributes f * L_spot.

But L_spot is the luminosity per unit area of the spot. The spot's temperature is Teff - 1000K? Wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So spot temperature is 5000K.

So the luminosity per unit area (sigma T^4) for the spots is sigma*(5000)^4, and for the rest of the star it's sigma*(6000)^4.

So the total luminosity when the spots are on the near side is:

L_spotted = (1 - f) * sigma R^2 (6000)^4 + f * sigma R^2 (5000)^4.

The luminosity when the spots are on the far side is:

L_unspotted = (1) * sigma R^2 (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the far side, they don't contribute to the observed brightness. So when the spots are on the far side, the observed brightness is just the star's normal luminosity. But when the spots are on the near side, part of the star's surface (f fraction) is at a lower temperature, so the observed brightness decreases.

Wait, but the star's surface isn't all at the same temperature. So the total observed flux when the spots are on the near side is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The flux from the star when spots are visible is:

F_spotted = (1 - f) * (sigma T_eff^4) + f * (sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4 )

where deltaT is 1000K. So F_spotted = sigma [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - deltaT)^4 ].

The flux when spots are not visible (i.e., on the far side) is F_unspotted = sigma Teff^4.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star is rotating, with a hemisphere covered in spots. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible; when it's the other hemisphere, which is unspotted, we see the full star.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So one hemisphere (half the star's surface) has 20% spotted. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (pi R^2 / 2) ) = 0.1 pi R^2. The total area of the star is pi R^2, so the spot area is 10% of the total surface.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the average brightness.

The average brightness when spots are on the near side is (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - deltaT)^4. So the fractional change is [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - deltaT)^4 ] / Teff^4 - 1.

So the dip in brightness is 1 - [(1 - f) + f ( (Teff - deltaT)/Teff )^4 ].

Wait, let's compute that.

Let me compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are present.

Fractional change delta_F = (F_spotted - F_unspotted) / F_unspotted.

So F_unspotted = sigma R^2 Teff^4.

F_spotted = sigma R^2 [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - deltaT)^4 ]

So delta_F = [ ( (1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - deltaT)^4 ) - Teff^4 ] / Teff^4

Simplify numerator:

(1-f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - deltaT)^4 - Teff^4 = -f Teff^4 + f (Teff - deltaT)^4 = f [ (Teff - deltaT)^4 - Teff^4 ]

So delta_F = [ f ( (Teff - deltaT)^4 - Teff^4 ) ] / Teff^4.

Since (Teff - deltaT) < Teff, the difference will be negative, so delta_F is negative, meaning a decrease in flux.

So the fractional change is delta_F = f [ ( (Teff - deltaT)/Teff )^4 - 1 ]

So the fractional dip is |delta_F| = f [ 1 - ( (Teff - deltaT)/Teff )^4 ]

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

f = 0.2, Teff = 6000 K, deltaT = 1000 K.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Let me compute that.

(5/6) is approximately 0.8333. To the 4th power: 0.8333^2 is about 0.6944, squared again is about 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% dip.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the star is being observed as having periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation, which mimics an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots is about 10.35%.

But if the exoplanet were causing the same dip, what radius would it have?

The dip caused by a planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.1035).

Compute sqrt(0.1035): sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316, sqrt(0.1035)= approx 0.322.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, f is 0.2. So the fractional dip from the spots is 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4] = 0.2 * [1 - 0.482253] = 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355% of the star's brightness.

For a planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the dip is 10.355% = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Thus, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options:

Option D) ~0.32

Option A) ~0.39

Option C) ~0.11

So the closest is option D, 0.32.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, the problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully facing us.

But when the star is viewed with the spots on the far side, the brightness is at maximum (F_unspotted). So the variation in brightness is between F_unspotted and F_spotted.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the maximum change. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the amplitude as (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted.

Because when the spots are on the near side, the observed flux is lower than when they're on the far side. So the brightness varies between F_unspotted and F_spotted.

So the amplitude is the difference between these two.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the brightness goes from F_unspotted (when the spots are on the far side) to F_spotted (when the spots are on the near side). So the variation is between F_unspotted (maximum brightness) and F_spotted (minimum brightness).

So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted = 1 - (F_spotted / F_unspotted).

Which is exactly the same as the delta_F I calculated earlier.

So the dip is about 10.35% of the star's brightness.

So the planet's dip would need to be the same 10.35% dip, which implies (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322.

So the answer would be approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but I just realized that the spot covers only one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the maximum dip occurs when as much spot area is visible as possible. But the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots take up 20% of that area.

Wait, no. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area. But the hemisphere is half the star, so the spots are 10% of the star's total area.

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the stellar disk covered by spots. If the star has a hemisphere covered with a 20% filling factor, that means 20% of the surface area of the hemisphere is spots. Since the hemisphere is half the star, the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (pi R^2 / 2) ) = 0.1 pi R^2. The total star area is pi R^2, so the spots are 10% of the star's surface.

So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots are 10% of the star's surface. So when the other hemisphere is facing, the spots are 10% of the star's surface on the far side but we don't see them.

Wait, but when the spots are on the near side, the fraction of the star we see that's spotted is 10% of the total star. So the calculation I did earlier considers the entire star's surface, with 10% spots and 90% unspotted.

Wait, no. Because the filling factor is per hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere is spotted. But since the hemisphere is half the star, 20% of half is 10% of the total star. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 10% of the star's surface is spotted. So the same as if the entire star had a 10% filling factor.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the filling factor as 0.2 (20%) for the entire star? Because the star has one hemisphere covered with spots, and each hemisphere is 50% of the star. So the spots are 20% of 50%, which is 10% of the total surface.

So the overall f is 0.1 in the previous calculations. Oh wait, I made a mistake earlier. So f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere is covered with 20% spots, f is 0.2 * (1/2) = 0.1.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

- The star's total surface area is 4 pi R², but when observing it, we see a disk of area pi R² (since it's a sphere, but we see a circle of radius R).

- The star has one hemisphere (half the surface) covered in spots. The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) / 2 )? Wait, no, the surface area of a hemisphere is 2 pi R² (since the total surface area is 4 pi R², a hemisphere is half that, 2 pi R²).

So filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so spots area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

But the total area of the star is 4 pi R². So f (the filling factor) is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, or 10%.

Wait, no, that's if the hemisphere is the entire area. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4 pi R². Each hemisphere has a surface area of 2 pi R². So when the star has one hemisphere covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%, the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So the total area covered by spots is 0.4 pi R². The total surface area is 4 pi R². So f = 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1, or 10%.

So in my earlier calculation, I used f=0.2, which was incorrect. Because the spot area is 10% of the total star's surface, not 20%. So f=0.1.

So I need to recalculate with f=0.1.

Let me redo the calculation with f=0.1.

Compute delta_F = f [1 - ( (Teff - deltaT)/Teff )^4 ]

Teff = 6000 K, deltaT=1000 K.

(Teff - deltaT) =5000 K.

(5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, which is about 5.177% dip.

So the fractional dip is approximately 5.177%.

So for the exoplanet, delta_F_planet = (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match 0.23, but the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these are close to 0.23. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the f. Let me double-check the problem statement.

The problem says: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of the area of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of the surface area of one hemisphere.

Each hemisphere is half the star's surface area. So the star's total surface area is 4 pi R², so one hemisphere is 2 pi R².

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The total area of the star is 4 pi R², so f = 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1.

So f is 0.1, so the dip is about 5.177%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view only when that hemisphere is facing us. So the dip is not just the 10% area but the difference between when the hemisphere is spotted and when it's not.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is spotted and facing us. If the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, but when the hemisphere is facing us, the spot coverage is 20% of that hemisphere's area.

Wait, maybe I should model this as the star's surface being divided into two hemispheres. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of it is spots. So the area of spots visible is 20% of 2 pi R² (the area of a hemisphere) when that hemisphere is facing us. So when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere facing, the spot coverage is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R², but the total area of the star we see is pi R² (the area of the disk). Wait, no, the area of the star's disk is pi R², but the star's surface is a sphere. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the area of the star's disk (as seen from Earth) is pi R². The surface area of the star is 4 pi R². So when the star is viewed with a hemisphere facing us, the area of that hemisphere is 2 pi R², but the area we see (the disk) is pi R². Wait, that's not correct. The area of the stellar disk is pi R^2, but the surface area of the hemisphere is 2 pi R^2 (since the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi R², a hemisphere is half, so 2 pi R²).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of flux.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma Teff^4.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4.

Wait, but the spot area is f times the hemisphere, but when the hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots in the disk is f * (hemisphere area) / 2? No, perhaps I should think as follows.

When the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere facing us, the fraction of the disk that is spotted is f. Because the hemisphere has a filling factor of f=0.2, but the hemisphere is 50% of the disk area. So when viewed from Earth, the area of the spots is f * (hemisphere area) / (total disk area). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of the disk covered by spots when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is f. Because the filling factor is per hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing, f is 20% of the disk's area.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the disk's area is pi R², and the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the disk area is pi R², but the actual area on the star is 2 pi R². So the spots cover 20% of 2 pi R², which is 0.4 pi R². So in the disk, which is pi R², the fraction of spots is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4, or 40%? That can't be right because that would imply that when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the disk is spotted, which would give a much larger dip.

But that contradicts the problem statement, which says that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the disk. So perhaps I need to model it correctly.

Wait, the area of the star's surface that's spotted is f = 0.2 * (area of the hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

The area of the star's disk (the part we see) is pi R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of the disk covered by spots is 0.4 pi R² (since the spots are on the near side, which is the same as the disk). So the fraction of the disk covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (pi R²) ) = 0.4, which is 40% of the disk.

But that would make the dip much larger, which doesn't make sense with the options given. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the disk area covered when the hemisphere is facing us. So the area of the disk is pi R², and the spots cover f = 0.2 of that, so 0.2 pi R².

But the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of 2 pi R², so 0.4 pi R². But when the hemisphere is facing us, the disk area is pi R², so the spots cover 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 40% of the disk. But that would imply a much larger dip than the options suggest.

But this leads to a dip of f=0.4 in the earlier calculation, which would be a much larger dip.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's surface area, but when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2 pi R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the disk we see is pi R², and the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4, or 40%.

So f=0.4 in this case. So the fractional dip is 0.4 [1 - (5/6)^4 ].

Compute (5/6)^4 = 0.4823 as before.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.4: 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.207, or about 20.7% dip.

Then, for the planet, the dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.207 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.454, which is about 0.45, but that's not one of the options. The closest option is A) ~0.39.

Wait, but that would mean the dip caused by the spots is about 20.7%, and the planet would need to cause the same dip, implying a radius of about 0.45 Rstar, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, but this doesn't match any of the given options. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star rotates, the spots only cover a fraction of the disk at any given time, leading to a varying dip. But in the case of a planet, the dip is maximum when the planet is in front of the star.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average brightness variation due to the spots. Or maybe only part of the star's surface is spotted, leading to a smaller dip.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The problem states that the star's brightness varies due to the spots. The amplitude of this variation is the same as that caused by the planet.

So the amplitude caused by the spots is the maximum dip when the spots are fully visible. So the dip is (f) [ (Teff^4 - (Teff - deltaT)^4 ) ] / Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the dip as follows.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

F0 is sigma Teff^4.

F_spot is sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4.

So the dip is (F0 - F) / F0 = [ F0 - ( (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot ) ] / F0

= [ F0 (1 - (1-f)) - f F_spot ] / F0

= [ f F0 - f F_spot ] / F0

= f [ F0 - F_spot ] / F0

= f [ 1 - (F_spot / F0) ]

= f [ 1 - ( (Teff - deltaT)/Teff )^4 ]

So with f=0.2 (if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, but when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface, so f=0.1).

Wait, this is getting me back to the earlier calculation where f=0.1.

So, delta_F = 0.1 * [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, a 5.177% dip.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this value.

Looking back, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none match 0.2275. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, not per hemisphere. So the problem says one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, no, that can't be because the entire star's surface is 100%, and one hemisphere is 50%. So 20% of one hemisphere would be 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

But perhaps I should compute the actual flux from the star when the spots are visible.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view, and the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_spotted = F0 * ( (1 - f) + f (T_spot/Teff)^4 )

The maximum flux is F0, when the spots are on the far side.

The minimum flux is F_spotted.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotted)/F0 = f [ 1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ].

So with f=0.1, T_spot=5000 K, Teff=6000 K.

So amplitude is 0.1 * [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177.

So Rp^2/Rstar^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But again, this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's temperature is different from the spots, but when the spots are on the near side, the observed flux is lower. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness when spots are on the near side is F = F_unspotted - f (F_unspotted - F_spotted).

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fractional change when the spots are on the near side.

Wait, let's compute it as:

The total flux when spots are on the near side is:

F_spotted = (1 - f) * F_unspotted + f * F_spot.

But F_unspotted is sigma Teff^4.

F_spot is sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4.

So F_spotted = (1 - f) sigma Teff^4 + f sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4.

The fractional change is (F_spotted - F_unspotted)/F_unspotted = [ (1-f) sigma Teff^4 + f sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4 - sigma Teff^4 ] / sigma Teff^4 = [ -f sigma Teff^4 + f sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4 ] / sigma Teff^4 = f [ (Teff - deltaT)^4 - Teff^4 ] / Teff^4 = f [ (Teff - deltaT / Teff )^4 - 1 ].

Wait, this is the same as earlier, so the dip is f [ ( (Teff - deltaT)/Teff )^4 - 1 ].

Which with f=0.1 gives a dip of about 5.177%.

So if the planet causes the same dip, its radius is sqrt(0.05177) Rstar ≈ 0.2275 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me check the initial problem statement again.

Problem says: "the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K."

So the spots are 5000K.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 ≈ 0.5177.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.05177.

So the dip is about 5.177%.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.05177) Rstar ≈ 0.2275 Rstar.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in f.

Alternative approach: perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area when viewed from Earth, not the actual surface area.

Wait, the star's disk area is pi R². The hemisphere has a surface area of 2 pi R². So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². But the disk area is pi R², so the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4, or 40%.

So f=0.4.

Then delta_F = 0.4 [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.207.

So the dip is about 20.7%.

Then Rp^2 = 0.207 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.454, which is about 0.45. The closest option is A) ~0.39.

But none of the options is close to 0.45, except perhaps A.

But this doesn't align with the options either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is caused by the rotational modulation of the spots, so the maximum dip occurs when the maximum area of spots is visible. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum dip is when that hemisphere is facing us, so the dip is f * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ].

Wait, but if the whole hemisphere is covered in spots, the dip would be 0.5 * [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ].

Wait, but the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not 100%.

So the maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, and 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. So the dip is (0.2) * [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ].

Wait, but wait, the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R², and 20% of that is 0.4 pi R². The area of the disk is pi R². So the fraction of the disk covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (pi R²) ) = 0.4. So f=0.4.

So dip is 0.4 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.4 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.207.

So the planet's dip needs to be 0.207, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.207) ≈ 0.454.

But again, this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's spots are on the hemisphere, and when it rotates, the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a varying dip. The amplitude would be the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they're not.

But I'm not getting any of the options matching. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is that the spots cause a dimming when they're on the near side, but when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, leading to a periodic brightness variation with an amplitude equal to the dip caused by the spots.

So the dip is f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ].

With f=0.2 (if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, but when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface. So f=0.1.

Dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177 → 5.177% dip.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But no option matches this.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is ~0.11, which is (0.11)^2 = 0.0121. That's much smaller than 0.05177.

Option D is ~0.32 → 0.1024. Close to 0.05177? No, 0.05177 is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is caused by the spots being in the hemisphere, and the brightness when the spots are on the far side is maximum, and when on the near side is minimum.

The brightness when the spots are on the far side: F_unspotted = sigma Teff^4.

Brightness when the spots are on the near side: F_spotted = (1 - f) sigma Teff^4 + f sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4.

So the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted = [ sigma Teff^4 - ( (1-f) sigma Teff^4 + f sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4 ) ] / sigma Teff^4 = [ f ( sigma Teff^4 - sigma (Teff - deltaT)^4 ) ] / sigma Teff^4 = f [ 1 - ( (Teff - deltaT)/Teff )^4 ].

With f=0.1, dip ≈ 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1 *0.5177=0.05177.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is 6000K, but the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. So their contribution is less.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual dip in brightness.

Compute (5/6)^4 = (625 / 1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.051775.

So dip is 5.1775% → Rp^2 = 0.051775 → Rp = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Still no match.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is ~0.11 → 0.0121. That would be a dip of 1.21%.

Option D is ~0.32 → 0.1024 dip.

None of these match 0.051775.

So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial assumption about the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the rotational modulation, and the maximum dip is when the spots are on the near side. But the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the dip varies between 0 and the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is f_hemi [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ], where f_hemi is the filling factor of the hemisphere.

Wait, f_hemi is 20%, so 0.2.

So dip = 0.2 [1 - (5/6)^4 ] ≈ 0.2 *0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

Then the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322.

Which matches option D) ~0.32.

Ah, perhaps that's the correct approach. Because when the entire hemisphere is covered by spots with a filling factor of 20%, the maximum dip is when that hemisphere is facing us, and the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area.

But wait, the star's disk area is pi R², and the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the area of the disk is pi R². The area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R², but this is the area on the hemisphere. However, the disk area is pi R², so the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 0.4 pi R² / pi R² = 0.4, or 40%. So f=0.4.

But this leads to a dip of 0.4 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.207, and Rp ≈ 0.454, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R². Then, when the star is viewed, the maximum area of spots visible is 0.8 pi R², but the disk area is pi R², so the fraction is 0.8 pi R² / pi R² = 0.8, which is 80% spots, leading to a very large dip. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 10% (since hemisphere is 50% of the surface).

So f=0.1.

Then dip is 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.05177 → Rp=0.2275.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on the hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots are only partially visible. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is not the maximum dip but the average variation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots go from being fully visible to not visible at all, leading to a sinusoidal variation in the brightness. The amplitude of this variation would be the average dip.

But I'm not sure how to model that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the problem as the star's brightness varying as the spots rotate into and out of view, leading to a sinusoidal light curve with an amplitude equal to the dip caused by the spots.

But I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest match when f=0.1 is 0.2275, which isn't an option. But when f=0.2 (if the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface), dip is 0.2 *0.51775=0.10355 → Rp=0.322.

Which matches option D) ~0.32.

So perhaps the correct approach is to take f=0.2, leading to Rp=0.32.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Star Properties**:  
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.  
   - The star's effective temperature is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and the spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Filling Factor and Brightness Variation**:  
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to the hemisphere. Since the hemisphere represents half the star's surface, the total fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is \( f = 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \).  
   - The fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible is given by:  
     \[
     \Delta F = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
     \]  
     Substituting \( f = 0.1 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):  
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]  
     Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823 \):  
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 \left[ 1 - 0.4823 \right] = 0.1 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.05177
     \]  
     This corresponds to a brightness dip of approximately \( 5.177\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:  
   - The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]  
     To match the brightness variation caused by the spots, set \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.05177
     \]  
     Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2275
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options directly. However, revisiting the problem with the assumption that the filling factor \( f = 0.2 \) (interpreting it as 20% of the star's total surface area rather than the hemisphere) leads to:  
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.10355
     \]  
     Then:  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
     \]  
     This matches closely with option **D) ~0.32**.

Thus, assuming the filling factor applies to the star's total surface area, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).
