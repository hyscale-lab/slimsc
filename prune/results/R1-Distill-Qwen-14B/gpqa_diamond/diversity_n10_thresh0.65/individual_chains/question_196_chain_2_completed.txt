Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I can't use the classical equations of motion; I need to consider special relativity effects.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. Let's think about what I know.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a spring, potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the relativistic case, so the answer can't be that because relativistic effects change the energy equations.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's total energy. The total energy of a particle is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but in this case, since it's a bound system, perhaps it's better to think in terms of total mechanical energy.

Wait, the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². So the total energy E should equal the relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy. But wait, maybe the problem is using the relativistic version of the harmonic oscillator. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, maybe the system's total energy is quantized, but no, the question is about a classical oscillator. So for maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma -1)mc²? Or wait, the total energy E is gamma mc², which includes the rest mass energy. So perhaps when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and at maximum speed, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², so equate them: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic case, so it's option C. But since we're in the relativistic scenario, this can't be the case. So the correct approach must consider relativistic effects.

So the total mechanical energy for the oscillator in the relativistic case would have to be the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. But how do these energies relate? Let me think.

In the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but this is a classical problem. So perhaps the total energy E is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies, each expressed in their relativistic forms.

Wait, the potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kx², same as before. The kinetic energy is relativistic, which is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, another approach is that the total energy E is γ mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So at maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, which is (γ - 1) mc². So, when x=0, E = (γ -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So setting (γ -1) mc² equals (1/2)k A². Let me write that down:

(γ - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

But wait, is the potential energy in the relativistic case still (1/2)k x²? I think for the harmonic oscillator, yeah, because the force is F = -k x, which is non-relativistic, but the motion is relativistic. Hmm, maybe the potential is the same. So the approach would be that the total energy (which is conserved) is the sum of potential and kinetic.

Wait, another way: in the non-relativistic case, the total energy E is (1/2)k A², and at x=0, that's (1/2)mv_max². Relativistically, the kinetic energy would be higher because as velocity increases, the relativistic mass increases, so the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv².

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to write the energy equations. So E = (1/2)kA² (since at x=A, v=0, so all energy is potential). At the point of maximum speed, x=0, so all energy is kinetic. But relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc². So E = (γ -1) mc².

So, (1/2) k A² = (γ -1) mc².

We can solve for γ. Let's rearrange:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Because (1/2)k A² = (γ-1) m c² → γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, (k A²)/(2 m c²) = t.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + t.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + t).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + t)^2.

Rearranged,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + t)^2.

Factor the right-hand side:

= [ (1 + t)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + t)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2t + t²) -1 = 2t + t² = t(2 + t).

So,

v²/c² = [ t (2 + t) ] / (1 + t)^2.

Then,

v = c * sqrt( [ t(2 + t) ] / (1 + t)^2 ).

Plug t back in, t = k A²/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ).

Let me simplify the numerator inside the square root:

Numerator inside: (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ]

Denominator inside: (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Let me factor (k A²/(2 m c²)) as s for easier writing.

So s = k A²/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ s (2 + s) ] / (1 + s)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ s (2 + s) ] ) / (1 + s).

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

s (2 + s) = s (s + 2) = s² + 2s.

Denominator is (1 + s)^2 = 1 + 2s + s².

So,

v = c * sqrt( [s² + 2s] / (1 + 2s + s²) ) )

= c * sqrt( [ s(s + 2) ] / ( (s + 1)^2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as s (s + 2) = s² + 2s.

Wait, denominator is (s + 1)^2 = s² + 2s + 1.

So,

[s² + 2s] / [s² + 2s + 1] = [s (s +2)] / (s +1)^2.

Wait, perhaps it can be written as:

[s (s+2)] / (s+1)^2 = [ (s+1 -1)(s+1 +1) ) ] / (s+1)^2.

Which is ( (s+1)^2 -1 ) / (s+1)^2.

Wait, (s+1 -1)(s+1 +1) = (s)(s+2). So,

= [ (s+1)^2 -1 ] / (s+1)^2.

So,

= 1 - [1/(s+1)^2 ].

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(s + 1)^2 ] )

= c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + s)^2 ) )

Because s = k A²/(2 m c²), s + 1 = 1 + s = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ), which is exactly what I have here. So that's option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Let me look again:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Yes, that looks correct.

But wait, in my earlier steps, I assumed that the total energy E is (1/2) k A^2, which is the potential energy when x=A. But wait, is that correct in the relativistic case?

Hmm, perhaps I should question my initial assumption. Does the potential energy for a relativistic oscillator remain (1/2)kx²? Because in special relativity, the force might be treated differently.

Wait, the problem states the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², same as before. So I think my initial approach holds.

But wait, let's consider another approach. Maybe the energy isn't just potential and kinetic as I thought. Maybe the total energy is different.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point, it's all kinetic. But in the relativistic case, perhaps the energy is the sum of both potentials and kinetic, but I don't think that's the case because when x is maximum, velocity is zero, so all the energy should be potential. So E = (1/2)k A^2.

Wait, but if the oscillator is relativistic, perhaps the force isn't F = -kx, but maybe it's handled differently. Hmm, but the problem states F = -kx, so I think we can proceed as before.

So the maximum speed is given by option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both potential and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is expressed as \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]
Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we get:
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]
Let \( t = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), then:
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + t}.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + t)^2}.
\]
Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + t)^2}.
\]
Substituting \( t = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:
- Option A and B involve incorrect forms of the Lorentz factor or energy equations.
- Option C corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
