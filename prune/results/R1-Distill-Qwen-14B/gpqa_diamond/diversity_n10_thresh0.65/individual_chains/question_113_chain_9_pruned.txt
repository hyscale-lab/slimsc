Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to determine which one is correct based on the spectral data provided.

Let me break down the given information.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So that's likely an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have very strong, broad O-H stretches, so that's a possibility. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad peak too.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something like conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, another thought: 1650 could be an amide I band, but I don't see any nitrogen in the options, so probably not. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone in an aromatic system.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically the ones in double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond somewhere. That probably means we're dealing with something like an ester, maybe with an alkene group.

Looking at the mass spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. I'm trying to think of what fragments would give that. 45 is a common mass; for example, it could be a CH3CO group (which is 43, wait, no, maybe not). Alternatively, it could be a fragment like (CH2O) if it's a
