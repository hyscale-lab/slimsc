Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So, distance r ≈ 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Wait, no, it's N ∝ 1/(plx^5). So, N is inversely proportional to plx^5.

But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate this to distance r. Since r is about 1/plx, I can express plx in terms of r. So, plx = 1/r. That's right because if r increases, plx decreases, which makes sense.

Let me substitute plx with 1/r into the equation. So, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. Therefore, N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1/(plx^5) is 1/(1/r^5) which is r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5.

But the question asks about the change in the number of stars per unit range of distance. Oh wait, does that mean the number per distance interval, like dN/dr? Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the derivative dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4. But wait, the options don't have r^4 as the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: ~ r^3, B: ~ r^5, C: ~ r^4, D: ~ r^2.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, the number increases rapidly. But wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, maybe it's asking about the rate of change. Like, how many more stars are there as you go a certain distance away.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.

The number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k/(plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k r^5. So N increases with r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's about the differential change. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr
