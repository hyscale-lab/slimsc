Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexyl group. And on the same carbon as the substituent, there's an aldehyde group. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse that again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehydeâ€”so a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2-CHO group attached. But at position 1, which is the same carbon as the CHO, there's a methyl group substituted with both cyclohexyl and hydroxy groups.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. So the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group, and at the same carbon as the aldehyde, a methyl group that's attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would be cyclohexane with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH
