Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup given is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I think S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix Ay would be:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, but wait, actually, the matrix S is given, and Ay is c multiplied by each element of S. So the first element of Ay would be c*0, second element c*(-i), etc. So the matrix is:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

But wait, looking again, the matrix S has elements (0, -i) in the first row, (i, 0) in the second. So when multiplied by c, each element is scaled by c. So Ay becomes:

Ay = c*S → each element is multiplied by c.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So the setup is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and we need to find its eigenvalues.

So, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So let's write Ay as:

Ay = [[0, -i c],
       [i c, 0]]

Wait, because c = h/(4π), so substituting, each element is c times the S elements.

But when calculating the determinant, perhaps we can factor out c from the matrix. Alternatively, proceed directly.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i c ]
[ i c, 0 ]

So the characteristic equation is:

| Ay - λ I | = 0
→ | -λ   -i c |
    | i c   -λ | = 0
