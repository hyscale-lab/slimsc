Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. So, we've got a star with certain parameters, and we're looking at how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Hmm, the star's initial parameters are 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. Interesting. Oh wait, but wait, the spots are dark, so they're cooler regions. So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the star decreases.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”so when no spots (normal) versus when spots are present.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio n1/n2 is observed to decrease when spots are present. So, without spots, the Teff is higher (6000 K), and with spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K
