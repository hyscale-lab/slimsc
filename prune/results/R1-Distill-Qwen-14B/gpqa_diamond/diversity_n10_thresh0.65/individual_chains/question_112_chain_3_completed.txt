Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, the problem involves an electron's spin state and some operator. I'll take it step by step.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So first, I should probably normalize this state. Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so I might need to find the normalization factor later on.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's think about the matrix dimensions. Since the state is spin, it's a two-level system, so the matrix is 2x2. So, the elements are A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x. Because sigma_x has elements 0,1;1,0.

So the operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are 1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator. Oh, so the operator's eigenstates are the basis we need to express |alpha> in. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, which are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me verify that. Because sigma_x flips the spin. So those are the eigenstates, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

Wait, but the operator A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, right? Because A = (hbar/2) sigma_x. So yes, the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's.

So to find the probabilities, I need to expand |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates of A. Alternatively, I can compute the inner products of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, square the magnitudes to get the probabilities.

But first, I should normalize |alpha>. Let me compute the normalization factor. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product of |alpha> with itself is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Wait, |1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1+1=2. Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the eigenstates of A are, as I thought, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no. Wait, sigma_x has eigenstates |+x> and |−x> which are the states I just wrote. So yes, any state can be expressed as a linear combination of these.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, then the coefficients will give me the probability amplitudes, and their squared magnitudes will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, I could compute the expectation value of the operator A, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But let's first tackle the probabilities. Let me express |alpha> in the |+x> and |−x> basis.

So |alpha> is in the standard basis (|up>, |down>), so perhaps I can find the components in the |+x>, |−x> basis.

So, let me write |alpha> as c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting, |alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down> .

But |alpha> is given as [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So equating coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 +i ) / sqrt(7)
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i ) / sqrt(7)

Hmm, so I can set up two equations. Let me denote the coefficients as:

Equation 1: (c_+ + c_-) = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: (c_+ - c_-) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Wait, because when I multiply both sides by sqrt(2), I get:

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So adding these two equations:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_+ = (3) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)) )
= [ (-1 + 2i) ]/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, equation 1: c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → let me call this term A.
Equation 2: c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → term B.

Adding A and B: 2 c_+ = (1+i + 2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_+ = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) ) → which simplifies to 3/(sqrt(14)).

Subtracting B from A: 2 c_- = (1+i - 2 +i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = [ (-1 + 2i) ]/(sqrt(14)).

So now I have c_+ and c_-. The probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Let's compute |c_+|²:

c_+ = 3/sqrt(14)
So |c_+|² = (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

And |c_-|²: | (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |² = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, about 0.36. Wait, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → that would match 9/14 = 0.6428 and 5/14=0.357. But looking at the options, option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36. So that's close. But wait, let me think again. Are these the correct probabilities?

Wait, but wait another moment. Because when I expressed |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients are c_+ and c_-, and their squares would give the probabilities of measuring the corresponding eigenvalues. But the eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So we have:

|c_+|² = (3)^2 / (14) =9/14 ≈0.642857 → approximately 0.64.

|c_-|² = ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.35714 → about 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, the average value part is also needed.

Wait, the average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Another approach: Since A is the operator, its expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities. So:

<A> = (hbar/2) * (probability of eigenvalue +hbar/2 ) + (-hbar/2) * (probability of eigenvalue -hbar/2 )

Which would be (hbar/2)(9/14) + (-hbar/2)(5/14) ) = (hbar/2) [ (9 -5)/14 ] = (hbar/2)(4/14) ) = (hbar/2)(2/7) ) = hbar/(7).

Wait, because 9/14 is the probability for +hbar/2, and 5/14 is for -hbar/2.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A's average is hbar/7, which would match. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to compute the average is to calculate <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressing A in matrix form: it's (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

The state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So in vector form, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) , (2 +i) ] * (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, the matrix multiplication part:

A |alpha> vector is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

So,

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ (0*(1+i) + 1*(2 -i) ), (1*(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Which simplifies to:

( hbar/2 ) / sqrt(7) [ (2 -i), (1 +i) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> times A|alpha>.

So:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) , (2 +i) ] * (hbar/2) [ (2 -i), (1 +i) ] / sqrt(7).

So multiply the vectors:

= (hbar/2) * [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ) ] / (7).

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i - 2i + i²
i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 + i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + i²
i² is -1, so 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Adding these together: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the whole expression is (hbar/2) * (2) /7 = hbar/(7).

Which matches the earlier result. So the average is hbar/7.

So putting it all together: the probabilities are approximately 0.64 (9/14) and 0.36 (5/14), and the average is hbar/7. So the option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A says the average value is hbar/7, which matches. So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron's spin state and an operator \( A \) with a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The goal is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \) and the average value of \( A \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, which are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
The corresponding eigenvalues are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+\rangle, |-\rangle \) basis
Substitute \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \):
\[
|\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+\rangle + |-\rangle \right), \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+\rangle - |-\rangle \right).
\]
Substituting into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+\rangle + |-\rangle \right) + (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+\rangle - |-\rangle \right) \right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i + 2-i)|+\rangle + (1+i - (2-i))|-\rangle \right).
\]
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( 3|+\rangle + (-1+2i)|-\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The coefficients of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are \( c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \), respectively. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:
\[
P(|+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} P(|+\rangle) + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) P(|-\rangle).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} - \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
