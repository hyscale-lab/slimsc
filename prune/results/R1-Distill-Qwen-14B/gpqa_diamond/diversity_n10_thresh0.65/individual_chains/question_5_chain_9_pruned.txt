Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices. They’re asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, so I remember that the operator for the angular momentum along an arbitrary direction n (which is a unit vector) is given by the dot product of n with the vector of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Wait, but in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n must be zero. So n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π/2 or something. Wait, no—the x-z plane is where y=0. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

But wait, the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of θ and φ, but since y is zero, maybe φ isn't involved here. Or perhaps the direction can be parameterized by θ only, since the angle in the x-z plane can be θ from the x-axis, making n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Oh wait, but for a general direction in x-z, we can represent it as (sinθ cosϕ, 0, sinθ sinϕ), but wait, that's not correct. Let me think—no, in the x-z plane, the standard parameterization is usually with polar angles, but perhaps it's easier to think of it as n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

So, the operator P is along direction n, so P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0.

But wait, the problem gives us
