Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Alright, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, that's the concentration of the complex formed, right? Wait, stochiometric... I think that means 1:1 ratio, so one Ca to one EDTA. 

The question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Oh right, because EDTA binds Ca²+ and forms a complex. So the total calcium is in the complex, but some might dissociate.

The given K value is KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. Oh, I think that's the formation constant, Kf. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but the solution is at pH where the EDTA is in the right form. So, I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA, which is good because that can complicate things.

So, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let me think about the equilibrium.

The formation constant equation is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in solution, the EDTA is in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh wait, the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe EDTA is already in the Y^4- form. Or perhaps the dissociation of EDTA into Y^4- is accounted for, so I can treat the solution as having [Y^4-] as a known quantity.

Wait, but the concentration of Y^4- would depend on the pH. Since the problem states pH is ideal, I might not need to calculate it. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the concentration of Y^4- is 1 M, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach: when EDTA is present, the total concentration of EDTA species is the sum of all forms, including the complex. But the problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So, the total EDTA (free plus complex) would be the sum of [Y^4-] plus [CaEDTA^2-]. But without knowing the dissociation constants of EDTA, maybe this approach is complicated.

Wait, perhaps another way. Since the Kf is very large (5x10^10), that implies that the complex is very stable. So, the majority of Ca²+ ions are bound by EDTA, and the concentration of free Ca²+ is very low.

Wait, the formation constant is so large, so the reaction tends to go to the right. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be very small compared to [CaEDTA^2-], which is 0.02 M.

But wait, let's write the expression again. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/
