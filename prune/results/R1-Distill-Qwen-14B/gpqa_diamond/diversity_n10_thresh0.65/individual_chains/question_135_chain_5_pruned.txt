Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the problem gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f fψ_f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh right, the ψ_f probably represents fermions of different types. So the interaction term involves X(y) coupling to fermion fields.

Since the boson X is interacting with fermions, the decay products of X would be fermion-antifermion pairs. For example, X → ff̄. But I need to find which fermions are possible.

The key thing here is the mass of X, which is 6 GeV. The decay is kinematically allowed if the mass of X is greater than twice the mass of the fermion, because each fermion (and antifermion) would take away some energy.

So I need to list the possible fermions (quarks and leptons) whose mass is less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the masses of the known particles. Let's list them:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV. Super light.
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 95 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV.
- Electron (e-): 0.511 MeV.
- Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV.
- Neutrinos: almost massless, but maybe negligible.

So, for the decay X → ff̄, the maximum mass each fermion can have is 3 GeV
