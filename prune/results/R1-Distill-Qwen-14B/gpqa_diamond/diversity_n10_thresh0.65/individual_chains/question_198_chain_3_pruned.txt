Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant exactly? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, for each complex, the higher β means it's more favored.

The question is about the percentage of the blue ones. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, maybe? Or wait, wait—dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ions. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^(?), etc. Wait, what are the possible complexes here?

Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n varies. Let me think about possible complexes. For Co(II), which is +2 charge, when it forms complexes with SCN- (which is -1 each), the charge on the complex would be Co^2+ + m SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_m]^(2 - m) ?

Wait, but the stability constants given are β1, β2, etc. So each β corresponds to a different number of SCN- ligands. Like β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on.

So the complexes would be:

- For β1: [CoSCN]^+ → because Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2+ + (-1) = +1)

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think. The general formula for the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^(3−n), because Co^2+ plus n SCN^- (each -1) would have charge 2 - n. So for n=1, it's 1- charge
