Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data given are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The Doppler shift depends on the star's velocity towards and away from us, which in turn is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital characteristics.

Wait, the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to other parameters is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (some exponent maybe?)) Wait, no, let me get the exact formula. 

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2 π G) / (P c ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like star), M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2 π G) / (P c ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )

Alternatively, I've sometimes seen it written as K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²) ) )^(1/2) ) ) * ( (2 π ) / P )^(1/3) )

But that might complicate things. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relationship between K and the orbital period P, given that M_p and M_star are similar in both cases.

Wait, the two stars have the same mass, so M_star is the same for both. The planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both as well. So M_p is same. Star masses same, so M_star same. So what varies is the shift K, which is given in the problem. 

Wait, the problem says that the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So K is proportional to the shift in wavelength. Because the Doppler shift (radial velocity) is what causes the spectral line shift. So K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the same as the shift in the spectral line's wavelength.

Wait, no. The shift in wavelength is given by the Doppler formula. The Doppler shift (z) is approximately v/c, where v is the radial velocity. So, K (the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is equal to the shift in velocity, and the shift in wavelength is (lambda shift) = (v/c) * lambda. But for small shifts, z ≈ v/c, so the shift in wavelength (delta lambda) is approximately (K) * lambda / c.

Wait, but in the problem, they're talking about the same spectral line at a given wavelength. So let's say the same line in both stars. So the shift in wavelength would be delta_lambda = (K) * lambda / c. 

So delta_lambda ∝ K.

Therefore, the ratio of the shifts (delta_lambda2 / delta_lambda1) is equal to K2 / K1.

So, let's compute K1 and K2.

K1 = 5 milliangstroms and K2 =7 milliangstroms. So K2 = (7/5) * K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no: the question says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and #2 is 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5=1.4.

But how does K relate to the orbital period P?

I think the key is to find the relationship between K and P. Because the question is about the ratio of the periods P2/P1.

We can write the formula for K as:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( ( M_p sin i ) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) * c )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both, and assuming sin i is same (i.e., orbits are edge-on, or same for both), which the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps we can assume it's the same or that sin i doesn't affect the ratio. So in the ratio K2/K1 = [ ( (P1)^(1/3) ) / ( (P2)^(1/3) ) ) ] 

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). 

So, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We have K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4 → (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, let's cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

(7/5)^3 = 343 / 125 ≈ 2.744

So P1/P2 ≈ 2.744 → P2/P1 ≈ 1/2.744 ≈ 0.365.

Wait wait, no. Let me think again. 

Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So:

K1 ∝ 1/P1^(1/3)

K2 ∝ 1/P2^(1/3)

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: 343/125 = P1/P2 → P2 = (125/343) P1

So P2 = (125/343) P1 → P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. 

Wait, the question says: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 0.36 times P1. So it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so it's 0.36 times as long. So how many times longer? It's longer? No, it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure the setup is correct. So the formula: K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So as K increases, P decreases.

In this case, Planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5), so P2 should be smaller. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

So the question is: How many times is the orbital period of Planet #2 longer than that of Planet #1? So it's 0.36 times. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Because sometimes I mix up the exponents. Let's write the formula again.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 pi / P) )^(1/3) * c^(-1)

Wait, no, perhaps better to write the formula as:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Assuming circular orbit, so e=0, so denominator is 1. So, K = ( (2 π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

So since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → 343/125 = P1/P2 → P2 = (125/343) P1.

So P2 = (125/343) P1 → P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So the answer is option A, which is approximately 0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K = \left( \frac{2 \pi G}{P c} \right)^{1/3} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_\text{star} + M_p)^{2/3}}
\]

Since both stars have the same mass (\( M_\text{star} \)) and both planets have similar masses (\( M_p \)), and assuming circular orbits (\( e = 0 \)), the formula simplifies to:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This means \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). The ratio of the shifts in the spectral lines (\( \Delta \lambda \)) is proportional to the ratio of the semi-amplitudes (\( K \)), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda_2}{\Delta \lambda_1} = \frac{K_2}{K_1}
\]

From the problem, \( \Delta \lambda_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( \Delta \lambda_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), so:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Using the proportionality \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4 \):

\[
1.4 = \left( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
1.4^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

\[
2.744 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2/P_1 \):

\[
P_2/P_1 = \frac{1}{2.744} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is **not** longer but shorter than that of Planet #1.
