Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these four.

Hmm, I remember that the SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible interactions that can occur at low energies, beyond the Standard Model, but respecting certain symmetries. The idea is that the Standard Model (SM) is the renormalizable theory, and SMEFT adds higher-dimensional operators.

Wait, what's the deal with symmetries in effective theories? Well, the SMEFT is supposed to be a valid low-energy effective theory. So it should preserve the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Wait, does it respect CP symmetry? No, because the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but maybe the SMEFT's operators should respect certain symmetries.

Wait, in SMEFT, operators are classified by their dimension. The operators must respect the symmetries of the SM, right? So the SM's gauge symmetry is SU(2)_L × SU(3)_c × U(1)_Y, but the question is about other global symmetries.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because all interactions in the SM are Lorentz-invariant, so SMEFT operators must also be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely respected.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. Since the operators in SMEFT are local (they don't involve non-local terms), Poincare symmetry is also respected. Because when you write down terms like (Dμ ψ)† (D^μ ψ), those are Poincare invariant. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Then what about CP and CPT? The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but SMEFT operators could violate CP if the SM itself does. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if an operator violates CP, then it doesn't respect CP symmetry. But does that mean that the
