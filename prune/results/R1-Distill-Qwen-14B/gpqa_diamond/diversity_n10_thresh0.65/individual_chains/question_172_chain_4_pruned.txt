Okay, so I've got this astrophysics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the key here is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. Also, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means I can use the Boltzmann equation for this scenario.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Right, here, n_i and n_j are the populations of the two energy levels, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j their energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this problem, the excitation level of star_1's iron atoms is twice that of star_2. I'm assuming that the excitation refers to the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one. So, maybe the ratio n_i/n_j is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Or wait, the question says that the excited state is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps in star_1, the population of the excited level is twice as much as in star_2's same level. Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited level to the ground level. Not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.

Let me think: For each star, the ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on temperature. Since the problem says the energy difference is given, I can set up the equation for each star and then relate the two.

So for star 1:
n1_i / n1_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

Similarly for star 2:
n2_i / n2_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But wait, the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps the ratio n_i/n_j is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j).

But alternatively, maybe each star's n_i is twice as much as the other's in the same level? I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 in the same energy level. So for each star, the excitation ratio is the same as per their temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should think of the excitation as the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to those in the ground state. Let's say for star 1, this ratio is R1, and for star 2, it's R2. The problem says R1 = 2 R2. Or maybe R1 is twice R2, so R1 = 2 R
