Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that metrics in general relativity often describe the geometry of spacetime. So this metric is probably for a 2-dimensional space, as it has dx² and dy² terms.

The question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid, which is the classic example. I think the pseudosphere is an example of a surface with hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, but what's the area of a pseudosphere? I recall that for a sphere in Euclidean space, the area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is a bit different. Oh right, the pseudosphere has infinite area. Because even though it's finite in extent, its curvature is negative, leading to an infinite surface area when you integrate over it. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the metric given here is indicating something about the geometry. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks similar to the metric of a sphere with a certain radius. For a sphere, the metric is often written as something like (something)/(R² - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²), but here the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so R² would be 4, making R=2. So the radius is 2
