Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, each involving powers of r.

Hmm. Right, so I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from two points on Earth's orbit. The formula I think is that distance (r) in parsecs is inversely proportional to parallax. So, r = 1/plx. Oh wait, more accurately, plx in arcseconds is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, which implies r = 1/plx.

So if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, then substituting r into this equation would help. Since plx is 1/r, plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be r^5. Therefore, N is proportional to r^5. That would suggest that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe I need to think about the differential change, like the number per unit distance. Or perhaps it's about the number density, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, considering the volume. Or maybe it's a different approach.

Wait, let's think. The problem states that N ~ 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to plx^-5. But plx is inversely proportional to r, so plx = (1/r). So substituting, N = k * (1/( (1/r) ))^5 ) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So when considering how the number of stars changes per unit distance (like the rate of change), we can think of the derivative dN/dr. But wait, the question says "how does the number of
