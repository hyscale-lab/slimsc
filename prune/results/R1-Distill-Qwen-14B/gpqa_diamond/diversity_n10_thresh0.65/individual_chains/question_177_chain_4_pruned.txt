Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Here's what I know:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. That probably relates to their temperatures since the peak wavelength from a black body is given by Wien's law.
- The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Not sure how this affects the calculation yet, but maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting observed wavelengths or something else.
- The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, calculated using black body radiation. And the options are a bunch of numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star as a black body depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since we're looking for the ratio L1/L2, let's write that:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) )

Because the 4π and sigma cancel out in the ratio.

From the problem, R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times R2². So the radius squared part is 2.25.

Now, the temperatures. The stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If the λ_max is the same for both stars, then T1 = T2. Because if λ_max is same, T must be same. Wait, but wait! Are we talking about the intrinsic temperature or the observed temperature? Because if one star is moving towards us (high radial velocity), its light would be Doppler shifted. Oh, but the radial velocities given are 0 and 700 km/s. Wait, Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700.

Wait, that's a big point. So the observed wavelength maximum would be different if the star is moving towards or away from us. Because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same for both? That complicates things because their actual temperatures might be different.

So, for Star_1: Since radial velocity is zero, its light isn't Doppler shifted. So its observed λ_max is the same as its intrinsic λ_max. So for Star_1, λ_max1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: It has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away (since radial velocity is positive, but I think it could be either way, but probably receding if positive), which would cause redshift. So observed λ_max2
