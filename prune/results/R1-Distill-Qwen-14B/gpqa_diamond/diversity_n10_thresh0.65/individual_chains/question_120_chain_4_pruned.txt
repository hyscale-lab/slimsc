Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Right, the parallax formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So I'm thinking about the distribution of stars in the universe. Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, but I guess that's a simplification. Because in reality, the density of stars probably isn't uniform. Oh wait, no, the question says to assume they are uniformly distributed. So maybe it's more about the geometry of how their distances translate to parallax.

Let me think. If stars are uniformly distributed, that might mean that at any given distance, there are a certain number of stars. But when we talk about parallax, which is inverse of distance, how does that affect the number per unit parallax?

Suppose I have a thin shell of stars at a certain distance d. The volume of this shell is 4πd² dd, right? Because it's a sphere's surface area times a small thickness dd. So the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming uniform distribution. So N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But we want the number of stars per unit parallax, so maybe express everything in terms of plx. Since plx p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let
