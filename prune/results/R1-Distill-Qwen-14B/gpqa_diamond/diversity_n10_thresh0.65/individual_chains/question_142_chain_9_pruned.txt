Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is ½ times (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so the density matrix is a convex combination of projectors.

Wait, what's the state here? The given ρ is ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh, right, that's actually a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Each with 50% probability. So this is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. I remember that the maximally mixed state has all possible diagonal entries equal and the off-diagonal terms zero.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I recall that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point in a 3D space, with the vector (x, y, z). For a pure state |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But wait, this is for pure states. What about mixed states?

Oh, right! For density matrices, the Bloch vector (also called the purity vector) is given by a different formula. I think it's something like r = 2 Tr(ρ (σ · σ)) or something like that, but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that for a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere vectors. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.

So if ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then r·σ = 2ρ - I. Let me compute that. The identity matrix I for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So 2ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) + (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) times (1/2 * 2 )? Wait, no. Let me compute 2ρ: 2*(1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) ) = |0><0| + |1><1|. Then 2ρ - I is (|0><0| + |1><1|) - [[1,0],[0,1]]. Which is |0><0| + |1><1| - I. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them, we get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is I.
