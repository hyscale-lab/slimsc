Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then finding the average value of an operator. Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors determine the probabilities of measuring specific outcomes.

So, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional to. That probably means we need to normalize it first. Right, because the sum of the probabilities should be 1.

Let me write that down. The state is |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 = (1+i), c2 = (2 - i). But since it's proportional, we need to find the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1. So let's compute |c1| and |c2|. 

Calculating |c1|: The modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 because (1+i) has real part 1 and imaginary part 1. So |c1|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, |c2|: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So |c2|^2 is 5.

So the total squared modulus is 2 + 5 =7. Hence, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state becomes |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, or is the original state already scaled? The question says it's proportional, so we need to normalize it. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation is given by A_ij. The matrix elements are zero when i equals j, and hbar/2 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, like in spin-1/2 systems, this would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when iâ‰ j, A_ij is hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So this matrix is antisymmetric and has eigenvalues that I might
