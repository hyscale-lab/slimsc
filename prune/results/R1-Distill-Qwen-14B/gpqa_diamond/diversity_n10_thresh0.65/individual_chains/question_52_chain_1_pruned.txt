Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The problem then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. And they assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I remember from my studies that the ratio of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The equation relates the populations of two energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. Let's think about how temperature affects that ratio.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. So the temperature is lower when there are spots. 

The ratio (n2/n1) depends exponentially on the temperature. Specifically, the exponent is negative (E2-E1)/(k*T). If E2 is higher than E1, then as temperature decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number. So the exponential term decreases, making the ratio (n2/n1) smaller.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), (n2/n1) is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). So the ratio when the star is spotless (
