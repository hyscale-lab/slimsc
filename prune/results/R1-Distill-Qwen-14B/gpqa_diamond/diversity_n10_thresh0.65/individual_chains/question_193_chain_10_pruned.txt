Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A through D with different exponents.

Hmm, right. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star, and it's inversely proportional to the distance. So, the formula plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is in parsecs. So if I solve for r, it's r = 1 / plx.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars varies with distance. So they're giving N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So to find how N changes with r, I need to express N in terms of r.

Since plx = 1/r, substituting that into the equation: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5? That would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because I thought that as you look further, the number of stars you can see increases but not that rapidly. Or maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a substitution mistake. Let me think again. N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, I can write plx = k / r, where k is a constant. So N ∝ 1/( (k/r) )^5. Which is 1 * (r/(k))^5. So that's r^5 / k^5. Since k is a constant, N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. So per unit range of r, the number increases as r^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N ∝ r^5, that means the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by a factor proportional to r^5. So the correct answer would be option B) ~ r^5.

But wait, let me think again. I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars you can see decreases with distance because things get fainter. Oh, but wait, no. The number of stars you can count in a region—like, the density—might vary. Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So higher parallax (closer stars) would have more stars. But if plx is small (far away), 1/plx^5 is small, so number of stars is small. So at larger distances, plx is smaller, so 1/plx^5 is smaller. So the number of stars N would be smaller for larger r? But
