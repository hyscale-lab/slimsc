Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me first try to draw the structures in my head to understand what's happening.

Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like two carbons with a triple bond, so it's CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is actually C≡C-CH2? No, wait. Ethynyl is the substituent where the triple bond is between two carbons, so it's -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same position as the formyl group. Wait, no, the numbering might be such that the formyl is on one ring and the substituent is on another. Alternatively, perhaps it's a spiro compound or a bicyclic structure? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxymethyl)) attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group and a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached to the main cyclohexane ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is like this: there's a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group (carbaldehyde) at position 1. Then, also at position 1, there's a substituent which is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl.

So the main molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents at position 1: a formyl group and a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, that might not be possible because position 1 can only have one substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group with a hydroxymethyl group attached. So the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group.

So the target molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1 (or perhaps position 2) which is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group.

I'm a bit confused about the structure, but perhaps the synthesis steps can give me clues. Let's think about the reagents in the options and what reactions they would induce.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the first step is to functionalize the triple bond. Let's look
