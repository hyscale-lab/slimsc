Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction using 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options provided.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions often involve some kind of electrophilic addition or maybe a ring-opening. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, right? Pyrrolidine has a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. So 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me visualize that structure. The main ring is the pyrrolidine, and at the 1-position (the nitrogen?), there's a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached. Wait, cyclohexylidene implies a substituent where a double bond is formed, maybe. Oh, cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene group attached via a double bond. So the structure would have a substituent on the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine that's a methylene group connected to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, wait. Let me draw it mentally. The main ring is pyrrolidine, and at position 1 (which is the nitrogen), there's a CH2 group connected. That CH2 is then connected to a cyclohexene ring, meaning the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene. So it's like a bicyclic structure, maybe? Or perhaps the substituent is such that the cyclohexene is fused.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexylidene methyl group, which is like a vinyl cyclohexane attached via a methylene group. So the structure is the pyrrolidine with a CH2-CH2-Cyclohexene part? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

But regardless, the reaction starts with 3-methylpyrrolidine and forms this product. So what kind of reaction would do that? Since it's acid-catalyzed, perhaps an alkylation or some kind of
