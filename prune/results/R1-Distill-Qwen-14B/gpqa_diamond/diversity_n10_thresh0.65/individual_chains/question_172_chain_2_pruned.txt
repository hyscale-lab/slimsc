Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I need to figure out the relationship between their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are, right? So if star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms, its temperature must be higher than star_2's.

But how exactly does the excitation relate to temperature? Oh, right! It's the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor determines the population of different energy levels. The formula is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy states.

The Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the population in the excited state (let's say i) compared to the ground state (j) is higher.

So for star_1, n_i1 / n_j1 = 2, and for star_2, n_i2 / n_j2 = 1, maybe? Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe the excitation state is n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2's. So n_i1 = 2 * n_i2, or perhaps n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2)? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Or wait, no, it says the atoms are twice as excited. Oh, perhaps the excitation level is twice—so the ratio of excited to ground state is higher. So for star_1, n_i1/n_j1 = 2*(n_i2/n_j2). Or maybe
