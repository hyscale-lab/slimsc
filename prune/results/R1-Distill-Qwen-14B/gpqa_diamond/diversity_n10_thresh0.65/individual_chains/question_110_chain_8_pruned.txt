Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both these spectrographs are high-resolution ones. But the key here is their limiting magnitudes. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning up to 17 mag or lower. While HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter (lower magnitude) than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and any brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES.

Wait, but I need to be careful because apparent magnitude is what matters for detection. Absolute magnitude is how bright they are intrinsically, but if they're far away, their apparent magnitude would be fainter. So I need to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star.

Let me look at each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5 mag, distance 10 pc. Oh wait, the absolute magnitude (M) is defined at 10 pc. So if it's located at 10 pc, then the apparent magnitude (m) is the same as the absolute magnitude. So m = 15.5 mag. Now, can ESPRESSO and HIRES detect it?

ESPRESSO goes up to 17, so 15.5 is below that. So yes, ESPRESSO can see it. HIRES
