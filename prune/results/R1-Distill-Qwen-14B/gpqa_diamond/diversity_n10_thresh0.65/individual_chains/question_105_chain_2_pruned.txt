Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around what's being asked. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how they mimic the light curve of an exoplanet. Interesting. So the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Photometric observations will show brightness variations due to the star's rotation. But if the star wasn't spotted, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness change?

Wait, so the question is asking for the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius. The options are A to D, with some decimal numbers. So I need to find Rpl (planet radius) divided by Rstar.

Let me think. When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is delta F = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 times some factor. But wait, in this case, the spots on the star are causing a similar dip in brightness as a planet would. So I need to model the dip caused by the spots and then find what planet size would cause the same dip.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The problem says that the situation (with spots) can resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness variation due to the spots is like the planet's transit. So we need to calculate the equivalent Rpl/Rstar to get the same amplitude.

But the star's spots are causing
