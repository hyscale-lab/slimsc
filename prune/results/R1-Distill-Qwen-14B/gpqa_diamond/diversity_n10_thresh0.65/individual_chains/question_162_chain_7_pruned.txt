Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. So, this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because the line element only involves dx and dy. So we're dealing with a 2D space here.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait, pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic plane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the term here is used in the context of a metric with negative curvature.

Wait, no, the question says pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps it's a 2-dimensional surface with constant curvature, but negative. So, the area of a pseudosphere in 2D would be like the area of a sphere but with a different formula because of the negative curvature.

Wait, the area of a sphere in 2D is 4πr², right? But for a pseudosphere, which is a hyperbolic space, the area is different. Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (or a 'pseudosphere') is actually infinite because hyperbolic space is unbounded. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's get back to the metric. Let me write it down:

ds² = [
