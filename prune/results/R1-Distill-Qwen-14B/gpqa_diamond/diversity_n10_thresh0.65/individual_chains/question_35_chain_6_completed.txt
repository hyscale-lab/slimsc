Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y. Let me read the problem again carefully.

So, A_y is represented as a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar—like the Pauli matrices. Oh right, Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 systems, so this makes sense since a muon has spin 1/2.

The eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, I have to look at the options and see which statement is correct.

First, let's write out the matrix A_y. Since c is h/(4π), and S is given, then A_y = c * S. So let me compute that matrix.

S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So multiplying each element by c, which is h/(4π), gives A_y as:
[ 0      (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ (i)(h/(4π))   0 ]

Wait, but another approach might be to note that the Pauli matrices (like S here) are often written as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each scaled by ħ in some contexts. Wait, but in this case, A is being treated as the operator, which for spin-1/2 particles is usually S = ħ/2 * σ, where σ is the Pauli matrices. Wait, but in this problem, A is given as c * S where c is h/(4π). Let me clarify the units.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 2π times ħ. So h = 2πħ. So c is h/(4π) which is (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c equals ħ/2. So A_y = (ħ/2) * S. Wait, but S is given as the matrix with 0 and i terms. So S must be the Pauli matrix σ_y, perhaps?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually defined as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. For σ_y, the matrix is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So S must be σ_y. So A_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. So A_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y.

So the eigenvalues of A_y would be the eigenvalues of (ħ/2) σ_y. The eigenvalues of σ_y are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A_y should be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. But wait, let me check. Because eigenvalues of σ matrices are ±1, so when multiplied by a scalar, they'll just be scaled.

Wait, but the options don't directly give this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't seem right because I think the eigenvalues are real here. Because A_y is a Hermitian operator? Wait, angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so yes. So their eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but wait. The matrix A_y might not be Hermitian. Wait, let me check. S is σ_y, which is Hermitian because its complex conjugate transpose is itself. Let's see: the σ_y matrix is [0, -i; i, 0]. The transpose is [0, i; -i, 0], and the complex conjugate would be [0, i; -i, 0], which is not the same as the original. Oh wait, no—wait, the conjugate transpose (dagger) would be [0, i; -i, 0], which is not equal to σ_y. So σ_y is anti-Hermitian? Or wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, σ_y is Hermitian. Because σ_y dagger is σ_y. Let me compute the conjugate transpose of σ_y:

σ_y is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0.

Conjugate transpose (swap rows and columns and take complex conjugate):

Column 1 becomes row 1: 0, i.

Column 2 becomes row 2: -i, 0.

So the conjugate transpose is:

[ 0   i ]

[ -i  0 ]

Which is not the same as σ_y. Wait, that's σ_y dagger equals i σ_y? Not sure. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps σ_y is anti-Hermitian. Because σ_y dagger is -σ_y. Let me check:

σ_y dagger is [0 i; -i 0], which is -σ_y because σ_y is [0 -i; i 0], so -σ_y is [0 i; -i 0]. Yes, that's correct. So σ_y dagger = -σ_y, so σ_y is anti-Hermitian. So S is anti-Hermitian, which makes A_y = (ħ/2) S also anti-Hermitian. Wait, but angular momentum operators are supposed to be Hermitian because they have real eigenvalues. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the conventions. Let me think again. The spin operator S for a spin-½ particle is (ħ/2) σ. So S is a Hermitian operator. So S is (ħ/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix, which is Hermitian. So each Pauli matrix, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, is Hermitian. So σ_y is Hermitian. So why did I think earlier that σ_y dagger is -σ_y? Let me recompute σ_y dagger.

σ_y is [0, -i; i, 0]. The conjugate transpose (dagger) would be:

Take the transpose, which swaps rows and columns. So the transpose is [0 i; -i 0]. Then take the complex conjugate of each element. The elements are 0, i, -i, 0. The conjugates would be 0, -i, i, 0. So the dagger is [0 -i; i 0], which is equal to σ_y. So σ_y is Hermitian. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. So σ_y is Hermitian. So A_y, being (ħ/2) σ_y, is Hermitian as well.

So A_y is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but the options given don't show all real parts. Let's look again.

Option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But since the eigenvalues are real, the imaginary part must be zero. So that can't be the case. So option B is incorrect.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or –2πh, and the real parts are ±h/(4π). But h is Planck's constant, which is a real number, but the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts would be zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. Well, A is the angular momentum operator, so A² would have eigenvalues a(a+1)ħ² for spin a. But wait, A is the y-component operator. The eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenstates of S_y. But for a spin-½ system, the eigenfunctions of S_y are orthogonal to those of S_z, but I'm not sure about being eigenfunctions of A². Wait, A² is the square of the total angular momentum. For a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalues of A² would be (½)(½+1)ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, then it's also an eigenfunction of A², because A² commutes with all components of A. So option C says the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Wait, but if the system has definite A_y, does it have definite A_z? No, because in quantum mechanics, knowing the y-component doesn't fix the z-component. So, the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of A_y are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that. The basis functions are usually the eigenfunctions of the operator because the operator can be diagonal in its eigenbasis. So if the matrix is 2x2, the eigenfunctions would form a basis for the vector space. So D's statement is correct as well. But I need to think more.

Wait, but what's the correct answer? Let me re-approach this.

The problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

So first, let's compute the eigenvalues of A_y.

A_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So σ_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So A_y's eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are real. So options A and B, which involve imaginary parts, are incorrect.

Now, looking at option C: the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is a Casimir operator and commutes with all components. So any eigenstate of Ay should also be an eigenstate of A². So the first part of option C is correct.

As for Az, the z-component angular momentum operator, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0. So the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That makes sense because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but option C and D both could be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, any matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space. So option D is correct.

Wait, but I thought option C was correct as well. So which option is correct based on the question.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me see all the options again.

So the question is which statement is correct. Let's see:

Option C: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That seems correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also eigenstate of A². But they can't be eigenstates of Az, since Ay and Az don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, especially since the matrix is 2x2 and has two linearly independent eigenvectors (since it's diagonalizable, as it's Hermitian).

Wait, but looking at the options, which one is correct as per the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors explicitly.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions, but let me think: the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors will form a basis for the 2D space. So option D is correct.

But wait, the options only let me choose one correct statement.

Wait, looking back at the problem, the options are given, and I have to choose which is correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Both statements could be correct, but I need to see which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's think about option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's always true because any diagonalizable matrix can be expressed in its eigenbasis. So the eigenvectors form a basis, yes.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Hmm, perhaps the correct statement is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, let me look again at the eigenvalues.

A_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, so eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are out.

Now, when I compute the eigenvectors, they will be the same as the eigenvectors of σ_y. Since σ_y has eigenvectors proportional to (1, i) and (1, -i), I think.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvectors for σ_y.

For eigenvalue +1: (σ_y - I) v = 0.

σ_y - I is [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

Looking for non-trivial solutions:

- The first equation: -v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T, which can be written as (1, i) if we factor out i.

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1: (σ_y + I) v =0 → [[1, -i], [-i, 1]] v=0.

First equation: v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

So eigenvector proportional to (i, 1), which can be written as (1, -i).

So the eigenvectors are (1, i) and (1, -i) for eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively, when multiplied by σ_y.

But since A_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, the eigenvectors remain the same, only the eigenvalues are scaled.

So the eigenfunctions are these vectors, which form an orthonormal basis for the 2D space.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space on which the operator acts. So D is correct.

Wait, but option C also says something correct. Let me think again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for a spin-½ particle is ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So any eigenstate of Ay must also be an eigenstate of A² because A² commutes with Ay. So the first part of option C is correct.

As for Az, since [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax (from angular momentum commutation relations), which is non-zero, so the eigenstates of Ay cannot be eigenstates of Az. So the second part of option C is correct. So option C's statement is correct.

So both options C and D could be correct. But wait, looking back, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of these is a correct statement.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, the eigenvectors are the basis functions. So D is correct.

So if both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, but the problem gives only one correct option. So let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps option C is incorrect. Because, in reality, the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct. So option C is correct.

But wait, the problem is about the calculation during which statement is considered. So perhaps more than one is correct, but only one of the options is correct.

Wait, looking at the options, let me reevaluate.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

But actually, I think for spin systems, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with all components, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So the first part is correct.

So which option is correct.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

But in the options, I can't select more than one. So perhaps I should go back.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of Az. No, that's impossible because they don't commute. So option C is correct.

Wait, but in any case, I need to select one.

Another approach: Let me calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

A_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

The eigenvectors for σ_y are (1, i) and (1, -i). So the eigenvectors of A_y are the same.

So the eigenfunctions form a basis. So option D is correct.

But option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the question is testing whether the eigenvalues are real, which they are, so options A and B are out. So between C and D.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct because any diagonalizable matrix has its eigenvectors as the basis.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question, so I have to choose the correct option.

Wait, another thought: the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So option C is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's also correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but since the options are given, I must choose the correct one.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: it says during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So perhaps the correct choice is C, because the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², and cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. But I'm not entirely sure because D also seems correct.

Wait, but here's another angle: the matrix operator is 2x2, so it's defined in a 2D space. The eigenfunctions form a basis for that space, so D is correct.

But perhaps the question is about the eigenfunctions being the same as the basis. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Wait, but let me think about the physics. For a spin-½ particle, the state with definite S_y has an undefined S_z. So the eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z. So option C is correct.

But I'm not sure why option D is incorrect. It's saying the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That should be correct.

Wait, perhaps D is correct because the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach: the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² because A² commutes with Ay. So yes, option C is correct.

But option D is also correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But perhaps in the options, only one is correct. Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap.

The eigenvalues of Ay are ±ħ/2. So options A and B are out.

So the correct statements are about the eigenvectors and their properties.

Option C: eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Correct.

But perhaps the only correct statement is C.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to find which option is correct.

Wait, the problem is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because any diagonalizable matrix can be written in its eigenbasis. So D is correct.

But the question is about the calculation, which of the statements is correct. So perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, the question could be about whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions. So perhaps D is correct.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the statement in D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because any matrix can be diagonalized in its eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space on which the operator acts. So D is correct.

But the problem is that both C and D could be correct, but perhaps only one is.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not sure. I think I've spent too much time on this. Let me try to decide.

Given that each spin component's eigenfunctions are orthogonal to other components, but share the same space, and that eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, option C is correct.

So I'll go with option C as the correct answer.


The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix. The matrix \( S \) is identified as the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), which has the form:

\[
S = \sigma_y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \). The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_y \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). These eigenvalues are real, as \( A_y \) is a Hermitian operator.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \)), with no imaginary components.

2. **Option B**: Claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real and given by \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of the \( z \)-component \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space on which the operator acts.

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement "during the calculation," option C is the more relevant choice because it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to the eigenvalue problem. Option D is a general statement about the basis of the operator, which is true but less specific to the calculation.

**Answer: C**
