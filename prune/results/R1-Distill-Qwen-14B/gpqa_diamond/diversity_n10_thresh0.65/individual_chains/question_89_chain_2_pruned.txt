Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Heating with KOH probably leads to a double elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming an allene or maybe a diene? Hmm, wait, no. If it's 1,3-dibromo, elimination would give a diene if each bromine is on adjacent carbons, but adamantane's structure might influence that.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on two non-adjacent (but across) positions. When KOH is used, each Br may undergo elimination. But since there are two Brs, perhaps two E2 eliminations occur, each removing a Br and an H, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, in vicinal dihalides, elimination would form an alk
