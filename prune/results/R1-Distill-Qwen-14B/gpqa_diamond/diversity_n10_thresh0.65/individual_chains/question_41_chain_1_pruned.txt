Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, so the glass is moving toward the observer, same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving in the same direction as the light. Oh, but the observer is in the lab, so the glass's movement will affect how we perceive the speed of light in it.

I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, the speed of light within that medium doesn't just add up vectorially with the medium's velocity. Because that's not how light works. Light always travels at c in a vacuum, but when it's in a medium, its speed is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index.

But wait, this is a scenario where the medium (glass) is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light in the medium?

Let me think about frame of references. The glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. The light within the glass has a speed of v_light = c/n in the glass's
