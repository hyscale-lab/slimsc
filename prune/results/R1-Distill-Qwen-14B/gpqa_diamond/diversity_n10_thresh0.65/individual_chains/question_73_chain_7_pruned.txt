Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I have to use special relativity. 

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me break this down. First, finding the relative speed. I think in relativity, the relative velocity isn't just the difference between their speeds. Oh right, you can't just subtract them because that would give a speed higher than c, which isn't possible. So I need to use the velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)) when v is the velocity of the frame. But in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed should be the difference divided by that factor. Let me get it right.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. From A's perspective, what is B's speed? Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, the question is about the relative speed. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.3c² / c²) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So
