Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances relate to the structure of the crystal lattice, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the lattice parameter 'a' is the interatomic distance, which is given as 10 Angstrom. And the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. So it's a rhombohedral lattice with a=10 Å and angles of 30 degrees.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... some terms involving the cosines of the angles... ) Maybe it's the same as the formula for hexagonal lattices, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system maybe? Or maybe it's a separate system. The formula I remember is for cubic systems, but rhombohedral has non-right angles.

Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by 1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin²α)) + (k²/b²)(1/(sin²β)) + (l²/c²)(1/(sin²γ)) ) minus some cross
