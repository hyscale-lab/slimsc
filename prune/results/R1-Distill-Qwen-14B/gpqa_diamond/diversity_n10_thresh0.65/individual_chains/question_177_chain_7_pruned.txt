Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation.

Then there's something about radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, how does that affect luminosity? Hmm, maybe not directly. Oh wait, no, luminosity is an intrinsic property, not depending on motion. So the velocities might not affect the calculation, unless maybe for Doppler shift affecting observed wavelengths—but wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the peak wavelengths are the same when observed, but we need to account for any Doppler shifts.

Wait, but the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies. So their luminosity would depend on their radius and temperature, right? The luminosity formula for a star as a blackbody is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. Blackbody radiation has a peak wavelength given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So, if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same? Wait, but only if there's no redshift or blueshift due to their velocities.

Wait, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but which direction? If it's moving towards or away from us, that would cause a shift in the observed wavelength. But the problem says the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So Star_2's peak wavelength is shifted, but the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1's.

Wait
