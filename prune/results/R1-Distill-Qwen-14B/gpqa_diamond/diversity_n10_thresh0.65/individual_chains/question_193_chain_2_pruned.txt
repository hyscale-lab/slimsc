Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about how the number of stars in a region varies with distance. From what I remember, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, or N ∝ (1/plx)^5? Hmm, I think it's the former, N is proportional to 1 divided by plx to the fifth power. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Wait no, wait, the question says it varies as 1/plx^5. So if N ∝ 1/plx^5, that's the same as N ∝ plx^(-5).

But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, plx = d, where d is distance. Oh wait, no, more precisely, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 / (distance in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs.

So plx is inversely proportional to d. So if I have plx = 1/d, then substituting into the expression for N, which is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

So plx = 1/d, so 1/(plx) would be d.
