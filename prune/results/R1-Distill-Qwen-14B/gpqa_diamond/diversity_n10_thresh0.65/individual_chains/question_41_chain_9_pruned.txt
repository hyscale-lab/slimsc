Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, waitâ€”speed of light in the glass? Normally, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of light inside it?

Oh right, special relativity comes into play here, I think. Because when the medium is moving, light's speed isn't simply additive with the medium's velocity. Because according to Einstein, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer.

But wait, the glass isn't in a vacuum. It's a medium with index n. So how does that work? Hmm.

Wait, the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. But is that speed measured in the medium's rest frame or the lab frame (observer's frame)? Because if the medium itself is moving, then to the lab frame, the speed of light might be different.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So how do we calculate the light's speed in the lab frame?

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n, but that's the speed in the medium's rest frame. When the medium is moving at velocity u, then the speed in the lab frame would be v_medium + v_in_medium, but wait, that's only for non-relativistic speeds. Oh wait, but when dealing with light, relativistic effects are significant.

Wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the problem again.

So, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass towards the observer. So in the rest frame of the glass, the
