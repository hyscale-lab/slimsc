Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry and which one has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is all about the different types of symmetry elements they possess. C3h symmetry... wait, what does that mean again? Oh right, the C3h point group includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and the combination of these can generate other elements like C3^2, σv, σv', etc.

So the question lists four molecules, and the options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Let me look at each molecule one by one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I think triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3B, right? It's a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure is trigonal pyramidal, similar to ammonia. Wait, ammonia has a trigonal pyramidal shape with C3v symmetry. But triisopropyl borate... if the substituents are all the same, like three identical isopropyl groups, then the symmetry might be higher. Oh wait, no, because the molecule is trigonal pyramidal, the symmetry would still be C3v, not C3h. Because C3h requires a horizontal mirror plane. So maybe this molecule doesn't have C3h.

Next is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, right? It's a norbornane derivative. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, which has a bridge. I think quinuclidine has a chair-like structure. Wait, what's its symmetry? I remember that norbornane has C2v symmetry, but quinuclidine might have higher symmetry. Oh wait, I think quinuclidine is actually a tricyclic structure. Hmm, no, I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Quinuclidine has a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. The molecule is symmetric with a plane of symmetry; maybe it's C2h symmetry or something else. Alternatively, if it's similar to norbornane, which has a C2 axis and some mirror planes. But wait, C3h symmetry would require a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. Hmm, I'm not sure about quinuclidine's symmetry here. I might need to think more.

Third option
