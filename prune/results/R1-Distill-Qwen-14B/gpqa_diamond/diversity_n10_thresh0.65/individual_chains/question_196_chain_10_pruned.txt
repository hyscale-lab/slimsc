Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic setting. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force follows Hooke's law, F = -kx. And we're supposed to consider the speed of light c in our calculations.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the options here are about relativistic cases, so I can't just stick with the classical result.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So we need to use the relativistic expressions for energy.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is then E - mc² = (gamma - 1)mc².

In the case of the harmonic oscillator, at maximum amplitude A, all the energy should be potential, and at maximum speed, all energy is kinetic. Wait no, wait. Actually, in the relativistic case, the energy isn't just kinetic and potential like in the classical case. Because the potential energy (
