Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, there's something about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay, so the key points are:

1. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. Not sure if that's relevant here, but maybe it's about the star's structure or something. I'll keep it in mind.

2. No spots: Teff=6000 K. 40% spots: Teff=5500 K. Wait, but starspots are cooler regions, right? So when spots are present, the observed Teff would be lower. But wait, the star's actual Teff without spots is 6000 K, but when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, how does that work? Oh, wait, no. Wait, the Teff when spots are present is lower because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the overall star's flux is a mix of the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Oh, wait, perhaps I should model the star as having two regions: the spotted and the unspotted. When 40% of the surface is covered, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere (so, the combined effect) is 5500 K. But wait, that might not be the case. Maybe the Teff is a blackbody-weighted average? Because the flux from each region contributes to the total.

Wait, but let's think about it. The effective temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same total flux as the star. So the star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions. So the effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity and the surface area.

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So when part of the surface is at a lower temperature, the total luminosity would be:

L_total = L_unspotted + L_spotted.

So L_unspotted is the area of the unspotted part (60% of the surface) times the flux from that region, which is σ*Teff_unspot^4. Similarly for the spotted part.

Wait, but in this problem, when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, that's confusing. Because the Teff is a measure of the total flux. So what's actually happening is that the star's average flux is lower because a significant fraction of its surface is emitting less flux due to the spots.

Wait, but the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the observed Teff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K.

But I'm not sure if the question is about the star's average Teff or the Teff of the unspotted regions. Because in reality, the spots are cooler, so the unspotted regions would be hotter than the average. But the problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

So, I think I need to model this as the observed Teff being a combination of the areas. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of spots lowers the average temperature, so the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But wait, the problem states that when the star's surface isn't covered, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. So okay, the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered.

Wait, but that can't be right because the presence of spots would make the star appear cooler. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the observed flux is lower.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I can model the problem in terms of the observed flux and the individual flux contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the ionization state of Ti in the photosphere. So the ratio of neutral Ti in two energy levels depends on the temperature.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Without spots, it's higher, so we're looking for a factor by which the ratio increases when there are no spots compared to when there are.

Wait, the question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So, when it's spotless (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher than when it has spots (T=5500 K). So the factor is (ratio when no spots) / (ratio when spots present).

What affects the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels? Oh, that's the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since the transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the UV range. Let me think, but I don't think the wavelength is directly needed unless it's for calculating the energy difference.

Wait, 1448 Å is about 1448 Angstroms, which is 144.8 nm. That's in the extreme ultraviolet range. So the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/(λ). Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448e-10 meters. So E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV. Hmm, that's a big energy difference. So E2 - E1 is about 8.56 eV.

Wait, but when the temperature changes, the ratio n1/n2 will change. Let me think about the Boltzmann factor. The ratio is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, this exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Because (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative, and when T decreases, the denominator is smaller, so the exponent is more negative → exp becomes smaller.

Wait, if the exponent is negative, a higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the exponential is larger. So for higher T, the ratio n1/n2 is higher. Because when T increases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases (since ΔE/(kT) decreases, so the negative is less negative, so the exponent is higher).

So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which matches the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So, the question is to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K).

So, the ratio when no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K.

The ratio when spots are present is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), where T2 is 5500 K.

So the factor is R1 / R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you factor out, you get R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me see:

R1/R2 = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because T2 is 5500 and T1 is 6000, so 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So (1/T2 -1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive, so exp is positive. So R1/R2 is greater than 1, which makes sense because the ratio without spots is higher.

So, now I need to calculate this exponent.

We have ΔE = 8.56 eV. But we need to compute this in terms of Joules for the Boltzmann constant. Alternatively, perhaps we can use eV and the appropriate constants.

The Boltzmann constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, let me compute ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ let's calculate that.

Wait, 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 8.56 * 11604 ≈ let's compute 8 *11604=92,832, 0.56*11604≈6500, so total about 99,332 K.

Wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me be more precise.

8.56 / 0.00008617 = 8.56 / 8.617e-5.

Let me compute 8.56 / 8.617e-5:

= (8.56) / (8.617 * 1e-5 )

≈ (8.56 / 8.617) ) * 1e5.

8.56 /8.617 ≈ approximately 0.993.

So 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99,300 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,300 K.

Now, compute (1/T2 -1/T1) where T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

So 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1.

Difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

So, the exponent is (99,300 K) * (0.000015151 K^-1 ) ≈ 99,300 * 0.000015151.

Let's compute that:

99,300 * 0.000015151 = ?

Well, 1e5 * 0.000015151 is 1.5151, so 99,300 is about 0.993e5, so 0.993e5 * 0.000015151 ≈ 0.993 * 1.5151 ≈ approximately 1.505.

Wait, 1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151, so 99300 is 0.993 * 1e5 → 0.993 * 1.5151 ≈ 1.505.

So, the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So, R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

What's e^1.5? e is about 2.71828.

e^1=2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

But 1.505 is slightly more than 1.5, so maybe e^1.505 ≈ 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me calculate e^1.505 more accurately. Let me compute ln(4.5)= ~1.504. Oh wait, that's interesting.

Because ln(4.5) is approximately 1.5040774. So e^1.5040774 is 4.5 exactly.

So, in our case, the exponent is approximately 1.505, which is just a little over. So e^1.505 is just a bit over 4.5. So the factor is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \)
The transition wavelength is given as \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \Delta E / k \)
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \)
The temperatures are \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 \approx 0.00001518 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the exponent
The exponent is:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (99,300) \cdot (0.00001518) \approx 1.505.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star does not have spots compared to when it does.
