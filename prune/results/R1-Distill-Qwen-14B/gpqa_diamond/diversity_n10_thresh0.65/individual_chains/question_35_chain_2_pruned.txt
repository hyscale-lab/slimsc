Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator. It's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often represented by these kinds of matrices. The Pauli matrices come to mind. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used for spin-1/2 particles. Let me think about S. The given matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Hmm, that doesn't look exactly like the standard Pauli matrices. Wait, the standard Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are:

σx = [ [0,1], [1,0] ]
σy = [ [0,-i], [i,0] ]
σz = [ [1,0], [0,-1] ]

Oh wait, so S here is exactly like σy. Because the given S is [0 -i; i 0], which matches σy. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

So Ay is c times σy. Since c is h/(4π), let's write that down: Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So we need to find the eigenvalues a and eigenvectors φ of Ay.

But wait, σy is a Hermitian matrix, right? Because all Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So σy is Hermitian because its conjugate transpose is the same as itself. Because the elements are real except for the i's, which are in positions that would make the transpose have the same as the original when conjugated.

Wait, let me check. The conjugate transpose of σy is:

Take the transpose of σy, which swaps the off-diagonal elements. The original is [0, -i; i, 0]. Transposing gives [0, i; -i, 0]. Then take the complex conjugate of each element: 0 stays 0, -i becomes i, i becomes -i, 0 stays 0. So the conjugate transpose is [0, -i; i, 0], which is the same as σy. So yes, σy is Hermitian. That means its eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but wait a minute. That can't be right because σy has complex entries. But Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues regardless. So the eigenvalues of σy should be real. But wait, let me think again: no, wait, σy is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real. So when we multiply by c, which is a real scalar, the eigenvalues will be c multiplied by those real eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of σy? The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy would have eigenvalues a = (h/(4π)) * 1 and a = (h/(4π)) * (-1). So a would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real. Wait, but the question options are talking about the imaginary parts, which is confusing. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π). But that can't be right because as I thought, the eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be real, meaning their imaginary parts are zero.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Doesn't fit with what I'm thinking.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A
