Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. Hmm, wait, what's C3H symmetry? I remember that in point groups, C3 is a three-fold rotation axis, and H means it has a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe H is for a horizontal mirror plane that's not passing through the same point as the axis? I'm a bit confused about the exact notation.

Wait, let's recap. The point group designations involve letters like C, D, O, T, etc., and superscripts like h, v, s. Oh right, the h stands for horizontal. So a molecule with C3h symmetry should have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That sounds like a complex structure with multiple rings. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound, and the rest is a trifuran attached in some way. I'm not exactly sure about the symmetry here. Maybe the molecule has multiple benzene rings connected to a central structure, which might have some symmetry.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Another complex structure. The benzo part suggests a benzene ring fused with something else. The trifuran implies three furan rings connected. Hmm, not sure about the symmetry here.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Wait, that's [(i-Pr)3B]–O–R? No, wait, triisopropyl borate would be B(OiPr)3. So the borate ion is [B(OiPr)3]^-. The molecule would be the conjugate acid, maybe. Alternatively, as a neutral molecule? Wait, I'm not sure. But the structure would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. So each of the three substituents is identical. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry around B. So the central boron is connected to three identical groups. So the symmetry here would be... Well, for a molecule like boron with three identical substituents and a central atom, the symmetry could be tetrahedral? Wait, but in this case, the borate might have a planar structure. Wait, no, the borate ion [BO3]^3- is trigonal planar. So if it's [B(OiPr)3]^-, the molecule might have C3v symmetry because each substituent is the same. Oh wait, C3v has a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes. But the question is about C3h. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's C3h if it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not sure about the substituents. Wait, each isopropyl group is symmetric itself, but when you have three identical groups arranged around a central point, the symmetry could have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis, making it h symmetry.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, a norbornane derivative. I think quinuclidine has a C7 symmetry or something else. Wait, no, wait. Quinuclidine is a molecule with a bridge structure, so it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure has a seven-membered ring but with bridges. I'm trying to recall its symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis. Because the molecule is symmetric; each bridge is equivalent. So, maybe it has a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it has a C3 axis but no horizontal mirror plane, making it C3v or something else.

Wait, I should think about each option's structure.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. So the structure is B with three OiPr groups. Each iPr is the same. So the molecule is symmetric around the B atom. If you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. So that's a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis, cutting through the molecule. So for each iPr group, if the mirror plane is horizontal (like cutting through the plane of the B-O bonds), then the mirror image would look the same. But in this case, the iPr groups are in a trigonal planar arrangement. So each is a substituted group. Wait, but each iPr is symmetric on its own. So the overall molecule would have C3h symmetry because the rotation and the mirror plane both apply.

Wait, but wait. The mirror plane in C3h is horizontal, which is a plane that's perpendicular to the main rotation axis. So, for a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror plane would be in the plane of the substituents. Wait, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is through the boron and one of the substituents. No, that would be a vertical plane. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry. Since all three substituents are the same, the point group would be D3h or something similar. Wait, D3h has a three-fold axis, mirror planes, and inversion. Hmm. Or perhaps it's just C3v, which has a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes. So maybe it's not C3h.

Wait, but the question is about C3h. So I'm a bit confused now.

Option D: Quinuclidine. It's a structure with a bridge. Let's think about the symmetry. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, as the bridges are arranged symmetrically. Also, I think it has a horizontal mirror plane. Because if you imagine cutting it through the middle, the top and bottom parts are mirror images. So that would make it C3h.

Wait, no, wait. Quinuclidine's structure is like two pyramids connected by a bridge. Wait, perhaps it's a tricyclic compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclo with three bridges. The actual structure of quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which means it's a cube-like structure (though not a cube). The molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation that goes through the center and passes through the three bridgeheads. So rotating 120 degrees would cycle the three bridges. And a horizontal mirror plane would cut the molecule into two mirror halves. So yes, that would make it have C3h symmetry.

But wait, another thought: quinuclidine is also a chiral molecule, isn't it? No, wait, no. Quinuclidine is not chiral; it's actually a meso compound. Because it has a plane of symmetry. So if it's a meso compound, it would have a mirror plane. So the mirror plane would be in the center, perpendicular to the three-fold axis. That would make the point group C3h.

Wait, but I'm not totally sure about whether quinuclidine is meso. Let me try to visualize it. The structure has three bridges, each of two carbons. The molecule is symmetric. So perhaps the mirror plane is along the three-fold axis, but perpendicular to it. If that's the case, then the molecule would have a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h.

Alternatively, maybe it's D3h? No, because D3h has more symmetry elements. I think quinuclidine is C3h.

Now, looking at the other options. Let's see.

Option A: Triphenyleno something. Triphenylene has a three-fold symmetry, I believe. The molecule is like three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way. So in triphenylene, the structure is symmetric with a three-fold axis. If the substituents (like the trifuran parts) are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule might have C3h symmetry. But wait, the name is something about trifuran with substituents at different positions. I'm not sure if the overall structure has a horizontal mirror plane.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The benzo part is a benzene ring fused with something. The 'trifuran' suggests three furan rings connected in a certain way. Not sure about the symmetry here. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold axis, but I'm not certain about a horizontal mirror plane.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. As I thought before, the three identical substituents around boron suggest a C3 axis, but whether a horizontal mirror plane exists depends on the structure. If the mirror plane is in the plane of the boron and the oxygens, then the substituents (iPr) would have their planes aligned, but each iPr is symmetric. So perhaps this molecule has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, maybe another approach: which of these compounds is known to have C3h symmetry?

Quinuclidine is known to have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So it's C3h. On the other hand, triisopropyl borate, which is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical groups, would have D3h symmetry, perhaps. Because D3h has a higher symmetry, with more mirror planes and inversion. Or maybe it's just C3v. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, correction: the borate ion is [B(OiPr)3]^−. Boron is sp² hybridized, so trigonal planar. Each OiPr group is the same. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis, and three vertical mirror planes (each passing through a B-O and the midpoint of the opposite OiPr groups). So that would make the point group D3h. Or perhaps C3v.

Wait, D3h has a three-fold axis, three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. So if triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane, it would be D3h. But perhaps it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is in the C3v point group because it has a three-fold axis and three vertical mirror planes but no horizontal mirror plane.

So if the question is about C3h symmetry, which requires a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then triisopropyl borate may not have that. But quinuclidine does.

Wait, but wait another point. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a three-fold axis. If you imagine rotating it 120 degrees, the structure looks the same. Also, it has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to this axis, which is a horizontal mirror plane. So that makes it C3h.

So putting it all together:

Option D (quinuclidine) has C3h symmetry. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A, B, C, D, and the choices are the four molecules.

Wait, the first part of the question lists four molecules, and the options are A to D, each being one of them. So the question is, which of the molecules (the four given) has C3h symmetry.

The answer is option D: quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) that is perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a complex structure with three benzene rings fused to a central trifuran system. While it has a three-fold rotation axis due to the symmetric arrangement of the benzene rings, it does not appear to have a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule consists of a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The structure is symmetric, but it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) but does not have a horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it belongs to the **C₃v** point group, which includes vertical mirror planes but no horizontal mirror plane. Hence, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) that is perpendicular to the rotation axis. This combination of symmetry elements makes quinuclidine a molecule with **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the molecule with **C₃h** symmetry is **quinuclidine**.
