Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are like infinities that pop up in calculations and are physically nonsensical. So without regularization, these theories would give us answers that don't make sense, like infinite charges or masses.

Wait, but some theories might not need regularization because they're already finite. I think that's the case for certain theories. So which of these options don't have these divergences?

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? It's supposed to be a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. But wait, string theory requires a lot of mathematical machinery. I think string theory avoids some of the usual divergences because it's a theory of strings rather than point particles. Or maybe because it works in higher dimensions. I'm not entirely sure, but I think string theory does require regularization in some contexts, but perhaps it's not necessary in the same way as other theories. Or maybe it doesn't require it at all because it's inherently finite? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to quantum Yang-Mills. I remember that in QCD, there's a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies (or short distances). But wait, does QCD require regularization? I think it does because, like most quantum field theories, it has loop divergences. So you need to regularize it, perhaps using methods like lattice regularization or cutoff regularization. So B would require regularization and thus isn't the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is the first quantum field theory that was developed. It's a U(1) gauge theory. I remember learning that QED does have divergences, like the electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. These lead to issues like the infinite charge of the
