Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. So, the question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. It's being reacted with a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting material. The NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet integrating to one proton. A triplet at around 9.7 ppm suggests it's an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde group. Or could it be an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid? No, because the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, so molecular formula has one N and one O. Let's see: C8H9NO. So the degree of unsaturation would be calculated. Each degree is a ring or a double bond.

Calculating degree of unsaturation: For C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X (halogens) is 0, so:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturationâ€”so maybe one ring and four double bonds, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) and a double bond (1) plus another ring or double bond? Hmm.

Looking back at the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm: I think it's an aldehyde H. But wait, in aromatic aldehydes, the aldehyde proton is usually around 9.5-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aromatic ring with an aldehyde group attached. Let me think about the other peaks.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's a doublet with two protons. Maybe part of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So if the substituents are in para positions, each set of protons would give a
