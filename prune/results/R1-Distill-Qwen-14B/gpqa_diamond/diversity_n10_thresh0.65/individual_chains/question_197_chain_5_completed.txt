Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of an ester or maybe an acid chloride. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used for the conversion of nitriles to amines, but wait, no, that's with HCl. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, when you have an ester, you can hydrolyze it under acidic or basic conditions. Red phosphorus might be involved in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, especially with HI acting as an acid. Or wait, maybe it's about the elimination reaction?

Wait, let's get back. First, let's figure out what compound X is.

The IR data is given as:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: That's a broad peak, probably O-H or N-H stretching. Since it's in that range, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or an amine. But looking at the NMR data, I don't see any obvious amine protons. Let me check the NMR.

The NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty high shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10. Or maybe a carboxylic acid proton. But carboxylic acids are usually broad, so that fits. So maybe a carboxylic acid group? But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, why is there a 1720 cm-1 in IR?
Wait, wait. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like in an ester or ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. But if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000, but the 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region. Wait, maybe it's an alcohol, but the 10.5 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid -OH. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is the 3400–2500 range. So the broad peak here is likely an -OH, and the 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl, maybe an ester.

But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. Hmm, 1720 is a bit higher, so maybe ester. Or maybe a ketone. Or perhaps an acid with a conjugated carbonyl, which can shift the peak higher. Alternatively, it could be an acyl chloride, but then the IR would show a stronger peak around 1800-1850 cm-1, right? So maybe an ester.

Wait, but then the broad peak in IR would correspond to an -OH group. So perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a phenol group? Let me think about the NMR.

Looking at the NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's probably the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid, since it's a broad signal. Wait, but then why 1720 cm-1 in IR? Carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl wavenumbers, around 1700. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester, and the 10.5 ppm is something else. But 10.5 is a high ppm, probably an -OH, but if it's an ester, where would that proton come from? Maybe an aromatic ring with substituents, but in that case, the -OH would be part of a phenol group. But then the IR would show a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which it does. So perhaps the compound is a phenol ester.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Let's see the other NMR signals.

Looking at the aromatic region:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
7.2 ppm (d, 2H)

That's a symmetrical pattern, like two doublets each integrating to 2H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if there are two substituents on the ring, para to each other. Let's say one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and another is perhaps an alkyl group.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, but it's broad. That suggests it's a proton that's not split, such as an -OH, perhaps in a carboxylic acid. So maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Wait, the NMR also shows:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

So these are likely part of an alkyl chain. Let's see, 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is typical for a CH(CH3)2 group, but wait, no, a doublet for 3H would be a CH3 attached to a CH with two neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 or something, like in an isopropyl group. But wait, let's think about the integration. 3H is a methyl, 2H is a CH2, and 1H is a CH.

Putting that together: There's a CH2CH(CH3) group attached somewhere. Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me try to sketch this.

The NMR peaks for the alkyl region:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a methine (CH) group, perhaps adjacent to a CH2 or something.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 next to a CH and perhaps another CH2.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): That's a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps as in a CH(CH3) group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, like at the end of an ethyl chain.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let's see: A sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to a benzene. Wait, perhaps it's a branch point. Let me think.

Alternatively, if the structure is something like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but attached to a benzene ring. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possible structure.

Looking at the options, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a branched alkyl chain leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, option D is a di-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group at positions 1 and 4. But looking at the NMR, there's a 10.5 ppm peak, which would be a problem if the product is a benzene ring because that would imply an -OH group, which option D doesn't have. So maybe that's not the case.

But wait, the initial compound is X. Let's think: what's the structure of X.

The IR suggests a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), and an -OH group (3400–2500 cm-1). The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is a single proton. That could fit a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has that -OH proton. But then, the 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid; maybe it's an ester.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is an acyl chloride. But then the IR would have a stronger peak around 1800 cm-1, and the NMR would have a different pattern. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, like a phenyl ester. For example, something like benzyl acetate. But then the -OAc group would show up as a triplet in the NMR for the CH3CO group, but I don't see that here.

Wait, looking at the NMR again: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, 1.7 is a multiplet of 2H, 1.4 is a doublet of 3H, and 0.9 is a triplet of 3H. So let's think about a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group.

Wait, more precisely, the 0.9 ppm triplet is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2. Then the CH2 next would be at 1.7 ppm as a quartet, but wait, the integration is 2H, so perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a branching point.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2CH(CH3)2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that is split by neighboring protons. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group. Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH, and the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be CH2 groups adjacent to it.

Putting that together, perhaps the structure is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3 group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-something.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group attached to a carbonyl. So, the structure would be benzene with a substituent like COOH and a sec-butyl group.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would fit. So the benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group at the para positions.

Wait, the NMR for a benzoic acid would have the -COOH proton at around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm signal. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as in para-substituted rings. So if the substituents are at para positions, the two sets of doublets would each integrate to 2H, which matches the NMR data.

The other peaks (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9) would correspond to the sec-butyl group. Let's see:

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that's longer. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2, and sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached via the first CH2. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene.

But wait, in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would correspond to the methyl group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl. So the CH has a CH3 attached to it, which would give a doublet for the CH3, as in 1.4 ppm (d,3H). Then, the CH itself is at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The adjacent CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H), and the terminal CH2 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, that seems to fit. So the substituents on the benzene would be a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

So compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Now, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

I recall that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Wait, but if the compound X is already a carboxylic acid, then what reaction would occur? Alternatively, maybe X is an ester. Wait, but the initial analysis suggested X is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe compound X is an ester. Let me go back. The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester carbonyl. The broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1 could be an alcohol or phenolic O-H. But looking back at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a 1H, so it's likely a phenolic O-H or a carboxylic acid O-H.

Wait, if X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. So maybe X is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate. But then, in the NMR, we would see the ester's CH3COO group as a triplet. But in the given NMR data, there's no such signal. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl ester, like methyl benzoate. But then the NMR would show a singlet for the OCH3 group around 3.9 ppm, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the conversion of nitriles to amines, but in the presence of an acid, I think. Wait, that's the Stephen reduction, but that's with HCl, not HI. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, so if X is an ester, like RCOOR', then reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to RCOOH and R'HI. So the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is the ester form of this, then after hydrolysis, it would become the acid.

But wait, in the initial analysis, I thought X might already be the acid, but if that's the case, reacting it with HI and red phosphorus wouldn't change it. So perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm peak would fit a carboxylic acid. So maybe X is the acid, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, another reaction: if X is a nitrile, then with HI and red phosphorus, it would form an amine. But the NMR doesn't show any amine protons, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, but the NMR doesn't show any specific protons that would indicate that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction conditions would be hydrolysis. But if X is already the acid, then what's the reaction? It wouldn't change. So perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

Wait, but in the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So perhaps X is the ester, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate methyl ester. Then, upon hydrolysis, it becomes the acid.

But looking at the NMR again, X doesn't have an ester methylene group. So maybe X isn't an ester but a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI could be used for the Clemmensen reduction of a ketone to an alkane, but that would require the presence of a ketone group.

Wait, looking at the IR, 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone as well. Let me think: ketones have carbonyl peaks around 1700-1750 cm-1. So the 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone.

If X has a ketone group, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, removing the carbonyl group and adding two hydrogens. So, if X is a ketone, the product would be the corresponding alkane.

Looking at the NMR, the presence of a carbonyl group as a ketone would not have an -OH, but the IR shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which would be an O-H. So perhaps X is a ketone with an -OH group elsewhere, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: X is a nitrile. Nitriles have strong absorption around 2220 cm-1, which isn't present here. So that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to considering X as a carboxylic acid. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then what reaction occurs upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus is sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles or esters. But if X is a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe X is an ester that gets hydrolyzed to the acid.

Wait, but the initial IR and NMR data suggest that X is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the reaction is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a benzyl ester. Let me imagine that. If X is the ester derived from 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then it would react with HI to form the acid. But the NMR would have the ester oxygen and the ester methyl group, which I don't see here.

Wait, perhaps X is a methyl ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, the IR would have the ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and the O-H stretch (broad) might not be present. But in the given IR data, the broad peak is present, which suggests an -OH group. So that might not fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about what each option would look like after the reaction.

The options are for the final product:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, if X is the starting material and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is likely a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, then perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

Looking at option C, it's a benzoic acid. So perhaps X is the ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate methyl ester, and upon hydrolysis, it becomes option C.

But looking at the NMR, the starting material (X) doesn't have the ester group, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acyl chloride. But then the IR would have a strong peak around 1800 cm-1, which it doesn't. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another angle: in the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a substitution reaction. For example, if X is an aryl chloride, HI could perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's more under specific conditions and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyne. But the IR doesn't show the C≡C peak (around 3300 cm-1), but the broad peak is more like an O-H.

Wait, maybe the starting compound X is an acid anhydride. But the IR would show a peak around 1800 cm-1, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI... I think I've heard of this being used to reduce nitriles to amines. Wait, nitriles (RCN) upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI gives RCH2NH2. But if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a primary amine.

But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a single proton, which would be unlikely for an amine (NH protons are usually broad but might not be singlets unless there's something else). Also, the options don't have amines; they're all alkanes or acids.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a vinyl chloride. But again, the IR doesn't show the C-Cl stretch (around 600-800 cm-1), which isn't present, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aromatic ester. Let me think about that. If X is an aryl ester, like methyl benzoate, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to benzoic acid.

But in that case, the NMR of X would show the ester group, which I don't see here. For example, the OCH3 group would have a triplet around 3.9 ppm, which is absent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece together the structure.

From the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): probably -COOH or phenol O-H.
- 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H): para-substituted benzene.
- The 1.4 ppm (d,3H): likely a methyl attached to a CH, which is part of a branch.

So, the structure is likely a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that includes a COOH group and a branched alkyl chain.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Wait, but then the NMR would have more peaks.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. No, that would make the substituent too long.

Wait, maybe it's a -COOH group and a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that would make the substituent a -CH2CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene, which is a neopentyl group.

Wait, but then the NMR peaks wouldn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COO- group (ester) and another group, but that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propyl chain leading to a carbonyl group. For example, something like CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene at the para position, along with another substituent.

Wait, but I'm not getting it right. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 4 and a -sec-butyl group at position 4? No, wait, no. Wait, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH group at position 1 (assuming the substituent is at position 4), but wait, wait. Benzoic acid is usually at position 1, so 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). That would explain the NMR aromatic peaks as two doublets, each integrating to 2H, because the substituents are para to each other.

The NMR of the alkyl group would then correspond to the sec-butyl group.

So, the NMR peaks for the alkyl group in the sec-butyl would be:

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)
- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- The CH group attached to the benzene at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- The methyl group attached to the CH at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)

Yes, that matches perfectly. So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, but 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is a carboxylic acid. What reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI? I'm a bit confused because I'm more familiar with red phosphorus being used in reactions like the hydrolysis of esters or the Clemmensen reduction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X is an ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid. But earlier analysis suggested X is the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination. Wait, the problem states that X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, maybe it's a case of acid-catalyzed decarboxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid. But if X is the acid, then perhaps the reaction doesn't change it.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think again. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility is that X is a nitrile, and the reaction reduces it to an amine. But earlier analysis suggested that X is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a methyl ester of the acid. Then, the reaction would hydrolyze it to the acid. But the NMR doesn't show the ester group.

Another angle: the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound definitely has an aromatic ring.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests para substitution.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps nothing happens, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride, but that would require different conditions, like SOCl2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each step:

1. Identify X based on IR and NMR.
2. Determine the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI.

From the data, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Now, what does HI and red phosphorus do to a carboxylic acid? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, but the NMR doesn't show the ester group.

Wait, unless the ester is attached in a way that doesn't show up as a separate peak. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound that upon reaction gives one of the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is an ester that becomes the acid upon reaction, then the product would be option C. But X would be the ester before the reaction, but the NMR data doesn't show an ester.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. Wait, if X is a bromo compound, then HI could induce elimination. But I don't see any evidence for that in the data.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester with a benzoyl group and an alkoxy group, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Another thought: perhaps the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a ketone. Then, the reaction would reduce the ketone to an alkane via the Clemmensen reduction. But where would the ketone be?

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any protons that would correspond to a ketone. Unless it's a methyl ketone, but the 10.5 ppm peak would be a carbonyl proton, which isn't present.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative. But then, the NMR would show a singlet for the carbonyl protons, but it doesn't.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the answer options again. If the correct product is option C, then perhaps X is an ester that becomes the acid upon reaction. But the NMR of X doesn't show the ester group, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to an amine, but the options don't include an amine. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenol ester. For example, methyl salicylate. But the NMR would have the OCH3 group, which isn't present.

Wait, I think I've exhausted most possibilities. Let me summarize:

Based on the NMR and IR data, X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid, maybe it doesn't react because it's already a carboxylic acid. But that can't be the case because the question states it reacts. So perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

Wait, but the IR of X shows an -OH (broad) and a carbonyl, which could be from an ester. Wait, no, esters don't have an -OH. Wait, no, wait. If X is an ester, then the IR would have the ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1) but no broad -OH. The broad peak in IR suggests an -OH, so perhaps X is a carboxylic acid.

Then, what reaction would a carboxylic acid undergo with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a substitution reaction if X has a leaving group, but the NMR doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of X. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The 10.5 ppm NMR is a single proton, likely -OH. So if X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it. But that can't be the case because the question says it reacts.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but that would require a beta-hydroxy group, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, but then the NMR would show the ester's OCH2 group, which it doesn't.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the options. The options are the products after the reaction. So perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

Looking at the options, option C is the acid. So X must be the ester.

Wait, but according to the NMR data, X doesn't have the ester group. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrolysis but a reduction or something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is a benzilic acid, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenylacetone (acetophenone derivative) with a substituent. Then, the reaction would reduce it to an ethylbenzene derivative.

But then, the product would be an alkane.

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a di-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group at para positions. That would form from the reduction of a ketone, perhaps.

Wait, if X is a ketone, like 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then upon Clemmensen reduction with red phosphorus and HI, it would reduce the ketone to a methylene group, yielding 4-(sec-butyl)ethylbenzene or something similar. But that doesn't directly match any of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid (option C). So the product would be option C.

But in that case, the NMR of X (the ester) would show the ester group, which I'm not seeing. Unless the ester is something else, like an internal ester, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a more complex structure. For example, if X is a methyl ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, its NMR would have the OCH3 group as a singlet around 3.9 ppm, which isn't present in the given data. So that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to make a decision based on what I have.

The NMR and IR data point towards X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When treated with red phosphorus and HI, which are acidic conditions, perhaps it doesn't react because it's already the acid. But since the question states it reacts, maybe the reaction isn't about X but about a different structure.

Wait, perhaps X is a methyl ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid. So, the product is option C. But I don't have the ester group in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the ester group and forming the acid. So, the product is option C.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data to deduce the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: A broad peak, indicative of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of the -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals correspond to a branched alkyl chain, specifically a sec-butyl group.

### Structure of Compound X:
Based on the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, it does not undergo further reaction under these conditions. Thus, the final product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Does not match the NMR or IR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Lacks the -OH group indicated by the IR and NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Matches the IR, NMR, and reaction conditions.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Lacks the -OH group and does not match the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
