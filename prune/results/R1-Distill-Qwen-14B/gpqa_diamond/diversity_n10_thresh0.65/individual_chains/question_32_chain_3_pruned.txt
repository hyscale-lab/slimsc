Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy of the collider such that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 has 3 neutrons because lithium typically has 3 protons. Wait, Li-6 has 3 neutrons, so its atomic number is 3 (protons) and mass number is 6 (3 protons +3 neutrons). So X is lithium-6.

Next, the problem is about relativistic speeds. Since the speed is 0.96c, that's pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely in play. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy but includes kinetic energy as well. The total energy is gamma times the rest energy. 

So the formula I think I'll need is E = gamma * m0c², where m0 is the rest mass. And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, but what's the rest mass of the lithium-6 nucleus? I'll need to calculate that. Lithium-6 has an atomic mass unit (u) that I can look up, but I think it's approximately 6.015 atomic mass units. Each u is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m0 = 6.015 * u.

Let me compute that. 6.015 times 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Let me do the multiplication. 6 times 1.66 is about 9.96, but more accurately:

6.015 * 1.6605390666e-27 = let's see. 6 * 1.6605... is 9.9632344, and 0.015 * 1.6605 is 0.024908. Adding them together gives approximately 9.9881424e-27 kg. So m0 is about 9.988e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Maybe I should double-check the molar mass. Let me think, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 u. Yes, that sounds right.

So m0c² is the rest energy. So E_rest = m0c². And since we're looking for the total energy E, which is gamma times E_rest.

But wait, the problem asks for the energy of the RHIC. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy. In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually mean the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about this.

Wait, no, for heavy ions like this,
