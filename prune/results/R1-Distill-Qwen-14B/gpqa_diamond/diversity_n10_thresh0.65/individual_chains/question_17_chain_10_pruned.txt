Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, okay.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and formation constants? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions to form complexes. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

So, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. I think I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, the concentration of free Ca²+ would be much lower than the concentration of the complex itself, especially if Kf is large, which it is here.

Let me write down the relevant equation. The formation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA is usually in different forms because of the pH. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I think that means the EDTA is in the form that
