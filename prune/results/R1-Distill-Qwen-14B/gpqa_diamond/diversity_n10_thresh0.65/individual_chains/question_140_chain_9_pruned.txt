Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about gas W. The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, that's a bit tricky. So for a molecule, each atom contributes protons and neutrons. But if the molecule as a whole has equal number of neutrons and protons, maybe it's a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps it's a molecule where the total of protons equals the total of neutrons.

Wait, for example, if W is H2O, then H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), but wait, that's per atom. Let me think. Another possibility is noble gases. For example, He is just one atom, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons? No, Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons (2 each). Then He would fit, but He is a monoatomic gas. So if gas W is He, then each molecule (He atom) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so protons equal neutrons. Another example: maybe CO2? Let's see. But wait, no, because CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons typically) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons would be 6 + 16 =22, total neutrons would be 6 + (16 *2) = 38. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe a diatomic molecule where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. Like H2, but each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium). So H2 would have 2
