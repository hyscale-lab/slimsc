Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, there are a few steps with different reagents, and finally, we need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

First, let's break down each step:

1. **Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C**:
   I remember that KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Oh, but wait, in adamantane, the structure is such that 1 and 3 might actually be adjacent via different paths. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a diene? Or maybe it's a ring-opening reaction. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four rings. If 1 and 3 are each bearing a bromine, perhaps when treated with KOH, each Br leaves, and the structure forms a double bond. But wait, KOH in such conditions might cause a double elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but in the first step, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data is given: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. Wait, no, because if it's from elimination, I would expect an alkene. But 1720 is more like a carbonyl (like ester, ketone, aldehyde). Hmm, maybe I was wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but with KOH and dibromide, substitution might lead to a diol. But why would that give a carbonyl peak? Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but the product has a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps instead of elimination, it's an oxidation. But no, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the dibromide is undergoing a Hofmann or some other elimination? Wait, wait. Maybe the product is an epoxide, but no, that would come from a different reaction.

Wait, let me think again. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl. So the product after KOH treatment must have a carbonyl group. So, what reaction of a dibromide with KOH would form a carbonyl?

Oh! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Wait, but how? Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the E2 elimination, but forming a carbonyl? Wait, maybe it's a conjugate elimination or some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it forms a cyclic structure. Since the product has a carbonyl, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the NMR data of product 1. There's a singlet at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That's probably a methylene group, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests some methylene or methine groups in a rigid structure, perhaps adamantane derivatives. The 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, then the NMR would show a triplet from the oxygen adjacent CH2 groups. But the IR
