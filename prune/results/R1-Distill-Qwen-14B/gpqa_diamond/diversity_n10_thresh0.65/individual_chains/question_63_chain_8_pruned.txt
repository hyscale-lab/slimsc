Okay, let's try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, it's about a diatomic molecule switching energy states. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can be modeled using different models depending on their behavior. Here, it's the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy states.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for a given vibrational level, right? Oh wait, no, maybe the fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibration state, but the molecule might also have rotational states. So the 'fundamental state' probably refers to the lowest energy state overall, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. Since the question asks for the lowest possible energy jump, it must be the transition where the molecule moves to the next higher state in either rotation or vibration, whichever requires the least energy.

Hmm, but wait, the energy levels in rotation and vibration are quantized differently. Vibration has quantized energy levels with spacing hν, where ν is the frequency. Rotation has energy levels that depend on the rotational constant, which is related to the moment of inertia.

Let me think: the energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h ν. So the ground state has n=0 and J=0.

So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next state could be either n=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). We need to find which transition requires less energy because the photon's momentum is related to the energy change.

Wait, but the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's the transition that requires the least energy. So I think we need to calculate both possible energy changes and pick the smaller one.

Alternatively, perhaps the model assumes that the main transition is vibrational. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the 'fundamental state' is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), but the molecule can also rotate. So the first excited state could be n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). Whichever has lower energy difference will absorb the photon with that energy.

So let's calculate both ΔE options.

First, calculate the energy difference for vibrational transition: from n=0 to n=1.

ΔE_vib = (1 + 1/2) h ν - (0 + 1/2) h ν = (1.5 - 0.5) h ν = h ν.

So that's h multiplied by the angular frequency, but wait, wait: ν is the frequency, which is ω/(2π). Oh wait, the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, so ν = ω/(2π) = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ approx 6.37e13 Hz.

Wait, but
