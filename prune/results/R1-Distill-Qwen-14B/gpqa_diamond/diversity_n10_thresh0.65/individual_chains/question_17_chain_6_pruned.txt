Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution, right?

Alright, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, wait, stoichiometric—so that's a 1:1 ratio, I think. So each Ca^2+ is bound to one EDTA^4- ion. So the formula would be something like CaEDTA^2- or CaY^2- maybe? Not sure about the exact charge, but I don't think that's super relevant right now.

The pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about the EDTA speciation. That's good because EDTA's behavior can get complicated with pH affecting its form. So we can assume that all the EDTA is in its active form, Y^4- maybe.

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. Wait, K is the formation constant, right? The formation constant for the complex. So K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Our goal is to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], in the solution.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation. When the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA^2- will release one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So let's set up an ICE table. Initial concentrations: [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are both zero initially. At equilibrium, some of the complex will dissociate. Let's let x be the amount that dissociates. So:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the formation constant is very large, which suggests that the complex is very stable. So the reverse reaction is favored, meaning that the complex doesn't dissociate much. So x is a small number, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So at equilibrium, [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x. So plugging into the K expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So rearranging, 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) *1e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt
