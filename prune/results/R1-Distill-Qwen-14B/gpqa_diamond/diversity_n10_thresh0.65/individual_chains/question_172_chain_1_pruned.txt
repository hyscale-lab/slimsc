Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann distribution. Let me think.

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution formula is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. The formula is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights and ΔE is the energy difference.

Wait, but since the question is comparing the same energy levels in two different stars, I probably need to set up two equations and then find a relation between their temperatures.

Let me denote the excitation ratio for star_1 as (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2. For star_2, it's (n2_upper / n2_lower) = 1, since it's half as excited. But wait, no, the problem says star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2. So star_1's ratio is 2 times star_2's. Wait, no, the problem says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the population in the upper level relative to the lower. So if star_1 has twice as much in that state, then (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But wait, the energy difference is given, so perhaps I can write the ratio for each star and then take the ratio of those ratios.

Let me write the equations. For star_1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
Similarly, for star_2: (n2_upper / n2_lower) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))?

Wait, no. Wait, the statistical weights are for the two levels, so in the ratio, it's (g_upper / g_lower) for each star. But the problem says "a specific energy level"—maybe the statistical weights are the same for both stars because it's the same transition in iron. So the g's would cancel out when taking the ratio.

So let me assume that g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars because it's the same transition. So for star_1, the ratio is (n1_upper / n1_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)).
Same for star_2, (n2_upper / n2_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

According to the problem, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

(n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

Which means exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(
