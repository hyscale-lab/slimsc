Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

So, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I remember that the dithiocyanato complex is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^n+. But I'm not sure about the exact structure or the charge. But I think each SCN- is monodentate, so the complex would have two SCN- ions.

Stability constants, β, are for the formation of the complex. So, for each complex, the β is the equilibrium constant. So, for the first complex, β1 is for Co(SCN), the second β2 is for Co(SCN)₂, and so on up to β4, which would be Co(SCN)_4, I guess.

Wait, but β4 is 16. That seems lower than β3, which is 63. Hmm, maybe the fourth complex isn't the most stable? Or perhaps the stability depends on the structure—maybe high spin or something else.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex. So that's the second complex, β2=40. But wait, the options are percentages, so I think the question is asking about the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂], β3 for [Co(SCN)₃], and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2-? Or maybe the charges vary. But I'm not sure about the exact charge here. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe that doesn't matter because we can focus on the formation of each species relative to the others
