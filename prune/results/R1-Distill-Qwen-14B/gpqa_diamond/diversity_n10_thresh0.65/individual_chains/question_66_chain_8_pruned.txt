Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are supposed to be consistent with the underlying theory, like the full theory beyond the Standard Model. So the operators added must obey certain symmetries.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Lorentz includes rotations and boosts. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz as well. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So do all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare?

Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because it's a field theory, right? So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. That means Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected by all operators. As for Poincare symmetry, since it's a field theory, it's Poincare-invariant. But does every operator respect Poincare? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Poincare includes translational symmetry, which is about the theory being invariant under shifts in position. But when you add higher-dimensional operators, I think you have to ensure that the theory is still Lorentz and Poincare invariant. So operators must be Poincare scalars, meaning both Lorentz and translation invariant. So both 1 and 2 must hold. So any operator violating Lorentz symmetry would be a problem, same with Poincare.

But wait, I've heard that SMEFT is constructed to be Poincare-invariant. So all operators must respect that. So options 1 and 2 are both necessary.

Now, what about CP symmetry (option 3)? I'm not so sure. I know that the Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric because of things like the CKM phase. So operators in SMEFT could violate CP, right? For example, some dimension six operators would involve terms that break CP. So not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must. That would eliminate options B and D, which include 3.

What about CPT symmetry (option 4)? CPT is a big one. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement. It's a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Every term in the Lagrangian must be invariant under CPT. Because if it's not, that would violate some deep principles, perhaps leading to inconsistencies. So SMEFT, as a valid effective theory, must respect CPT symmetry. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Putting it all together: which of the options include 1 and 2, and 4, but exclude 3?

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 â†’ only includes Lorentz and Poincare. But what about CPT? The question says 'must
