Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching. So the compound probably has an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak is usually even broader and maybe around 2500-3300. But the question says a very broad peak, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps an ether? No, ethers don't have O-H, so that's not it.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Ooh, those could be carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a ketone or ester, and the 1650 might be an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl. Wait, another possibility is an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl like an ester or a ketone with some conjugation. Or maybe a carbonyl with an adjacent double bond, like a ketone next to a vinyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, typically showing up around 4.5-7 ppm as a pair of doublets or a triplet, depending on substitution. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. Maybe an alkene group, perhaps part of a ring or as a substituent.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think, what has a mass of 45? The molecular ion could be breaking into smaller fragments. Let's calculate possible fragments. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is around 91, but that's not 45. Wait, 45 could be the (CH2O) group, maybe a formaldehyde fragment or something. Or perhaps a (CH3O) group, but that's 31. Oh wait, 45 could be a fragment like (CH2CH2O), but I'm not sure. Wait, 45 is the same as (C3H7O), but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a ketone group. Let me think: if the molecule has a carbonyl, maybe a (COCH2CH2) or something. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has an ester group, which upon fragmentation could lose the R group and leave the ester part, but I'm not exactly sure.

Now, let's look at the options. The possible formulas are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Hmm. So let's consider the degrees of unsaturation for each formula. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or
