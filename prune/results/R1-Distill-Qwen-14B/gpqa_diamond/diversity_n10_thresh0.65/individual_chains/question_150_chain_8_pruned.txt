Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a good starting point. The NMR data is given, so that should help me figure out the structure. Then, the compound undergoes three reactions: first with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to find the final product from the options given.

Wait, the reactions... NaNO2 and HCl? Oh right, that's usually for diazotization. Diazonium salt formation, typically with aromatic amines. But wait, the compound has an N in the formula. So maybe it's an aromatic amine or some other N-containing group.

But looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in the molecule, maybe it's an NH proton, but that's usually around 1-5 ppm. No, wait, aldehyde is higher, so 9.72 is likely an aldehyde proton.

Then, looking at the other signals. 6.98 ppm, a doublet of 2H. That could be part of an aromatic ring. The next peak is 6.51 ppm, another doublet, 2H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Since the doublets are 2H each, perhaps a para arrangement. So the aromatic ring would have substituents in the para positions.

Then 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet of 2H. Broad could mean something like an aromatic ring with substituents that have some coupling, or maybe it's a vinyl or another type of proton. Hmm. Also, a triplet could be adjacent to some coupling. Wait, the triplet at 9.72 is 1H, and it's a triplet. Aldehydes in NMR are usually singlets because there's no neighboring protons. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually at around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. They are typically split only if adjacent to other protons, but aldehy
