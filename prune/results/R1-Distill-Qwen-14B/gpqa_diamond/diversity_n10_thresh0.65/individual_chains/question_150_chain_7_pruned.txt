Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step. 

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. They provided the 1H-NMR data, and then a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is after these reactions. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I'll look at the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me break down the NMR peaks:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, as those usually appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H. So maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, an acidic proton like from a phenol or an enol? But 9.72 is quite upfield for an aldehyde. Or perhaps an alpha proton to a carbonyl, or an enol proton? Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde or an enol tautomer.

Wait, looking at the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each with 2H. That sounds like two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Because for para substituents, the coupling would result in two doublets each integrating to 2H. So perhaps two phenyl groups attached.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange process, like an acidic proton, such as an enol or phenol. But why 2H? Maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen. Another thought: perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else.

Then the 3.66 ppm doublet with 2H. That's likely a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like an O. Maybe an OCH2O group? Or a CH
