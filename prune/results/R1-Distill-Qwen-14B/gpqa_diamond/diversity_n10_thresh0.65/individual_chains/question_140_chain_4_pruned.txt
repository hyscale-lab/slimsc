Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem starts with Substance X. It says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. I remember that isotopes are variants of elements with the same number of protons but different neutrons. So, for example, chlorine has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37. But which element is X made of? Hmm.

Next, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, wait. So the molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about that. 

If a molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons overall, maybe the molecule is symmetrical in some way, like O2 or N2. But wait, what about H2O? No, because in H2O, each oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (I think), and each hydrogen has 1 proton and maybe a neutron? Wait, but hydrogen is usually considered as H-1 (protium), which has no neutrons. So H2O has 2 H (each with 1p, 0n) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So the total protons: 2 +8 =10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think of elements where the molecule has same protons and neutrons. Oh wait, maybe it's CO2? No, because CO2 has a molecule of C and two O atoms. Wait, let's think about the individual atoms. Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons in total?

No, the molecule as a whole must have equal number of protons and neutrons. So for example, H2 has two hydrogens, each with 1p and 0n. So total p=2, n=0. Not equal. Wait, maybe CH4? No, but that's not a gas, maybe? Or wait, perhaps the gas is something like NH3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the molecule is something like CH3Cl? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is a diatomic molecule where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. For instance, if each atom is something like Cl, which has 17 protons. Cl-35 has 18 neutrons, so 17 p and 18 n. Hmm, that's not equal. Or maybe another element. Wait, what about carbon? Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So each C atom has p=6, n=6. So if W is CO2, the molecule would have 1 C and 2 O. Each O has 8p, 8n. So C contributes 6 p and 6n, each O contributes 8p and 8n. Total p: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Total n: 6 + 2*8 =22. Oh! So the molecule of CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the condition.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, yes. Does it make
