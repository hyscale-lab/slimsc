Alright, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, okay, let me think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp chain is a big one, especially in the core. The pp-III branch is part of this process. Neutrinos are produced during these reactions, right? So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

The question is asking about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how each band's flux is affected when the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch produces specific neutrino energies. Oh right, the main neutrinos in the Sun come from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-1 and pp-2 branches, but wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain. Let me get this straight.

The proton-proton chain has a few steps. The first part is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. That's the main source of the 0.26 MeV neutrinos, right? Then, there's the pp-III branch which comes into play when there's a helium-3 involved. Oh, wait, no, the pp-III is a later stage where three protons fuse in a different way, perhaps involving a helium-3 nucleus.

Wait, neutrinos are emitted at specific energies
