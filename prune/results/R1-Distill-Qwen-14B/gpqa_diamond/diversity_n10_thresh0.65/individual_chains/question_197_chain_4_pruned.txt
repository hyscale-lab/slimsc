Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. Red phosphorus and HI usually mean some kind of elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, isn't that a Hofmann elimination type scenario? Or maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, when you have an organohalide reacting with phosphorus and HI, that's more likely to be a substitution, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution. Or wait, no, another thought: sometimes when you have a dihalide, like with vicinal dihalides, red phosphorus can help eliminate to form an alkene. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the IR and NMR data.

The IR data includes strong absorption between 3400-2500 cm⁻¹. That's a broad region, probably OH or NH stretches. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe X has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an acid.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty downfield shift. Maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but it's a broad signal. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton, but that's less likely if it's an acidic solution. Hmm, but in DMSO, the signals might shift up. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic -OH, but those are usually around 5 ppm
