Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

The question involves an electron state |alpha> which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form the basis for our state vector here. 

The first part of the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix A looks like this:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm, that matrix looks familiar. I think it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices usually have 1s and 0s, but if multiplied by a factor, this could be similar. So maybe this operator is related to the spin in the x-direction?

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if I multiply that by ħ/2, I get exactly the matrix given. So the operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x. Since σ_x has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |up> and |down>, specifically (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, those should be the eigenstates of A.

So the first task is to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because once we have that, the coefficients will give us the probabilities. 

But wait, the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's compute the normalization factor first because the state is only given as "proportional". 

The normalization is done by taking the inner product of |alpha> with itself. So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i). 

Calculating each term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Similarly, (2-i)(2+i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. So the sum is 2+5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2-i)/√7 |down>.

Now, to find the probability of measuring the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/√2.

We need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>. 

Let me denote |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>. 

Expanding |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/√2 + b (|up> − |down>)/√2.

This can be rewritten as:

|alpha> = (a + b)/√2 |up> + (a − b)/√2 |down>.

Comparing this with our given |alpha>, which is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 − i)/√7 |down>, we can set up the following equations:

(a + b)/√2 = (1 + i)/√7 → equation (1)
(a − b)/√2 = (2 − i)/√7 → equation (2)

Let me solve these equations for a and b.

Let me multiply both equations by √2 to eliminate the denominator:

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7) → equation (1a)
a − b = (2 − i) * sqrt(2/7) → equation (2a)

Now, adding equation (1a) and (2a):

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 − i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
Simplify the numerator: 1 + i + 2 - i = 3. So:

2a = 3 * sqrt(2/7) → a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = 3*sqrt(2)/(2*sqrt(7)).

But let me compute sqrt(2/7) as sqrt(14)/7 (since sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)/7). Wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(14)/7? Let me check: sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(
