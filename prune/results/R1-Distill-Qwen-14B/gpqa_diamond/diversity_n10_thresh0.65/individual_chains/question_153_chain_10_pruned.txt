Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break this question down step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a 1,4-addition, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, and the carbonyl gets conjugated, leading to a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate. 

The problem has three separate reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each with given reactants and conditions, and I need to determine the major products. Let's take them one by one.

First, let's look at reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it's probably deprotonating something to form an enolate. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. Its structure is something like CH2(CO2Me)2. So in the presence of a base, it will form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. 

Wait, the acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-p-tolyl group attached to a carbonyl. Wait, no, the structure of methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the acrylate. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon, which is the one adjacent to the carbonyl. So the attack would be on the second carbon of the acrylate.

So the malonate's enolate has a negative charge on the central carbon (the alpha position), and it will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The addition should give a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. 

After the addition, there's a conjugate base that would pick up a proton. But wait, in Michael
