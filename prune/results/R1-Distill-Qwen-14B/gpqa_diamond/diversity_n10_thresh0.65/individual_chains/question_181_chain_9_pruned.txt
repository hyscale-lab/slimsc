Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, and the question is about what happens if one of these branches stops. Let me think.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Oh right, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos?) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stops, whatever effect it has should manifest on Earth after about that time. But for this question, we're considering the flux right now, so the effect would have reached us, I guess.

The question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So we need to find flux(band1)/flux(band2).

I think the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main pp reaction produces a lot of neutrinos. But wait, wait, pp-I, pp-II, pp-III... I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I remember that the dominant process in the Sun is the pp-I branch. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant, perhaps in regions with higher temperatures or different conditions.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe the 8B neutrinos? Or is that another process. Or wait, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a specific energy range. Let me think. So the pp chain has different branches. The main pp-I branch produces two positrons and a
