Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think through this. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means their density doesn't change with distance. I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to think about how parallax and distance connect.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa. So distance d is 1/plx.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Oh, so it's like the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density should be the same throughout space. That means the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume itself.

Let's model this. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. Since d is 1/plx, I can substitute that in. So volume V is 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But wait, dr is the change in distance, so I need to relate that to the change in parallax dplx. 

How does dr relate to dplx? Let's think about differentiation. Since plx = 1/d, then dplx = -1/d² dr. Hmm, that gives dr = -d² dplx. But since plx is small (for large distances), the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases. So the absolute value, dr = (1/plx²) dplx. 

Substituting back into the volume: V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, that simplifies to 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. But wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check that differentiation step.

Actually, let me correct that. The relation is plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The differential of d with respect to plx is dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So dr, a small change in r, is (dr) = (dd/dplx) * (dplx) = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since we're considering the magnitude, it's (1/plx²) dplx. 

So
