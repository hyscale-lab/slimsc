Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I need to determine which ones are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key here is their apparent V magnitude because both instruments have different brightness limits.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the information says for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Hmm, wait, wait, actually, the wording is a bit tricky. It says "brighter than 17 mag" but in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So when they say brighter than 17, that means apparent magnitude less than 17. Because the scale is inverted. So a star with apparent V magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17; it's brighter than a 17 magnitude star.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So same logic, apparent magnitude less than 16.

So each star's apparent V magnitude is what determines if it can be observed. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see if it's below (brighter than) 17 for ESPRESSO and below 16 for HIRES.

Wait, but wait. For some stars, like Star1 and Star4, they have
