Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The question gives me five stars with various properties, and I need to figure out which of them are observable by both instruments.

First, I'll try to understand the setup. The key points I remember are that each spectrograph has a different limit on the apparent V magnitude of the stars they can observe. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait: wait, the way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So ESPRESSO can see stars that are up to 17 mag. Similarly, HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 mag. Wait, no, the wording is that for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no: "brighter than 17 mag" would mean they're more prominent, so they have lower magnitudes. So, for bright stars, the magnitudes are lower. So, a star with V=10 is brighter than a star with V=20. So, if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than V=17, that would include stars with V mag less than or equal to 17, right? Because brighter stars
