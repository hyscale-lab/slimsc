Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes if a certain reaction suddenly stops. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped hypothetically about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate time it takes for sunlight to reach Earth, since the Sun is about 8 light minutes away. So if the pp-III branch stopped, the neutrinos would be affected, and we'd see the effect on Earth now.

I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces helium-4. The pp-II branch might produce some boron-8, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. The pp-III branch is another part of the proton-proton cycle, maybe involving higher energy reactions. Oh wait, pp-III is part of the process where protons fuse into heavier nuclei, but I'm not exactly sure what it produces in terms of neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in several places in the Sun. The main sources are the decay of boron-8 (from the pp chain) and the decay of heavier elements in the CNO cycle. Oh wait, the pp chain produces a lot of neutrinos, mainly electron neutrinos, right?

If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, that must mean that a certain part of the neutrino production is halted. But wait, what fraction of the total neutrino flux comes from the pp-III branch?

Hmm, I think the pp-I branch is the most dominant, producing about 90% of the neutrinos,
