Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(parallax)^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with various exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (r), but I think it's in parsecs or something, so plx = 1/r. Oh wait, right! Parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

So if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute plx with 1/r. Let's do that. So substituting, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's simplify that.

1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Then, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range? Wait, per unit range of distance r — so I think they're asking about the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r, maybe? Or the density as a function of r?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The number of stars per unit volume would depend on the density. But the question is about the number varying per distance r, meaning how does N change as r changes. So if N is
