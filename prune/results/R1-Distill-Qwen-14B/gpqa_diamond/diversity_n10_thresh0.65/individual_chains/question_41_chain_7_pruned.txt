Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass when the glass is moving. Hmm, I remember some basics from my classes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, which I guess is the usual c, so maybe the units are such that c=1.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I think when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't ignore relativistic effects. But wait, the problem doesn't specify that v is a significant fraction of c. Oh wait, but the index of refraction is n, which for glass is typically around 1.5 or something. So maybe n is much less than c, but when you multiply by v, I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The speed of light in glass at rest is c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c divided by n. So when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light in the glass?

Wait, but this is about the speed of light in the glass, as observed from the lab frame. So the glass is moving, and the light is inside it. How do we calculate the speed here?
