Alright, so I've got this question here about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, okay, let me think. So the question says there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It says that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle at the same time. The principle is delta_E * delta_t ~ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (delta_E) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (delta_t). So if the lifetime is shorter, the uncertainty in energy is larger, making it harder to distinguish small energy differences.

But wait, what's the exact relation here? The formula I recall is delta_E = ħ / (2 * delta_t). Or maybe it's approximately equal because the exact factor might depend on the context. But for the sake of this problem, I think using delta_E ≈ ħ / delta_t is a good starting point.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, the options are given in electron volts (eV), so I'll need to convert units.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state.
2. The energy difference between E1 and E2 (ΔE) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be distinguishable. Or wait, maybe it's larger than the individual uncertainties? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait,
