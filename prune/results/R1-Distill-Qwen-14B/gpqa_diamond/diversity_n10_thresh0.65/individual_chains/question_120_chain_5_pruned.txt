Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. So plx = 1/distance, or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I think I need to figure out how star density relates to parallax. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number should depend on the volume they occupy. Hmm, because in three dimensions, more distant stars would occupy a larger volume, but if their distribution is uniform, the number density would change with distance.

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. Since plx = 1/d (in parsecs), when plx is small, the distance is large. So for a given range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Wait, let's model this. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. If plx increases by a small amount dplx, then d decreases. So the distance range would be from d = 1/(plx) to d = 1/(plx + dplx). 

But when plx is small, like for very distant stars, even a small change in plx corresponds to a larger change in distance. Wait, maybe I should find the relationship between the volume element and parallax.

The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so N = n * V, where n is the number density. But since we're
