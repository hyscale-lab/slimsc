Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, right?

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. So both planets have similar masses. The orbits are circular, which probably means the same eccentricity, but I don't think that affects the orbital period in this context.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. Wait, the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, P2/P1.

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The shift in wavelength depends on K. So K is higher when the star's velocity is higher. K would be larger if the planet is more massive or if it's closer to the star. Since both stars are the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the difference in K must be due to the distance of the planet from the star.

Wait, the formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * sqrt(1-e^2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but wait, maybe I should think of the simplified version. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_p/M_star is negligible. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/2)) ) maybe? Or wait, another approach.

Another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)
