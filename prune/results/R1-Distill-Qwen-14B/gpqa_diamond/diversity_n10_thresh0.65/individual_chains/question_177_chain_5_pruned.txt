Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. From what I remember, luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits, right? The formula I think is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and π is pi. Oh wait, yeah, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation.

So, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Hmm, but wait, does mass play a role here? Well, in the problem statement, the question is about luminosities calculated using blackbody radiation, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant. Unless... Maybe the mass is a red herring, or perhaps it's needed for some other aspect, but for calculating luminosity based on temperature and radius, I think it's not needed. So maybe I can ignore the mass part for this particular calculation.

Next, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength λ_max of a blackbody is given by Wien's law: λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.898 ×10^-3 m·K). So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be inversely proportional to each other. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T.

So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So T1 = T2? Because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is same, then T must be same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but then again, the problem says the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_max is same, so their temperatures are same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but let me think again. The peak wavelength is where the star emits most of its radiation. So if both have the same λ_max, same T. So T1 = T2.

So now, compute luminosity for both stars. L1 = 4πσ R1² T1⁴, and L2 = 4πσ R2² T2⁴. Since T1 = T2, and R1 = 1.5 R2, substituting, L1 = 4πσ (1.5 R2)^2 T^4. L2 is 4πσ R2² T^4. So the ratio L1/L2 would be ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So according to this, the factor would be 2.25, so option A is 2.25.

But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh right, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. How does that come into play?

Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So when a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. The actual emitted wavelength is shifted by the Doppler effect. But in this problem, the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So that must be the observed λ_max, not the
