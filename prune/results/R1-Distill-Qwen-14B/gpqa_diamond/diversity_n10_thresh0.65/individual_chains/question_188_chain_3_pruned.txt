Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, so that's like the length of the edges in the unit cell, I think. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember there's a formula for that. Oh yeah, it's using the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. 

The formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(h l cos beta) + 2(k l cos alpha) ) ). Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Or wait, another approach: for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by d_hkl = a/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think that's for something else. 

Wait, wait. For a cubic system, like simple cubic, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But rhombohedral is a bit different. Oh right,
