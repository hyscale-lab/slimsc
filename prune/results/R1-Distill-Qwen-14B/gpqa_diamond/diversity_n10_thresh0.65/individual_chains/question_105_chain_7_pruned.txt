Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about a star with some dark spots, and we need to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on how much area the planet covers relative to the star.

Wait, the star here has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is about the same as our Sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, right, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So if the entire hemisphere were covered, the filling factor would be 100%, but here it's 20%, so 0.2.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so they're 5000K. But wait, how does that affect the brightness variation? Oh, because when the spots are facing us, they contribute less light than the rest of the star. So as the star rotates, the spots move into and out of view. Since they're on one hemisphere, the brightness variation will depend on how much of the spots are visible as the star spins.

So the problem says that when only one hemisphere is spotted, the photometric observations (which measure brightness over time) show periodic variations because of the rotation. But in this scenario, when the star is not covered by spots, what would cause the same brightness variation? An exoplanet transit, perhaps. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So perhaps the spots are causing a certain variation in brightness, and we need an exoplanet to cause the same variation. So the amplitude of the signal (the depth of the brightness dip) should be the same.

So the key is to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then set the planet's effect equal to that.

Let me think about how brightness variation works. When a part of the star is cooler, it emits less light. The total brightness we receive depends on the area of the
