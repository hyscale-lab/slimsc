Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps, so I'll need to break them down one by one.

First, the reaction steps:

1. A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Also, there are some hints provided. Let's look at them.

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So A must be an aldehyde or ketone reacting with a ylide to form an alkene.

The product from the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize this structure. So it's a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The substituents are methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent like CH2-C(CH3)= something?

Wait, the Wittig reaction forms an alkene. So the product has a double bond. The structure given has a cyclopentane ring with substituents. So the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's an allyl group attached. Wait, actually, the propan-2-ylidene group would be (CH3)2C=CHâ€“ attached to the ring? Or perhaps it's a substituent like a cyclopropane or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent on the ring, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH
