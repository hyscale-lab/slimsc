Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. This particular question gives a specific density matrix, and I need to figure out where it's located geometrically.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this is a diagonal matrix because the off-diagonal terms are zero. Let me write this out. The computational basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthonormal, so when you take their outer products, you get diagonal matrices.

So, |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Adding them together, each diagonal element becomes 1, so the sum without the 1/2 would be [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. But then we multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with elements 1/2 and 1/2.

Wait, but what does this represent? I think this is a completely mixed state. Because when a system is in a completely mixed state, its density matrix is (I/2) for a qubit. So this must be a maximally mixed state, which means the qubit is in a completely uncertain state between |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I recall that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation used in quantum mechanics to visualize qubit states. For a pure state, it's a point on the surface of the sphere. But for mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector that determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere. The vector r has components (x, y, z), and its magnitude determines how mixed the state is. When r is zero, the state is maximally mixed, which aligns with what I have here.

Let me break it down. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, if I expand ρ, it becomes:

ρ = (1/2)(I + 0.0 σ_x + 0.0 σ_y + (2*(1/2)) σ_z )?

Wait, no, wait. Let me try to express the given ρ in terms of I and the Pauli matrices.

Given that ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = (1/2)I. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix for a qubit. So ρ = (1/2) I.

Comparing this with the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, we can set
