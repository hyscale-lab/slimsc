Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I've heard about this method before. Let me think about what I remember. Radial velocity detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, right? So the star moves a little because the planet's orbiting it.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. They used the RV method to detect them.

The data given is about the periodic shift in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is the Doppler shift and how it relates to the star's velocity. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The formula I recall is K = (v * sin i) / c, where v is the star's velocity. But wait, the actual formula for the RV method involves the mass of the planet and the star, and the orbital period.

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * (1/(2π)) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. Since M_p is Neptune-sized, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like), M_p<<M_star so M_star+M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

I think the simplified formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 - e
