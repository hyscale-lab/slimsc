Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Hmm, right. So this sounds like an electrostatic potential energy problem. The energy of a system of charges is usually calculated using the formula for potential energy between point charges. Since the system is isolated, I think all the charges are fixed in their positions except the one that's moving? Wait, no, the 13th is fixed at P, but the others are fixed at 2m from P. So the setup is that there's a central charge at P, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere of radius 2m around it?

Wait, but the problem says "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So each of the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps I need to arrange the charges in such a way that the potential energy is minimized. But wait, since the charges are identical and all the 12 are fixed at radius 2m, the only moving part is the 13th at P. But no, the 13th is fixed. So the configuration is fixed as 12 charges at 2m and one at P. So the only possible potential is between the 13th and each of the 12, and between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the charges are 2e each. So each has twice the elementary charge. So each charge is +2e? Or could be negative, but since it's identical, they're all same sign.

Wait, but same sign charges repel. So the potential energy between them would be positive, which would make the total potential energy positive. But the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the minimum energy is the potential energy of the entire configuration.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? Let me think. The potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for a system of N charges, it's (1/2) * sum over all pairs of (k * q_i q_j)/r_ij. But in this case, some charges are at the same position, but wait no, wait. The 13th is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So the 12 charges are all at 2m from P. But are they arranged in some way around P?

Wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement. So perhaps they are all located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, centered at P. But the 13th is at the center, so the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2m.
