Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

Let me start by writing down the given density matrix. It's ρ equals (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this looks familiar. Oh right! This is a density matrix that represents a completely mixed state for a qubit. Because when you have equal probabilities for the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, it's like a classical mixture, not a quantum superposition.

So in the Bloch sphere representation, which is the geometrical space for qubits, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state can be written as |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture of such states.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute ρ squared to see if it's a pure state. ρ squared would be [ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2 ]^2. Expanding that, each term would square to itself because |0⟩⟨0| squared is |0⟩⟨0|. The cross terms would be (|0⟩⟨0||1⟩⟨1|)/4 and vice versa. But when adding them up, I think they cancel out because |0⟩⟨0||1⟩⟨1| is zero when multiplied because the bra and ket don't match. So ρ² is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is the same as ρ. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, that would make ρ² = ρ only if the cross terms are zero. Let me compute this properly. 

Wait, when you multiply (|0><0| + |1><1|) by itself, you get |0><0|0><0| + |0><0|1><1| + |1><1|0><0| + |1><1|1><1|. The first and last terms are |0><0| and |1><1| respectively. The middle two terms are |0><1| and |1><0|, but when multiplied by 1/2 each, perhaps? Let me see:

Actually, the correct expansion is (1/2)^2 times each term. So when you square (|0><0| + |1><1|), you get |0><0||0><0| which is |0><0|, and similarly for the others. So:

(|0><0| + |1><1|)^2 = |0><0| + |0><1| + |1><0| + |1><1|.

So ρ squared is (1/2^2)(those terms). So ρ squared is (|0><0| + |1><1| + |0><
