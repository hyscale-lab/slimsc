Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a star with some specific characteristics. When the star doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii, and mass is 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. This ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in LTE, so we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. Wait, no. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) is given, and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower. 

Wait, let me think. The ratio without spots is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. Because the ratio decreases, the factor would be greater than 1.

So, let's write the ratios. Let me denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (with spots). The ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no. Let me get the equation right. 

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So, when the temperature decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making the ratio n1/n2 larger. Wait, but wait: when temperature decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes a larger number if E2 > E1, because T is in the denominator.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K), so T decreases. So (n1/n2) increases because the exponent increases. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I got the levels wrong.

Wait a second, perhaps I should think about the energy difference. Let me assume that level
