Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charge. Alright, let's break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.602e-19 C, which is 3.204e-19 C. Wait, but I should probably keep it symbolic for now and plug in the numbers later to avoid confusion.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, I'm picturing point P with one charge, and then 12 charges arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters each. But wait, how are these 12 charges arranged? Are they equally spaced around P, maybe forming a sphere or something? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the arrangement, but since it's asking for the minimum energy, I think I need to consider the configuration that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, potential energy in an electrostatic system... right, the potential energy depends on the arrangement of the charges. For a system of point charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions against the electric field created by the others.

But wait, since all the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically at the same distance from P,
