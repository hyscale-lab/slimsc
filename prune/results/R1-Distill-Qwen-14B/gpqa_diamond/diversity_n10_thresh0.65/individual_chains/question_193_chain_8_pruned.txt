Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think. Parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), or something like that. So distance r would be 1/plx, I think.

The number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N proportional to (r)^5, because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. Wait, no, let me double-check. So if plx is 1/r, then 1/(plx)^5 becomes (r)^5. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, no: plx is approximately 1/(distance in parsecs). So distance r is related to plx by r ≈ 1/plx. So, plx ≈ 1/r.

So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is the same as (1/(1/r))^5 = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range, so
