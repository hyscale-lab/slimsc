Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars, let's call it N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Wait, wait. Parallax and distance are related. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So, plx is in parsecs, I think. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

So, given that N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, let me write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So substituting that into N's expression, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 → which is N ∝ d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, taking reciprocal gives d^5.

Wait wait, no, wait: N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the distance to the fifth power.

But wait, the question is about how the
