Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. But this question is about the relativistic case, which means I have to consider special relativity effects, probably involving the speed of light c.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A through D, each with different formulas. I need to figure out the correct expression.

First, let's think about the basic harmonic oscillator. In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So at maximum speed, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv², leading to v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistically, the momentum and energy are different. The total energy in relativity is gamma * mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does this fit into the harmonic oscillator scenario?

In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy would be the sum of potential and kinetic. But wait, actually, in the relativistic oscillator, the total energy is a combination of rest mass energy and the vibrational energy.

Wait, another approach: maybe we can model the motion using the relativistic equation of motion. The force from Hooke's law is F = -kx. Newton's second law relativistically is F = d(momentum)/dt. Momentum is gamma mv, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So F = d/dt (gamma mv). But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about energy conservation. The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. That's similar to the classical case, but with relativistic expressions.

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the vibrational energy. At maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential, and at maximum speed (
