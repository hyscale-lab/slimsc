Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photons. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is made of atoms X and Y, with masses given as Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. 

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. Now, the question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, the transitions involve both rotational and vibrational energy changes. But in the quantum rotation-vibration model, for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the question specifies the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0 for vibrations, and the ground rotational state, which is J=0 for rotation.

Wait, no, wait. The fundamental vibrational state is n=0. But the rotational states are quantized with J=0,1,2,... So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, perhaps that refers to the vibrational state, but the rotational state could be in any J. Wait, but the question says 'fundamental state' in general. Maybe it's the lowest energy state overall, which would be n=0 and J=0.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state. The next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so the lowest energy transition would be the one with the least photon energy required. So which transition has lower energy: vibrational or rotational?

Hmm, vibrational transitions usually have higher energy than rotational because the vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely (wait no, wait, wait: the vibrational energy spacing is actually larger than rotational because the vibrational frequency is higher). Because the vibrational frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is in the visible or near UV range, probably higher than rotational transitions, which are typically in the microwave or infrared.

Wait, no, rotational transitions
