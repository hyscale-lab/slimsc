Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms in stars, it's related to the thermal energy of the photosphere, and I think this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium, which I guess applies here since it's stated that the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

So the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given, 1.38e-23 J. I think the key here is to relate the excitation ratio to the temperatures of the two stars.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) )

In this case, the energy difference is E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call E the energy difference between the two levels. So for star 1, the excitation level is twice that of star 2. Let me denote the ratio of the excited states as 2 for star 1 compared to star 2. So, n1/n2 = 2. But wait, wait. The problem says the excited level (n) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So maybe I should consider the ratio as n1 = 2 * n2?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the number of atoms in that excited state is twice that of star_2. So for the same energy levels, n1 is twice n2.

So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. But according to the Boltzmann factor, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) )

Assuming that the two energy levels have the same statistical weight, or that g_i/g_j is the same for both stars. Wait, no—actually, g_i and g_j are the degeneracies of the energy levels. If it's the same energy transition for both stars, then the ratio g_i/g_j would be the same for both. So maybe that term is a constant and can be factored out, or perhaps it's 1 if
