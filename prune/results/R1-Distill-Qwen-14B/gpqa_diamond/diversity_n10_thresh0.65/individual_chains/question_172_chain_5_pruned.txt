Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, not exactly twice the energy, but their excitation is higher. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, since the energy difference is given, and the excitation level is twice as high in star_1, maybe that ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Or wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the population in the excited state is higher. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps it's that the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2 for the same energy level. Or maybe the excitation potential is higher. Hmm, I need to parse this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1, meaning that more atoms are in the higher energy level. So for the same energy level, the population is higher. Wait, but the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the energy difference is between the considered energy levels. So E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that delta E.

In star_1, the population ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is twice that of star_2. Or wait, no. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's that n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2.

So ratio_1 = 2 ratio_2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, ratio = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - delta E / (k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, which I think they are because they're the same element, same energy levels. So the only difference comes from the exponential term.

So for star_1: ratio_1 = exp( -delta E/(k T1) )
And for star_2: ratio_2 = exp( -delta E/(k T2) )

Wait, no, wait the ratio is n_upper/n_lower. So for the same transition, higher temperature would cause more excitation, meaning ratio increases. So if star_1 has a higher ratio, then its temperature is higher than star_2.

But the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that in star_2. So ratio_1 = 2 ratio_2.

So:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) - delta E/(k T2 )

Hmm, let's rearrange this.

Bring the delta E/(k T2) to the left:

- delta E/(k T1) + delta E/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out delta
