Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Okay, the question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. The molecule is 1,3-dibromo, meaning there are Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases like KOH, elimination reactions can occur. So, probably an E2 mechanism here. Since it's a dihalide, heating with a base would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR of product 1 shows some specific signals, and there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. Oh, wait, but elimination would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination isn't the main reaction. Another possibility: if you have two adjacent bromines, perhaps an elimination followed by a rearrangement? Or maybe a Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann is for amines. Wait, wait—another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a diene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a double bond, but if the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridge, perhaps forming a ketone through some rearrangement.

Wait, another angle: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on a bridgehead, maybe when they eliminate, they form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed because of Bredt's rule. So that can't be. So perhaps instead, the base does something else. Oh! Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But for that, the structure would need to be such that substitution is possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex process.

Wait, another thought: 1
