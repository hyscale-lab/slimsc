Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution has a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, right? And the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Yeah, that's right. So the problem is probably about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.

The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant K is given. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, so the reaction is:

Ca²+ (aq) + EDTA^4- (aq) ↔ CaEDTA^2- (aq)

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this problem, the complex is already present at 0.02 M. So the dissociation will be such that some of it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up an ICE table. The initial concentrations would be: [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both 0. Because the complex is initially there, so all the Ca and EDTA are tied up in the complex.

Change: Let x be the amount that dissociates. So, [CaEDTA^2-] decreases by x, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] each increase by x.

So at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small, right? Because K is 5e10, which is a big number, so the reaction doesn't dissociate much. So x is small compared to 0.02, so approximation is okay.)

Then, the equilibrium expression becomes:

K =
