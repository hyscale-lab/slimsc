Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, the options given are A to D, each with two pH values. So I need to calculate both pH values.

First, let's think about the initial solution after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases, which would lower the degree of ionization. But since it's a weak acid, the pH won't drop too much, but I'm not sure exactly how much.

When you mix equal volumes of the acetic acid and water, the concentration halves. So the initial concentration is 0.05 M. Mixing with equal volume (20 cm³ each) would make the new concentration 0.025 M. Because concentration is moles/volume. Since volume doubles, concentration halves.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Wait, how do I calculate that?

Wait, let's think in terms of moles. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

The diluted volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Initial concentration is 0.025 M. So moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted are 0.00025 mol, because the reaction is 1:1.

So after reaction, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point? Well, initially, the solution was 40 cm³, and then we've added NaOH solution. But wait, the problem says "25% titration"—does that mean 25% of the volume required to reach equivalence, or 25% of the moles? I think it's moles, because in titration, the percentage is usually by the amount of substance.

Wait, but to find out the volume of NaOH added, I can calculate how much volume of 0.1 M NaOH would give 0.00025 mol.

Molarity = moles / volume (L). So volume = moles / Molarity.

So volume NaOH = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So the total solution volume after adding 2.5 cm³ is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Now, the concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- in this solution are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I can approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.736 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733? Wait, wait. Let's compute it accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's see, log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa ≈4.73.

So for 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) → (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253.

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 4
