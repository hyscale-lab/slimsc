Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's about. Oh, right, it's about the electric field outside a charged spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm.

So the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both L and l are larger than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So I remember that conductors have some electrostatic properties. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, any charge placed inside would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but in this case, the charge is inside the cavity. So normally, if you have a conductor with a cavity and a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface would remain neutral because the conductor itself was uncharged. Wait, no, I think the induced charge on the inner surface would be -q, and since the conductor is uncharged, the outer surface would also have zero charge. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance, wait, no, wait a second. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The conductor is initially neutral. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the charges in the conductor rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) would have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q attracts negative charges. Then, since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the total charge of the conductor is zero: inner surface is -q, so outer surface must be +q. Or wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So if the inner surface has a charge of -q, then the outer surface must have +q so that the sum is zero? Wait no, that's not right. Because conductor's initial charge is zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would
