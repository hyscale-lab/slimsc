Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The problem involves several reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, there are three products formed through different reactions, and ultimately, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3. The specific question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

First, I need to understand each step of the reaction to figure out what's happening structurally. Let's break it down.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). There's also an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo in adamantane) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. This is called dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (vicinal), eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond. 

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Wait, wait, no. Hold on: the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So each carbon in adamantane is connected to three others. The 1 and 3 positions—if they are on adjacent carbons, that would be vicinal, but I'm a bit confused about the structure. Wait, perhaps 1 and 3 are not adjacent but are separated by some carbons. Hmm, maybe that doesn't matter for the reaction. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps not. Because when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if the bromines are on non-adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination can't happen. Wait, no, that would be the case only if they are vicinal. Oh, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if the two bromines are on the same face
