Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we've got ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting. When they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex number. Oh wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but when calculating probabilities, we take the modulus squared of the wave function. So the probability density is |ψ|^2.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given only in a part of space where the particle can exist, between x=1 and x=3. So I think the wave function is zero outside this interval, but within this interval, it's the given function. Or maybe the wave function is zero outside, but the given function is the one within x=1 to x=3.

Wait, the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps this is the function in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), and zero elsewhere. Hmm, but wait, the wave function being zero elsewhere would make it a valid function. But wait, the problem says that when they measured the positions, all were found between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, actually, the way the question is worded, the wave function is that in the part of space where the particle can exist. So that part is x between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero outside this region. Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in this region, but in that region it's given by that function.

But looking at the wave function: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex function, which is fine. But when considering normalization, the integral of |ψ|^2 over all space must equal 1.

So the task is to find the value of 'a' such that the wave function is normalized. Because the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, the integral for normalization will be from 1 to 3.

So let's set up the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1.

Wait, but ψ is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So let me compute |ψ|².

ψ = a/(sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

So |ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, because when you compute the modulus squared of a complex number a+ib, it's a² + b². So yes, (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

So the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So we can split this into two integrals:

Integral from 1 to 3 of a²/(1+x) dx + integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(x+1) dx is ln(x+1). So a² [ ln(3+1) - ln(1+1) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.85.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Hmm, that's one of the choices. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

The wave function is ψ = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Compute |ψ|²: [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, correct.

Integral from 1 to 3: [a² ln(4/2)] + 0.25*(2) = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1, so a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Yes, so a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.7213.

Square root: √0.7213 ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function. The wave function is:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and it is valid only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval equals 1. The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:

   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
