Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy EX = 8 GeV, mass mX = 1.2 GeV, and width ΓX = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (Lorentz factor) multiplied by the velocity. Oh right, the mean proper lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert that properly.

Wait, units are tricky here. Let me jot down what I know:

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV)

The lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV equals (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me calculate that:

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approx 2.056875e-25 s. Wait, wait no: 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah, that's right.

But wait, that's the proper lifetime. To get the actual lifetime experienced in the lab frame, we need to consider time dilation. The particle is moving relativistically, so we have to multiply by gamma (γ) which is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma γ is E / (m c²), but since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to compute it as γ = EX / mX. Because when E is the total energy, and mX is rest mass, then γ = E/mc², and c is in units where it's factored into the energy terms. Wait, but in natural units (where c=1), energy E in GeV equals mass times c², so in that case, γ = E / m.

So EX is 8 GeV, mX is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6
