Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Let me think through this.

First, the question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period means it's orbiting more quickly, right? Like Mercury has a short orbital period compared to Jupiter.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd because more massive stars are usually larger, but here they have the same radius. Maybe one is more evolved, but the question says both have circular orbits and the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. Oh, wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, which might mean it's a subgiant or something, but their radii are the same. So R1 = R2.

Now, transit probability. I recall that the probability P is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² times (a / R_star), where 'a' is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, actually, the approximate formula for transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/R_s)) ), but I might be mixing things up. Wait, no, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a * sin i)), but since we're talking about the probability of transit, and assuming random orientation, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), but wait, no, wait. Let me get this right.

The probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The geometric probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but when R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately (R_p / a) * (R_s / R_p) )? Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing the terms.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the geometric probability (which is the main factor, assuming the planet's orbit is randomly oriented relative to our line of sight) is (R_p + R_s) / a. Because the planet needs to pass in front of the star. So for a given star, a planet with a smaller orbital distance 'a' (semi-major axis) has a higher chance of transiting because 'a' is smaller, making the denominator smaller, so the probability increases.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. So if 'a' is smaller, the probability is higher. So for the same star, a planet closer in has a higher chance to transit.

In this problem, the two stars have the same radius. So R1 = R
