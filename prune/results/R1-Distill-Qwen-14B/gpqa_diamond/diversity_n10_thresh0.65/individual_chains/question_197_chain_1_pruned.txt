Okay, so I need to figure out what Compound X is and what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by looking at the IR and NMR data given.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which fits with the 3400–2500 cm-1. So maybe Compound X has a carboxylic acid group.

The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the aromatic region, so that confirms the presence of a benzene ring. Those peaks are probably due to the stretching of the C=C bonds.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's quite downfield, so it's likely an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. So the compound has a -COOH group.

The next peak at 8.0 ppm is a doublet (d) integrating for 2H. That's probably aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene. Then 7.2 ppm is another doublet (d) for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but both are doublets? So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause the two sets of doublets. Or perhaps it's a substituent with ortho and para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a disubstituted ring with substituents in positions that cause this splitting.

Then, 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 1H. That's probably a methine proton attached to something, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (m) for 2H could be next to a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (d) for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH that's next to another group. The 0.9 ppm triplet (t) for 3H is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a substituted benzoic acid. Let me try to visualize it. The benzoic acid would have the COOH group. The substituents on the benzene ring would be a methyl group and another substituent. Let's see: the NMR shows two sets of doublets in the aromatic region, which suggests substitution in the para positions, but wait, no, because if it's para to each other, each set would be a singlet. Hmm, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in a position that causes the splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that would cause different splitting.

Wait, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm. Let me think about substitution patterns. If the ring has two substituents in the para positions, then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. For example, if it's a para-substituted benzene, and each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. But wait, perhaps the aromatic protons are adjacent to substituents. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and another group, like a propionyl group, attached to the benzene ring. Let me think: the COOH is at position 4, and other substituents are at position 1 and 3? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me try to sketch the possible structure. The benzoic acid has a COOH group. Let's say it's at position 4. Then, at position 1 (para to the COOH), perhaps there's a substituent
