Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. But wait, no, wait. Parallax is usually defined as the angle in arcseconds, and the distance r in parsecs is r = 1 / plx. So if plx increases, the distance decreases. Got it.

The question says the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I want to express this in terms of distance r. Since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that in.

So 1/plx is r. Therefore, 1/plx^5 would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, that's not right. Let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/r, then 1/(plx^5) is (1/(1/r))^5 = (r)^5. So yes, N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. So perhaps I'm not just looking for the proportionality, but the change. Maybe this is about differential number with respect to r.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The number of stars as a function of distance. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be the number in that shell. So if N is the number of stars in a small range dr, then N is proportional to 4π r² times the volume element, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Because that's when the number density is constant. But here, the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5, so N varies as r^5. But that's the count per unit volume or per some other measure? Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait, let's make this more precise. The number of stars in a given region is a function of distance. So if N is the number of stars, and it's proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, that can't be right. Because when you're looking at a region of the sky, the number of stars you count depends on how many there are in that volume. But parallax relates to distance. So if you have a group of stars, the more distant they are, the lower their parallax. So when you observe a region, you can see more stars that are closer because their parallax is higher, but if the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, that's the same as r^5.

Wait, but the number of stars per unit distance? Oh, right, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So it's about the number density in terms of distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be N dr? Or is it proportional to r^5 multiplied by something else?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number. So the number of stars in a small distance dr around r would be proportional to r^5 multiplied by the area over which you're counting, but the question is about per unit range of distance. So perhaps the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but that might be if N is the total number up to a distance r. But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So perhaps the number per unit distance is dN/dr.

Wait, let's model N as a function of r. Suppose N(r) is the number of stars per unit volume. Then, the number in a thin shell between r and r + dr is N(r) * 4π r² dr. But if N(r) is proportional to r^5, then the number in the shell would be proportional to r^5 * r² = r^7. But that's the number in a shell, not the number density.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, that's N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So that's like the number per unit distance. So dN/dr would be the change in number per unit distance. But wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell (per unit distance) as a function of r.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a given region of the sky (like a small solid angle) as a function of distance. So for a fixed area on the sky, the number of stars at a distance r is N(r) = k * r^5, where k is a constant.

Wait, but no, because in reality, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. Wait, but maybe the question is assuming that the number per unit volume is a function of r. So the number density is N(r) = k * r^5.

But if that's the case, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr at distance r would be N(r) * 4π r² dr. Because the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. So substituting N(r) = k r^5, the number is 4π k r^7 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) would be proportional to r^7. But that's not one of the options. The options are r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5.

Wait, but the question might not be considering the volume. It says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So if N ∝ r^5, then the number per unit distance would be the derivative dN/dr. Wait, no, because N is the total number in the region, perhaps. Or maybe N is the number per unit volume, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. The number of stars in a region of the sky (so a fixed solid angle) at a distance r is given by N = k * r^5. Then, the number of stars per unit distance (per unit r) would be dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So that would be proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So it's the number per unit distance. So it's dN/dr.

Wait, but if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So per unit r, the number increases as r^4.

So looking back at the options, option C is ~ r^4.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5 as you go further away. But the question is about the change per unit distance. So the change in N per unit change in r is dN/dr. So if N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

So the correct answer should be option C, ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), which represents the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
