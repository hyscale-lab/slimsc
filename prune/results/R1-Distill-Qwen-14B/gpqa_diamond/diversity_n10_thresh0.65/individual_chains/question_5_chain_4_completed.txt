Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics can be represented by matrices, and eigenvectors are found by solving (P - λI)|v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, but the operator P is along the arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but in x-z. That means the direction is determined by angles theta and phi, but since it's in x-z plane, phi is zero? Or perhaps phi is 90 degrees? Wait, usually, in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle phi is measured from the x-axis, so if the direction is in x-z plane, phi is 0 or 180, but more generally, it can be any angle in that plane, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is expressed as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but if it's in x-z plane, then φ is either 0 or 90? Wait, no, the x-z plane is when y=0, so φ can be 0 or 180. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the operator P is along a direction n, which is some combination of x and z, so I'll have to express P in terms of its components along n.

Wait, the operator P is given for each component. So I think the operator along direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y =0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But the problem says it lies along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector. So I need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Express the operator P as a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z, but since n is in x-z, P_y's coefficient is zero. So P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

2. Substitute the given matrices for P_x and P_z. Let's compute P.

3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So we're to find the eigenvector associated with that eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to compute the matrix for P first.

Let me compute P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Substituting the given matrices:

P = n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So combining these, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because:

Top-left: n_z * (1) + n_x * (0) = n_z

Top-right: n_x * (1) + n_z * (0) = n_x

Bottom-left: n_x * (1) + n_z * (0) = n_x

Bottom-right: n_z * (-1) + n_x * (0) = -n_z

Wait, no. Wait, P is a sum of two matrices. Let me do it step by step.

P = (n_x * (ħ/2)) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * (ħ/2)) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So each term is multiplied by the respective factor.

So the matrix elements:

Top-left: (n_x * 0 * ħ/2) + (n_z * 1 * ħ/2) → (ħ/2) n_z

Top-right: (n_x * 1 * ħ/2) + (n_z * 0 * ħ/2) → (ħ/2) n_x

Bottom-left: same as top-right → (ħ/2) n_x

Bottom-right: (n_x * 0 * ħ/2) + (n_z * (-1) * ħ/2) → (-ħ/2) n_z

So the matrix P is:

[ [ (ħ/2) n_z, (ħ/2) n_x ],
  [ (ħ/2) n_x, -(ħ/2) n_z ] ]

So, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, we solve (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So, the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) is:

[ (ħ/2 n_z - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 n_x ) ]
[ (ħ/2 n_x ), ( -ħ/2 n_z - ħ/2 ) ]

Which can be written as:

ħ/2 [ (n_z - 1), n_x ]
      [ n_x, -(n_z + 1) ]

So the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 ]
        [ n_x v1 - (n_z + 1) v2 = 0 ]

Dividing both equations by ħ/2 (since it's non-zero), we get:

(n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
n_x v1 - (n_z + 1) v2 = 0

Let me write these as two equations:

1) (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

2) n_x v1 - (n_z + 1) v2 = 0

Assuming v is non-zero, we can look for non-trivial solutions.

Let me write equation 1 as:

v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

Similarly, equation 2:

n_x v1 = (n_z + 1) v2 → v1 = [ (n_z +1) v2 ] / n_x

Setting the two expressions for v1 equal:

[ -n_x v2 ]/(n_z -1 ) = [ (n_z +1) v2 ] / n_x

Assuming v2 ≠ 0, we can cancel v2 and multiply both sides by (n_z -1) n_x:

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 )

Wait, (n_z +1)(n_z -1 ) = n_z^2 -1.

So:

- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1

Wait, but since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So this equation holds. So it doesn't give any new information, which means the two equations are dependent.

Thus, the system has a non-trivial solution, and we can choose one variable in terms of the other.

Let me proceed with equation 1: v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

Let me express v1 in terms of v2.

But to make it easier, perhaps express the ratio v1/v2.

v1/v2 = [ -n_x ] / (n_z - 1 )

Let me denote this ratio as k. So v1 = k v2.

Let me express v in terms of v2. Let me set v2 = 1 (for simplicity, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple), and find v1.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express the components in terms of parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression in terms of the angles.

Wait, the direction vector n is in x-z plane. So it can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming the spherical coordinate system where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So equation 1: (cosθ -1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ v1 - (cosθ +1 ) v2 = 0.

Let me take equation 1:

v1 = [ -sinθ / ( cosθ -1 ) ] v2

Simplify denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ ) → numerator: - sinθ

So v1 = [ - sinθ / ( -(1 - cosθ) ) ] v2 → v1 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] v2.

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

v1 = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] v2

Simplify:

= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] v2 = cot(θ/2) v2.

So the ratio v1/v2 = cot(θ/2).

So, let me set v2 = sin(θ/2), then v1 = cos(θ/2).

Wait, because cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2). So if v2 = sin(θ/2), then v1 = cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But wait, are there any phase factors to consider? Because quantum mechanics allows for global phase factors, but eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar multiple.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

But wait, the options are presented as the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So we need to ensure the vector is normalized.

Let me calculate the normalization. The sum of squares of the components:

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = |cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 = 1.

Because cos^2 + sin^2 = 1.

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and option D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar.

Wait, but let's think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the vector. The operator P is along n, which is in x-z. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator along a direction n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The eigenstate with +ħ/2 would be along n, and the other is opposite.

So the eigenvector should correspond to the state |+n> which is a spin-up state along n.

The spin-up state along n is given by the vector:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But wait, in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0. Because in spherical coordinates, if the direction is in x-z, then the azimuthal angle phi is zero. Because phi is measured from the x-axis in the x-y plane; but if the vector is in x-z, it's either along x or z.

Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, the x-z plane could have any azimuthal angle, but phi is measured in the x-y plane. So if the vector is in x-z plane, then phi is either 0 or pi, depending on the direction. Wait, perhaps phi can be any angle, but in this case, since the direction is in x-z, phi is 0 or something else? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how the eigenvector is defined.

Wait, the general spin-up state along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by:

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

Where theta is the polar angle, and phi is the azimuthal angle.

But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane. So the vector lies in x-z, so n_y =0. So the direction is (sin(theta) cos(phi), 0, sin(theta) sin(phi)) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should parameterize the direction correctly. The direction n is in x-z plane, which implies that the vector has zero y-component. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

In spherical coordinates, n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi), n_z = sin(theta) sin(phi), and n_y=0.

Wait, no, that can't be right because for a unit vector, n_x = cos(theta) * cos(phi), n_y = cos(theta) * sin(phi), n_z = sin(theta). Oh wait, perhaps it's better to use another convention.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the conventions. Let me define the spherical coordinates as:

n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi)

n_y = sin(theta) sin(phi)

n_z = cos(theta)

But then, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then phi is either 0 or pi, because that's where y=0.

So in that case, phi is 0 or pi. So in that case, the spin-up state would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But since phi is either 0 or pi, the second component becomes either sin(theta/2) or - sin(theta/2).

Wait, but let's think about the eigenvector I found earlier: [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But according to the general formula, it's [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

So in the x-z plane, phi is either 0, pi, etc. So e^{i phi} could be 1 or -1.

But in the options, option C is exactly [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which matches for phi=0. But what if phi is pi? Then the second component would be negative: [cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, another approach: since the operator P is along the x-z plane, the eigenvectors will depend on theta, the angle between n and the z-axis.

In the case where n is aligned along the z-axis (theta=0), the eigenvector is [0,1], because P_z would have eigenvalues + and - ħ/2. So the +ħ/2 eigenstate is [0,1].

Similarly, when n is along the x-axis (theta=pi/2, phi=0), the eigenvector should be [1,0].

Wait, but according to the spin-up state formula, when theta=0, phi=0, the state is [1,0], which is correct. When theta=pi/2, phi=0, the state is [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)] = [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which makes sense for the x-direction eigenstate.

But in the earlier calculation, I found that the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, that seems to fit these examples. Let's check.

When theta=0: [1, 0] → correct.

When theta=pi/2: [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)] = [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], correct.

So the general expression is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But wait, if n is in the x-z plane, but phi is not zero, like phi=pi. Then the state would be [cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector depends on theta and phi, but in the options, only option C has theta/2, and option B includes phi.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Ah, so option C is for when phi=0, perhaps. But if the direction is arbitrary, then the correct eigenvector should include phi, making it option B.

Wait, but the given eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector should have a phase factor e^{i phi}.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, when we computed the eigenvector, we found that when n is in the x-z plane (phi=0), the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But what if phi is not zero? For example, if phi = pi, then the eigenvector would be [cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2)].

But in quantum mechanics, the spin state along n is given by:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |+x>

Wait, more accurately, the spin-up state along direction (theta, phi) is:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |→>

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me recall the standard spin state.

The eigenvector for spin in direction (theta, phi) is:

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

So, in the case where phi=0, it's [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But in our problem, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so phi is 0 or pi. So the eigenvector for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches for phi=0, but option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, but our analysis showed that the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), not theta. So option C is the correct one for this case.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the general case should include phi, but the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is twice the angle. Hmm, that's theta, not theta/2.

So that can't be correct.

Option C has theta/2, which matches our analysis.

Wait, but why are the other options presented? Let's see.

Option A: sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. Why hbar? Because the eigenvector elements are often dimensionless; perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc. That includes hbar, but eigenvectors are dimensionless, so perhaps this is a distractor.

Wait, but the problem says, "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

So the eigenvector is a unit vector. So the elements should have magnitude squared summing to 1.

Looking at option C: cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Their squares sum to 1, so it's normalized. That seems correct.

Option B: cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). The squares sum to cos²(theta) + sin²(theta) = 1. So it's also normalized.

But why is there a discrepancy between the two?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the initial setup: the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So, when I found the eigenvector, I found it as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], assuming n_x and n_z are in terms of theta.

Wait, but n_x and n_z could be expressed in terms of theta and phi. So perhaps I should have considered phi in the initial steps. Let me try that.

Wait, earlier, I expressed n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi), n_z = sin(theta) sin(phi). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, if n is in x-z plane, then the spherical coordinates would have n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi), n_z = sin(theta) sin(phi), and n_y=0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the correct parameterization. Let me recheck.

In spherical coordinates, the unit vector is:

n = [ sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta) ]

But wait, this is for the standard convention where theta is the polar angle from the positive z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane.

But if our direction is in the x-z plane, then phi must be 0 or pi. Because in the x-z plane, the vector lies either in the positive x and positive z direction (phi=0) or negative x and positive z (phi=pi), or something like that.

Wait, no. Let me take phi=0, which would place the vector in the x-z plane.

Wait, no, wait. If phi is the angle around the z-axis, then phi=0 would point along the positive x-axis. If theta is 0, it's along positive z. So for a vector in the x-z plane, phi can be 0 or pi (along negative x), but theta can vary.

Wait, perhaps another way: any vector in the x-z plane can be represented as (a,0,b), with a² + b² =1. So a = sin(theta) cos(phi), b= sin(theta) sin(phi) ?

No, wait, in standard spherical coordinates, a vector is (r=1) has coordinates:

x = sin(theta) cos(phi)
y = sin(theta) sin(phi)
z = cos(theta)

So, for a vector in the x-z plane, y=0 → sin(theta) sin(phi) =0 → phi=0 or pi, or theta=0.

So, if the vector is in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi.

So, the eigenvector in terms of theta and phi would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

So, if phi is 0, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

If phi is pi, it's [ cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2) ].

So, the general form is option B, which includes phi.

But looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which has theta, not theta/2.

So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me retrace.

Wait, in the step where I computed the eigenvector, I found that the ratio v1/v2 = cot(theta/2). So, v1 = cos(theta/2), v2= sin(theta/2), assuming v2 is real. But if we include the phase factor, it's e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

Wait, but in the eigenvalue equation, I set v2=1, but perhaps there's a phase factor involved. Let me think about the operator P again.

Wait, the operator P is given as a combination of Pauli matrices. So the eigenstates are related to the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices. The eigenvectors of the spin operator along direction n are given by the spin-up and spin-down states, which involve e^{i phi/2} factors.

Wait, perhaps I need to include the phase factor correctly.

Wait, in our case, the eigenvector for spin-up along n is:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |→>

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Let me think in terms of the spin matrices.

The eigenstates of the spin operator along direction (theta, phi) are:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

|-> = [ -e^{-i phi} sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, I think it's more accurate that the spin-up state along direction (theta, phi) is:

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

So yes, the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So, looking back at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is twice the angle. So that's incorrect.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct when phi=0.

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so phi can be 0 or pi. So the general eigenvector would have the e^{i phi} factor.

Looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's theta, not theta/2. So it doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the eigenvector. Let me recheck.

We had the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) as:

(ħ/2) [ (n_z -1), n_x ]

          [n_x, -(n_z +1) ]

So, the equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

n_x v1 - (n_z +1) v2 =0

We found the ratio v1/v2 = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

But, substituting n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, n_x and n_z in terms of theta and phi:

Wait, n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z).

So, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Expressed in spherical coordinates, with theta as the polar angle (angle from z-axis), phi as the azimuthal angle (in x-y plane), but since we're in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different parameterization. Let me express the direction as:

n_x = sin(theta) 

n_z = cos(theta)

Because in the x-z plane, the angle theta is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So when theta=0, it's along x, theta=90 degrees is along z.

Wait, that might make more sense.

So, n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So, substituting into the ratio v1/v2 = [ -n_x ] / (n_z -1 )

v1/v2 = [ - sin(theta) ] / ( cos(theta) -1 )

Let me simplify this:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1):

v1/v2 = [ sin(theta) ] / ( 1 - cos(theta) )

We can write 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

v1/v2 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ] 

= [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

= cot(theta/2 )

So, v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Thus, v1 = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] v2.

Let me set v2 = sin(theta/2) e^{i phi}, then v1 = cos(theta/2) e^{i phi}.

Wait, but why the phase factor e^{i phi}? Because when the direction is at an angle phi in the x-z plane, the eigenvector should have a phase related to phi.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, the eigenvector's second component has e^{i phi} because of the spin state. So perhaps I should include that.

So, the eigenvector is:

v1 = cos(theta/2) e^{i phi}

v2 = sin(theta/2) e^{i phi}

Wait, but then the ratio would be [ cos(theta/2) e^{i phi} ] / [ sin(theta/2) e^{i phi} ] = cot(theta/2), which matches the earlier ratio.

But this would result in v1 = cos(theta/2), v2 = sin(theta/2), since the phase factors e^{i phi} cancel out.

Wait, but that can't be right because the phase depends on phi.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to include the phase correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that in the eigenvector, the second component has a phase factor e^{i phi}.

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option B, except that option B has theta instead of theta/2.

Wait, but none of the options present the theta/2 form with the phase factor.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So, option C is correct only when phi=0.

But the problem states the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so phi could be non-zero. So the correct eigenvector should have the phase factor, which is only present in option B, but with theta instead of theta/2.

Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider another approach. Since the given P is a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z, but P_y is zero because n is in x-z. So, the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the spin operator along an arbitrary axis are given by the spin coherent states, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

The general spin-up state along direction (theta, phi) is:

|+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

Which is what I had earlier. So in the problem, the direction is in x-z plane, which means phi can be 0 or pi, etc., but the eigenvector would have the e^{i phi} term.

But looking at the options, none of them except option B include the phase factor, but it's using theta instead of theta/2.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial calculation without parameterizing in terms of theta and phi.

The eigenvector I found was (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), assuming phi=0.

But the problem is about an arbitrary direction in x-z, so the eigenvector should depend on theta and phi.

Looking at the options, option B is the only one that includes phi, but the theta is not scaled by ½.

Wait, unless I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the eigenvector again.

Wait, from the equations:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 --> equation (1)

n_x v1 - (n_z +1) v2 = 0 --> equation (2)

I can write equation (1) as v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

Equation (2) can be written as v1 = [ (n_z +1) v2 ] / n_x

Setting them equal:

[ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 ) = [ (n_z +1) v2 ] / n_x

Assuming v2 !=0 and n_x !=0,

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 )

→ -n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1

→ n_z^2 + n_x^2 =1

Which holds because n is a unit vector.

Thus, the two equations are consistent, and the ratio is:

v1/v2 = [ (n_z +1) ] / n_x = [ (n_z -1) (-n_x^2) ] / n_x 

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z.

From equation (1): v1= [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

Let me write this as v1 = [n_x v2 ] / (1 - n_z )

So, the eigenvector can be written as [n_x, 1 - n_z ]^T times some constant.

Because if I take v2 = 1 - n_z, then v1 = n_x.

Wait, let's see:

Assume v1 = n_x, v2 = 1 - n_z.

Then, equation (1):

(n_z -1) * n_x + n_x * (1 - n_z ) = n_x (n_z -1 + 1 - n_z ) = 0 → equation holds.

Equation (2):

n_x * n_x - (n_z +1) (1 - n_z ) = n_x^2 - [ (n_z +1)(1 - n_z ) ]

n_x^2 = (1 - n_z^2 )

So,

(1 - n_z^2 ) - [ (1 - n_z^2 ) ] =0 → equation holds.

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x, 1 - n_z ].

But [n_x, 1 - n_z ] may not be normalized.

Let me compute its norm:

n_x² + (1 - n_z )² = n_x² +1 - 2 n_z + n_z².

Since n_x² + n_z² =1,

= (1 - n_z²) +1 - 2 n_z + n_z² = 1 - n_z^2 +1 -2n_z +n_z^2 = 2 - 2 n_z.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2(1 - n_z )).

So the normalized eigenvector is [n_x, 1 - n_z ] / sqrt(2(1 - n_z )).

But n_z = cos(theta), since n is in x-z plane, so theta is the angle from z-axis.

Wait, if n_z = cos(theta), then 1 - n_z = 2 sin²(theta/2).

Thus, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2 * 2 sin²(theta/2)) ) = 1/(2 sin(theta/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector becomes:

[ n_x, 1 - n_z ] * 1/(2 sin(theta/2) )

But n_x = sin(theta), 1 - n_z = 2 sin²(theta/2).

So,

v1 = [ sin(theta) ] / [2 sin(theta/2) ) ] 

v2 = [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) ) ] = sin(theta/2)

Simplify v1:

sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

v1 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) ] = cos(theta/2 )

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Ah, so that's how we get to this conclusion. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, earlier I thought that the eigenvector should have a phase factor e^{i phi}, but according to this derivation, it doesn't. That suggests that perhaps in this specific case, the phase factor is not present.

Wait, but why? Because when n is in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, but in our derivation, the eigenvector didn't include any phase. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption in this derivation was that the direction is in the x-z plane and we ignored the phi dependence, but in reality, the eigenvector would have a phase factor depending on phi.

Wait, perhaps I should rederive this with phi included.

Let me try again, considering that the direction is in x-z plane but allowing for phi.

So, n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi)

n_z = sin(theta) sin(phi)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in spherical coordinates, for a direction in x-z plane, the parameterization would have n_x = cos(theta') and n_z = sin(theta'), where theta' is measured from the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me represent the direction as:

n = (a, 0, b ), with a² + b² =1.

So, a = n_x, b = n_z.

Then, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

But how does that relate to a and b?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about specific examples.

Example 1: n along x-axis. Then theta = 90 degrees (pi/2 radians), phi=0.

n_x=1, n_z=0.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ].

Which is correct because the spin-up state along x is (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2).

Example 2: n along z-axis. Then theta=0, phi=0.

n_x=0, n_z=1.

Eigenvector is [1, 0], which is correct.

Now, if n is along negative x-axis (phi=pi), then the eigenvector would be [ cos(pi/4), - sin(pi/4) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, - sqrt(2)/2 ].

Which is correct because the spin-up along negative x is (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2).

So, in these cases, the eigenvector has the correct phase.

Wait, but in the case of phi= pi, we have n_x = -1, n_z=0.

But according to our earlier derivation, the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

But theta is measured from the z-axis. So when n is along -x, theta would be 90 degrees (pi/2 radians), and phi=pi.

So, [ cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]

But wait, that's not correct because when n is along -x, the eigenvector should have a negative sign in the second component.

Ah, I see the confusion. I think I made a mistake in how theta is defined.

Wait, perhaps theta is measured from the z-axis towards the direction of n. So when n is along the positive x-axis, theta is 90 degrees. When n is along the negative x-axis, theta is 90 degrees as well, but phi is pi.

So, in that case, the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Which for phi=pi, gives [ cos(pi/4), - sin(pi/4) ] → which is correct.

So, the general eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But in the problem, the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so phi can be anything. So the correct eigenvector must include the e^{i phi} term.

Looking back at the options, only option B includes the e^{i phi} term, but it's using theta instead of theta/2.

Wait, but option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is theta, not theta/2.

So none of the options match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct when phi=0.

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary, so phi could be non-zero. So the correct answer should include the phase factor.

But among the options, only option B includes phi, but with theta instead of theta/2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. From the derivation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But wait, in the general case, the eigenvector should have the phase factor e^{i phi}, but option C doesn't include it. So perhaps the answer should be option C when phi=0, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane.

But perhaps the problem assumes phi=0, making option C correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the direction in the x-z plane, but the eigenvector's phase depends on the angle phi.

But none of the options seem to match correctly except option C.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the eigenvector I found earlier doesn't include the phase factor because the direction is in x-z plane and the operator is a real matrix. Wait, no, the operator P includes the Py component which is imaginary, but in our case, since the direction is in x-z, Py is zero, so the operator P is real and Hermitian.

Wait, since P is real and Hermitian, its eigenvectors can be taken as real vectors, which would mean that the phase factor is 1.

But wait, in our earlier analysis, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is real, so the phase factor is 1. But earlier, I thought that if n is in x-z plane with phi=pi, the eigenvector would have a negative sign. But according to the real eigenvector, that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the parameterization of the direction and the phase in the eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the other options are distractors.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, with $P_y = 0$ since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. The operator $\vec{P}$ can thus be expressed as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of the unit vector $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, satisfying $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $P$ becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
(P - \frac{\hbar}{2} I) |v\rangle = 0.
\]

Substituting $P$ and simplifying, the matrix $(P - \frac{\hbar}{2} I)$ becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z - 1 & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z - 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$ (which is non-zero), the equations to solve are:

\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0, \quad n_x v_1 - (n_z + 1)v_2 = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we find:

\[
v_1 = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1} v_2.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation and simplifying, we find that the two equations are consistent, and the eigenvector components are proportional to:

\[
v_1 = \cos(\theta/2), \quad v_2 = \sin(\theta/2),
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle defining the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector is thus:

\[
|v\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
   This is incorrect because the eigenvector components do not match the derived form and include $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent for a normalized eigenvector.

2. **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
   This is incorrect because the components involve $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$, which does not match the derived eigenvector.

3. **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is normalized.

4. **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This is incorrect because it includes $\hbar$, which is dimensionally inconsistent, and the coefficients are not consistent with the derived eigenvector.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
