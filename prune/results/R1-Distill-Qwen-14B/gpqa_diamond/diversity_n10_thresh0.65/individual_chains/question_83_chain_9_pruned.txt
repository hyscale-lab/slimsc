Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Hmm. So, the setup is that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to break this down step by step.

Let me recall some concepts. Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH, and when titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it reacts to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO⁻), and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate ions. The solution would then consist of the sodium acetate in solution, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. This makes the solution basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to produce OH⁻ ions, making the pH greater than 7.

But wait, the question also asks about the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. At that point, the solution would be a buffer solution, containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base. So, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for that part.

Let me plan the steps I need to take.

First, calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence. Then, calculate the pH for both situations.

Step 1: Calculate the diluted acetic acid concentration.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02000 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ or 0.04000 liters.

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol.

After dilution, the new concentration is moles / total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, let me double-check that: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Step 2: Find the equivalence point volume.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.

NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So, volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.0100 L, which is 10.00 cm³.

So, equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So, 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added (since 10 cm³ is 100%, so 25% is 2.5 cm³).

Alternatively, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, 25% of 0.001 mol
