Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that its operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by some high energy scale, usually the Planck scale or something like that.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are options A to D, each a combination of these symmetries.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these symmetries. Let me think. So, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's a bigger group. CP symmetry is charge conjugation combined with parity. And CPT is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal.

In SMEFT, operators are organized dimension by dimension. The Standard Model itself respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT extends that. So, SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model unless there's a reason to break them. So what symmetries does the Standard Model respect?

The Standard Model is invariant under Lorentz symmetry, of course. But wait, does it respect Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare is a bigger symmetry; since the Standard Model includes gauge fields, which are local, maybe it's more about the local symmetries. Wait, but Poincare is about spacetime symmetries, so the SM includes that. So the SMEFT should respect that too.

What about CP and CPT? The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, which is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. But CP symmetry is not exactly respected by the SM because of the CKM matrix and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. So the SM doesn't have CP symmetry. However, if the SMEFT is built as an effective theory, it should respect certain symmetries.

Wait, but when building SMEFT, you can have operators that break some of these symmetries. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, the SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model at the effective level. Or, perhaps, it's more about the symmetries that are present in the Standard Model, which the effective theory would naturally respect unless operators explicitly break them.

Wait, but wait. In the Standard Model, the CPT symmetry is respected. Because all the particles have their antiparticles, and the interactions are such that CPT holds. So SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, should respect CPT. But do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CPT? Or can they violate it?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The SMEFT is built from operators that are invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, but what about other symmetries?

Wait, operators in the SMEFT must be invariant under all the symmetries of the Standard Model, except those that are explicitly broken. So the SM has CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. So, operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM. So, if the SM doesn't have a CP symmetry, the SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP either? Or maybe they can break it.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, any operator in SMEFT must respect the symmetries that the SM respects. Since the SM respects CPT, do the SMEFT operators have to respect CPT? Or can they violate it?

Wait, but the SM includes CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT. Because if they didn't, the effective theory would have a lower symmetry than the SM, which isn't the case. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT.

Wait, but what about Lorentz symmetry and Poincare? The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must respect that as well. What about Poincare? Since Poincare includes translations, maybe the operators have to be local, so they respect Poincare.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether Poincare is automatically respected when building the SMEFT. Because the SMEFT is a field theory, which is built upon the framework of QFT, which respects Poincare. So all terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. Because the Lagrangian itself is a local object, so it must be invariant under spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations.

So, operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

What about CP and CPT? The SM respects CPT, so SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry as well. So option 4 is correct.

But what about CP? The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry (like in the electroweak sector), but the SMEFT might have operators that violate CP. However, the question is about which symmetries must be respected. Since the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry, the SMEFT doesn't have to have all operators respecting CP. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. Therefore, option 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So which option is that? Let's look.

The options are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait about Poincare. Is Poincare symmetry the same as including translations? So the Lagrangian is invariant under Poincare, which includes translations. So yes, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry because the theory is built that way.

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by a high energy scale. These operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model unless explicitly broken. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes invariance under rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. As a field theory, SMEFT is built within the framework of quantum field theory, which inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to phenomena like the CKM matrix and matter-antimatter asymmetry. Since the SMEFT does not need to enforce CP symmetry, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect it.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. As SMEFT is an effective theory of the Standard Model, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
