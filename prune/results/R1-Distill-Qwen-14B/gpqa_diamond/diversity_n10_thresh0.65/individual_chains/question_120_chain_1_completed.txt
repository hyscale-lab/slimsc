Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density in space should be the same in all regions. Wait, uniform distribution here probably means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So more distant regions would have more volume per shell, right?

Let me think in terms of shells. Imagine spherical shells around the Earth, each shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of each shell would be 4πd² dr. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, N ∝ 4πd² dr. But plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that.

So d = 1/plx → dr = -d(1/plx) d plx? Wait, let me clarify. If d =1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, because derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx is -1/plx². So dr = - (dplx) / (plx²).

Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how the number of stars in a thin shell relates to plx.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d is N = n * (volume of shell), where n is the number density of stars. So for each shell at d, volume is 4πd² dr. But dr is the thickness of the shell, which in terms of parallax is dplx? Wait, no. Because plx is 1/d, so for a small change in plx (dplx), the change in d would be dr = -d (dplx) / (d²) )? Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, let's express everything in terms of plx. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. The volume of a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx is approximately 4π (d)^2 dr, where dr is the change in d. But since d = 1/plx, dr is the derivative of d with respect to plx multiplied by dplx. So dr = (d dplx). Let me compute dr.

d = 1/plx → dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since dplx is positive (we're looking at a small range), dr is negative, indicating that d decreases as plx increases. But for the volume, we're interested in the absolute change. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * |dr|.

Substituting dr, |dr| = (1/plx²) dplx. So volume dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, because dr is the change in d, which is ( -1/plx² ) dplx. So the absolute change in d is (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume of the shell between plx and plx + dplx is 4π (d)^2 * dr, where d = 1/plx, and dr is the change in d, which is (1/plx²) dplx.

So dV = 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of stars per unit parallax range. Since the number density n is stars per unit volume, the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV. So for each dplx, the number of stars is n * (4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx) ) → n * (4π / plx^4 ) dplx.

Wait, that would suggest the number of stars per unit dplx is proportional to (1/plx^4). So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is ~ 1/plx^4.

But that's option A. But wait, I might have messed up the terms in the volume calculation. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to that volume. So imagine we have a region of space that's a cylinder (but for simplicity, think in terms of a sphere) at a certain distance. The number of stars would be area * depth. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is number density multiplied by volume.

Wait, considering that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area of the shell times its thickness dr. The surface area is 4πd². So N = n * 4πd² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, substitute that in. So N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr.

Now, dr is the change in d corresponding to a change in plx (dplx). So dr = (dd/dplx) * dplx.

Compute dd/dplx: d = 1/plx → dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since d decreases as plx increases, the absolute change in d is (1/plx²) dplx. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx (since the negative just indicates direction, but for our purposes, we take the magnitude).

Substituting back into N: N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx → N = (4π n) (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit parallax range decreases as plx increases, but more steeply than that.

Wait, but the question is about how the number (per unit plx range) changes with plx. So the number is inversely proportional to plx^4, meaning the number of stars in each unit of plx (like from plx to plx +1) would drop by 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3. Hmm, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check the steps.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the number of stars as a function of parallax. The question is, for a given range of plx (like plx to plx + dplx), how many stars are there?

Number of stars in that range is n (number density) multiplied by the volume of that shell. The volume is 4πr² dr, where r is distance, and dr is the small change in r corresponding to a change dplx in parallax.

Since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx in magnitude.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

Thus, number of stars, N = n * 4π/(plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit dplx is (n *4π)/ (plx^4). So it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, that's option A. So why isn't that correct? But wait, another way to think: the number of stars per unit volume is n, which is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n*dV.

But how is dV in terms of plx? Let's model it in terms of plx. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of a shell at radius r=1/plx, with thickness dr. So dV = 4π r² dr.

But r = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

Thus, N = n * 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is N/(dplx) = (n 4π)/(plx^4). So it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the confusion arises because the number of stars per unit range of plx is not the same as the number per unit volume. Alternatively, if I think in terms of how many stars are there for a given parallax, perhaps the answer is different.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the distribution of parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the number of stars at a given parallax plx would relate to the volume element at that distance.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. So according to the calculation, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, let me think about real-life data. Do more stars appear at smaller or larger parallaxes? Well, larger parallax means closer stars. So there should be more stars in the lower parallax ranges because the volume per unit distance increases as you go further away.

Wait, no. Wait, for a given range of distance, the volume per unit distance grows with d². So at larger distances (smaller plx), each small increment in distance (d) corresponds to a larger volume. So the number of stars in a given distance range (d to d+dd) is proportional to d².

But how does that translate into parallax? Parallax is 1/d. So for a change in plx from plx to plx + dplx, what is the corresponding d and dd?

Wait, let's say plx is small (big d). So a small change in plx (dplx) corresponds to a change in d of dd = (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit dplx is 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've seen some derivations where the number of stars per magnitude increases with distance. But parallax is related to distance, so that might be a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the number of stars in a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx.

The number of stars N is the number density (n) multiplied by the volume between those two parallaxes. So how do I compute that volume?

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is a spherical shell with radius r = 1/plx and thickness dr. So dr is the change in radius corresponding to a change in plx of dplx.

Since plx = 1/r → dplx = - (1/r²) dr → dr = - r² dplx. The negative just indicates that as plx increases, r decreases. But for the volume, we'll take the absolute value.

So dr = (1/plx^2) dplx. The volume is 4π r^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

N = n * 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.

Wait, but in some sources, I've heard that the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance. But that's about the number density, which I think is constant in this problem. Oh right, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, so number density n is constant.

So I think the correct approach leads to option A, but wait, why is the answer not D, which is 1/plx^3?

Wait, did I make a mistake in the exponents? Let's re-calculate the volume.

r = 1/plx.

dr = (dr/dplx) dplx = (-1/plx^2) dplx → magnitude is 1/plx^2 * dplx.

Volume of shell is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx → 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is N = n * 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

So N per unit dplx is 4π n / plx^4 → ~1/plx^4.

So the answer should be A. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the solid angle comes into play, but I think in this case, it's considered uniform in the sky, so solid angle isn't a factor in the count beyond the spherical shell's surface area.

Wait, but wait another angle: maybe the question is not per unit parallax, but per unit range of parallax. So the number of stars in a given parallax range (like plx to plx + dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4, as we found. But the question says 'number per unit range of parallax (plx)', so that's exactly what we're calculating.

So I think the answer is A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The problem assumes stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant throughout space.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the thickness \( dr \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \) is \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), where the negative sign indicates that \( d \) decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases. Taking the magnitude, \( dr = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \).

The volume of the shell becomes:
\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:
\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases, the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases more steeply than any other power of \( \text{plx} \).

From the given options:
- **A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**: Matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).
- **C) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
- **D) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \).

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
