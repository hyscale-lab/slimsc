Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think. The question gives me the production energy, mass, and width of the meson. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance, and choose between four options.

Wait, what do I remember about decay lengths? Oh right, particles that decay quickly travel a tiny distance before decaying, and ones that are long-lived can travel further. But how do I calculate this?

I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I recall is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?

Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ (since Γ is the total decay width), and Δt is τ. The uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the precise relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Right.

But wait, I should double-check the units. Because ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Let me think. Planck constant h is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, ħ is h/(2π), so approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s divided by 2π. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the commonly used number is ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Because when you use natural units, but in calculations, it's often approximated as 197 MeV·fm or something, but maybe I should stick with the GeV·s unit here.

So the lifetime τ is ħ_bar divided by Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, and ħ_bar is in GeV·s. Let's see. ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So to convert Γ into GeV, since Γ is 320 MeV, that's 0.320 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.320 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.320 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small, but lifetimes of particles are indeed on the order of 1e-10 seconds or smaller. So this seems plausible.

Next, I need the velocity of the meson. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the velocity beta (v/c) using relativistic equations.

The energy E is related to mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Let me write this as E² = p² c² + m² c^4.

But since E and m are both in
