Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. So, I guess that means each region of space has the same number of stars per volume. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the higher its parallax. Oh wait, right! Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I imagine dividing the parallax into small ranges, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Wait, parallax relates to distance. So maybe I should think in terms of distance. Let's say we're looking at a thin shell at a distance d. The volume of that shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the volume of a thin shell would be approximately 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness in distance.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So, number of stars N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density of stars (stars per cubic parsec, say).

But the question is about parallax, which is pl
