Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are about which statement is correct regarding these matrices.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So any observable must be Hermitian. Also, the evolution operator is unitary, which means U must satisfy U† U = I.

Let me check each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. 

Wait, so e^X would be the matrix exponential. The matrix exponential of a matrix X. Hmm, for the norm to change, e^X must not be unitary. Because if U is unitary, then for any vector v, ||U v|| = ||v||. So if e^X isn't unitary, then multiplying by e^X could change the norm.

But wait, what's X? Let me write it down.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So is X Hermitian? Let me check. A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose.

Let's compute the conjugate transpose of X. The elements would be:

Row 1 becomes Column 1 conjugated. So first element (1,1) of X† is (i)* which is -i. (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is -2i.
Row 2 becomes (Row 2 of X) conjugated: i, 0, -2i. Wait, wait. Wait, X's row 2 is 1,0,1. So X† row 2 is 1,0,1?

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The conjugate transpose is the transpose of the conjugate. Let's compute X's conjugate first.

X with each element's complex conjugate:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then transpose this matrix. So X† will be:

Column 1 becomes Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Column 2 becomes Row 2: -1,0,-1
Column 3 becomes Row 3: -2i, 1, i.

So X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i.

Compare this to X, which is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1,0,1
Row3:2i, -1, -i.

Clearly, X is not equal to X†. So X is not Hermitian. But what about e^X? Well, if X is Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary only if X is anti-Hermitian or something? Wait, no. For e^X to be unitary, X must be anti-Hermitian (X† = -X), because then e^X would satisfy U† U = I. Let me see. For example, if X is anti-Hermitian, then X† = -X, so e^{X†} = e^{-X} = (e^X)†. Therefore, e^X would be unitary.

But X is not anti-Hermitian either. So e^X might not be unitary. Wait, but the option is about whether there exists a vector v such that ||e^X v|| ≠ ||v||. That would happen if e^X is not unitary, because if it's not unitary, then there's at least one vector where the norm changes.

So to find out if e^X is unitary, I need to check if e^{X} (e^{X})† = I. But calculating e^X is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find if X is traceless and whether it's anti-Hermitian. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the properties of X. If X is not anti-Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. So if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying by it can change the norm of some vector.

Wait, but whether e^X is unitary depends on X being anti-Hermitian. Let me check if X is anti-Hermitian. So X† should be equal to -X.

Computing X again:

X is:

i    -1    2i
1     0     1
2i   -1    -i

X† as computed before is:

[-i, 1, -2i;
-1, 0, -1;
-2i,1, i]

Now, is X† equal to -X?

Let's compute -X:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i (since X row1 is i, -1, 2i → negated)
Row2: -1, 0, -1
Row3: -2i, 1, i.

Comparing to X†:

X† row1: -i, 1, -2i → same as -X row1.

X† row2: -1, 0, -1 → same as -X row2.

X† row3: -2i, 1, i → same as -X row3.

So yes! X† equals -X. So X is anti-Hermitian.

So, since X is anti-Hermitian, e^X is unitary. Because for anti-Hermitian X, e^X is unitary.

Wait, so then for any vector v, ||e^X v|| = ||v||. So option A says that there exists a vector where the norm changes when multiplied by e^X. But if e^X is unitary, it preserves all norms. So option A is false. So A is incorrect.

Hmm, so first option A is incorrect.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Wait, what's a quantum state? It's a unit vector in a Hilbert space. But in matrix terms, perhaps the operator would be a density matrix, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether the operator is unitary.

Wait, this expression e^X Y e^{-X} is an operator. If it's unitary, then it would be an evolution operator. But wait, Y is a matrix given. Let's see Y:

Row1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2
Row2: 0.1, 0.25, 0.1
Row3: 0.2, 0.1, 0.25

Is Y a density matrix? Because density matrices are positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and trace 1.

Check if Y is Hermitian. Since all elements are real and symmetric? Y is symmetric because Y_ij = Y_ji.

Wait, Y is a 3x3 real symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian. The eigenvalues would be real.

What about the trace? Sum of diagonal elements: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1. So trace is 1.

So Y is a density matrix, which represents a quantum state.

Now, the expression is e^X Y e^{-X}.

Wait, e^X is unitary because X is anti-Hermitian. And e^{-X} is the inverse of e^X, so (e^X) inverse is e^{-X}.

So, (e^X) Y (e^{-X}) is a similarity transformation. Since Y is a density matrix, and the transformation is by a unitary matrix, the resulting matrix would be similar to Y, so it's also a density matrix. So the result is another density matrix, which is a valid quantum state.

So option B says it represents a quantum state. That should be correct. So B is a candidate.

But let me check the other options before jumping to conclusions.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

We already saw that X is anti-Hermitian (X† = -X). So X is not Hermitian, because for Hermitian, X†=X. So X is anti-Hermitian, so it's not an observable. So option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian.

Wait, unless I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck X's conjugate transpose.

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i

Row2: 1, 0, 1

Row3: 2i, -1, -i

Compute X†:

Conjugate each element, then transpose.

Conjugate of X's elements:

Row1: -i, -1, -2i

Row2:1, 0, 1

Row3: -2i, -1, i

Transposing them:

Row1 becomes Column 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2 becomes Column 2: -1, 0, -1

Row3 becomes Column3: -2i, 1, i.

So X† is:

[ -i  1   -2i
  -1  0   -1
  -2i 1    i ]

Which is equal to -X? Let me see:

Original X:

Row1: i, -1, 2i

Row2: 1, 0, 1

Row3: 2i, -1, -i

So -X:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i

Row2: -1, 0, -1

Row3: -2i, 1, i.

Which matches X†. So X is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian. So X is not an observable. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

Evolution operators are unitary matrices. So I need to check if W and X are unitary.

Let me check W:

W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

Is W unitary? For a matrix to be unitary, W† W must equal I.

Compute W†: Since W is real and symmetric (W_ij = W_ji), W† is equal to W^T. W is symmetric, so W^T = W. So W† = W.

Compute W† W = W^2.

W squared is:

[ (0*0 + 0*0 +1*1), ... ] Let's compute each element.

W * W:

First row of W is [0, 0, 1]

Multiply by each column of W.

First column: 0*0 + 0*0 +1*1 = 1.

Second column: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0= 0.

Third column: 0*1 +0*0 +1*0 =0.

So first row of W^2 is [1, 0, 0].

Second row of W: [0,1,0]

Multiply with W's columns:

First column: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0.

Second column:0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.

Third column:0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

Second row: [0,1,0].

Third row of W: [1,0,0]

Multiply with W:

First column:1*0 +0*0 +0*1 =0.

Second column:1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0.

Third column:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

So W^2 is:

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1

Which is the identity matrix. So W is unitary.

So W is unitary. What about X?

We need to check if X is unitary. For X to be unitary, X† X should equal I.

We know X is anti-Hermitian (X† = -X). So X† X = (-X) X = -X².

So X† X = -X². For this to be equal to I, -X² must be I. So X² = -I.

Let me compute X squared.

X is:

Row1: i, -1, 2i

Row2:1, 0, 1

Row3:2i, -1, -i.

Compute X^2.

Let me compute each element.

Element (1,1):

Row 1 of X times column 1 of X:

i*i + (-1)*1 + (2i)*(2i)

Compute each term:

i*i = i² = -1

(-1)*1 = -1

(2i)(2i) =4i² = -4

Total: (-1) + (-1) + (-4) = -6.

Element (1,2):

Row1 * column2:

i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + (2i)*(-1) 

= (-i) + 0 + (-2i) = -3i.

Element (1,3):

Row1 * column3:

i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + (2i)*(-i)

i*2i = 2i² = -2

(-1)*1 = -1

2i*(-i) = -2i²= 2 (since i²=-1)

Sum: (-2) + (-1) + 2 = (-3)+2= -1.

Element (2,1):

Row2 * column1:

1*i + 0*1 + 1*(2i)

= i + 0 + 2i =3i.

Element (2,2):

Row2 * column2:

1*(-1) +0*0 +1*(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

Element (2,3):

Row2 * column3:

1*(2i) +0*1 +1*(-i) = 2i +0 -i = i.

Element (3,1):

Row3 * column1:

2i*i + (-1)*1 + (-i)*2i.

Compute each:

2i*i = 2i² = -2.

(-1)*1 = -1.

(-i)*2i = -2 i² = 2 (since i²=-1).

Sum: (-2) + (-1) +2 = (-3)+2= -1.

Element (3,2):

Row3 * column2:

2i*(-1) + (-1)*0 + (-i)*(-1).

= (-2i) + 0 + i = (-i).

Element (3,3):

Row3 * column3:

2i*(2i) + (-1)*1 + (-i)*(-i)

2i*2i =4i²= -4

(-1)*1 = -1

(-i)*(-i) =i²= -1.

Sum: (-4) + (-1) + (-1) =-6.

So putting it all together, X squared is:

[ -6,  -3i, -1 ]

[ 3i, -2,   i ]

[ -1, -i, -6 ]

Wait, that's X squared. Now what about -I? For X to satisfy X squared = -I, but X squared has elements like -6, which is not -1.

So X squared is definitely not equal to -I. Therefore, X is not unitary.

So option D says that W and X are evolution operators. Well, W is unitary, but X is not. So D is incorrect because X isn't unitary.

So, going back to the options:

Option A is incorrect because e^X is unitary, so no change in norm.

Option B is correct because e^X Y e^{-X} is a unitary transformation of Y, which is a density matrix, so the result is another density matrix, which is a quantum state.

Option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian.

Option D is incorrect because X isn't unitary.

So the correct answer is option B.


The question involves analyzing the properties of matrices in the context of quantum mechanics. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, while the evolution operator is unitary. Here's the analysis of each option:

### Option A:
The statement claims that there exists a vector for which the norm changes when multiplied by \( e^X \). For this to happen, \( e^X \) must not be unitary. However, \( X \) is anti-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), and the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Therefore, \( e^X \) preserves the norm of all vectors, making this option **incorrect**.

### Option B:
The expression \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) involves a similarity transformation of \( Y \) by \( e^X \). Since \( Y \) is a density matrix (Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and trace 1), and \( e^X \) is unitary, the transformation preserves the properties of \( Y \). The result is another density matrix, which represents a valid quantum state. Thus, this option is **correct**.

### Option C:
Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. \( X \) is anti-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)), not Hermitian, so it does not represent an observable. Therefore, this option is **incorrect**.

### Option D:
The evolution operator must be unitary. \( W \) is unitary since \( W^\dagger W = I \). However, \( X \) is not unitary, as \( X^\dagger X \neq I \). Since both \( W \) and \( X \) must be unitary for them to represent the evolution operator, this option is **incorrect**.

### Final Answer:
The correct statement is **Option B**, as \( e^X Y e^{-X} \) represents a valid quantum state.

**Answer: B**
