Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and another reagent B, along with water, to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through a substitution reaction. So, butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide source like NaCN, it's probably undergoing a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but under what conditions does that happen?

Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. But wait, wouldn't that usually happen in a protic solvent, and maybe with an acid catalyst? Or wait, maybe it's more about the conditions. I think when a ketone reacts with HCN or its salts like NaCN in the presence of an acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4, it forms a cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but let me structure that. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, the cyanide would add to the carbonyl, and then a proton would come from somewhere, maybe water or acid. So the product would have an alcohol group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon, making it a cyanohydrin.

So for that reaction, the reagent A would be providing the acidic conditions, perhaps H3O+ which is option A or B. Or wait, wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't require acid, but I'm pretty sure that the addition of HCN to ketones typically happens under acidic conditions because the acid helps to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic and thus the nucleophile (CN-) can attack more readily.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+, which is present in options A and B. So A is either H3O+ or something else in another option
