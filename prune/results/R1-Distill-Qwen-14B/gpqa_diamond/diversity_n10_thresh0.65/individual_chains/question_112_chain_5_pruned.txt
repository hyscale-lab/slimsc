Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that we have an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that spin states are often represented in the z-basis, which are |up> and |down>, corresponding to the eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively for the S_z operator.

Wait, but the question is about another operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given. The operator matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. Oh right, A_ij is ħ/2 when i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix looks like this for a 2x2 system (since the state is a combination of up and down, which are two states):

So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) would be 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) would be ħ/2. So the matrix A would be:

[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0  ]

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The way the question is phrased: Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are ħ/2, and the diagonals are 0. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. And then find the average value of that operator.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I should first find the eigenstates of operator A, because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenstate.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Let me write down matrix A again:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

This looks like a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. It's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with orthogonal eigenvectors.

To find the eigenvalues, I'll
