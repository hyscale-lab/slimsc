Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just simple subtraction, right? Because at high speeds, you can't just do v1 - v2. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the velocity addition formula. Which is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²).

So let me plug in the values. V1 is 0.6c, and V2 is 0.5c. Wait, but which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the first's perspective, what is the speed of the second?

Using the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² )

Calculating numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel =0.14c.

Now, the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². But wait, wait. For each astronaut, their rest mass is given. So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. The second's mass is 3m, speed 0.5c.

So the total energy E is E1 + E2.

E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Gamma for 0.6c: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.
