Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me start by breaking it down step by step.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, and how this ratio changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

Wait, right, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of atoms in different energy levels changes with temperature. The equation is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. But wait, what's the effective temperature exactly? Oh right, it's the temperature that a blackbody would emit the same amount of radiation as the star does. So when spots cover part of the surface, the total emitted flux decreases, and the star appears cooler. But the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the effective temperature is the average based on the entire surface.

But for the purpose of this problem, we don't need to worry about how the spots affect the overall Teff directly. Instead, we're concerned with the photospheric temperature, which I think refers to the temperature of the unspotted regions. Wait, no, the problem states that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the Teff is the average of the entire surface, including the spots. But the photosphere without spots is at a higher temperature, and spots are cooler.

Wait, wait, the question says when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall (average) Teff is 5500 K. So the star's average temperature is lower when spots are present, but the unspotted regions are the same 6000 K as before. No, wait, that can't be. Because if 40% of the surface is covered by cooler spots, the overall Teff would be lower. But the problem says the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, does "photospheric effective temperature" mean the effective temperature of the entire photosphere, which includes the spots? So when spots are present, the average T is lower because parts are cooler. But the actual regions without spots are still at 6000 K, while the spotted regions are cooler.

But the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So in the unspotted regions, the Ti atoms are at 6000 K, and in the spotted regions,
