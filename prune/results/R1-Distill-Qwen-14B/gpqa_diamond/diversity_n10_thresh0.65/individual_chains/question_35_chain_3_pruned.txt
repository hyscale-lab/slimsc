Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember from my studies that angular momentum in quantum mechanics is represented by matrices, and eigenvalues have specific properties.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, I think I've seen this matrix before. Isn't this matrix related to the Pauli matrices? Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall: σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which matches S exactly. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

So Ay = c * σy. And c is h/(4π). So substituting, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

The question asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that for a matrix like this, which is Hermitian (I think σy is Hermitian?), the eigenvalues are real. Wait, are they? Let me think. σy is a Hermitian matrix because its conjugate transpose is equal to itself. Let me check: the conjugate transpose of σy would swap the off-di
