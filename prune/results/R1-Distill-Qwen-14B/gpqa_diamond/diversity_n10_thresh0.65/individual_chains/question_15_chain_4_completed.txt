Okay, so I've got this question about transiting planets and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and their orbital alignment. But wait, how exactly does that work?

The question says both planets have the same mass. They're Earth-like, so I guess their radii are similar. Oh wait, but the host stars have the same radii too. Interesting. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star because a shorter period means it's orbiting more quickly, right?

The main factors affecting the transit probability are the size of the planet and the size of the star, and the size of the orbit. I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on relative to us. But wait, the RV method gives us the minimum mass, and if the inclination is known, we can get the actual mass. But in this case, both are already detected via RV, so maybe the inclination isn't so critical here. Wait, no, the RV method can't determine the exact inclination, only a minimum. Oh, but the question says that both have circular orbits, so that might help in calculations.

The transit probability formula is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. Wait, no, I think the probability (P) is roughly (R_star / a_planet) * (something else). Let me think. Oh right, the probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) times some factor involving the orbital distance, maybe.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is given by P = (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)) ), where e is the eccentricity. Since both orbits are circular, e is zero. So this simplifies to (R_star + R_planet) / a. But wait, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so maybe we can approximate it as R_star / a. But in this case, since both stars have the same radius and the planets are Earth-like, their radii are the same? Or not necessarily? Wait, the question says the host stars have the same radii, but the planets could have different radii if they're Earth-like but maybe not exactly the same size.

Wait, no, the question says both planets are Earth-like, but doesn't specify their radii. However, since the host stars have the same radius, and the planets' masses are the same, perhaps their radii are similar. So for the sake of calculation, perhaps R_planet_1 ≈ R_planet_2. So R_star is the same for both. So the probability would be proportional to (R_star + R_p) / a_p. But since R_p is small compared to R_star, it's roughly R_star / a_p.

Wait, but wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass, but in reality, the mass could be higher if the inclination is high. But since both are detected via RV, which tells us that their minimum masses are already known, so maybe the inclination isn't a factor here? Or perhaps the RV method gives a clue about the inclination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by P = (R_star / a) * ( (1 + R_p / R_star) ) / (1 + (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But maybe that's the probability of the planet transiting. Or perhaps even another approach. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a * (some function of the star's mass and planet's mass). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. For a planet with orbital semi-major axis a, the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) * (something else). Alternatively, I've read that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination. But sin i is 1 for edge-on, so when i is 90 degrees, the probability is highest. But wait, the RV method can only detect planets that are not exactly edge-on, because the Doppler shift is due to the star's motion, which depends on sin i. So for the RV method to detect a planet, sin i must be greater than some value. Therefore, the inclination is known to be above a certain value, which affects the transit probability.

Oh, right! So the transit probability isn't just R_star/(a) times something, but also depends on the prior probability of the inclination. Because the RV method can only detect planets with a certain minimum inclination. So when a planet is detected via RV, that tells us that the inclination is above a certain value, which affects the transit probability.

So the formula for the transit probability, given that the planet is detected via RV, is higher than the general case. For a planet detected via RV, the probability of transit is P = (R_star)/(a) * (1 / (sin i)), where i is the inclination angle. But wait, the RV method tells us sin i > (minimum for detection). So the prior probability for i is known.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it's based on the Doppler shift, which depends on sin i. So if a planet has a true mass M, we observe M sin i. But we can't know i, so the true mass could be higher if sin i is less than 1. But in this question, both planets have the same known masses, so I think that implies their true masses are the same, meaning that the sin i factors are accounted for. So perhaps the RV detection tells us that sin i is such that M sin i is the minimum mass. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the actual masses are the same, so we can set M_p1 = M_p2.

Wait, but the problem says both have the same minimum masses. So the actual masses could be higher. But perhaps for the transit probability, we need to consider the actual mass to find the true inclination, which affects the transit probability.

Wait, the RV method gives M sin i = M_min. So if a planet's true mass is M, the observed M_min is M sin i. So the RV method gives us M_min, but without knowing i, M can be higher. However, in this problem, both planets have the same minimum mass, but their actual masses could be different if their inclinations are different. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps the actual masses are the same, so M_p1 = M_p2 = some value.

But in terms of transit probability, the inclination i affects the transit. The transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_p) / (a * sin i). But since i is unknown, you have to integrate over possible i values. Wait, but the RV method gives us information about i. Because for the RV method to detect a planet with a certain M_min, the inclination must be above a certain angle. So the prior distribution of i for each detected planet is different.

Wait, let me think more carefully. For a planet detected via RV, the measured M_min = M_p sin i. Since M_p is the actual mass, and i is the inclination. So for each planet, we have M_min_p = M_p sin i_p.

But if both planets have the same M_min_p, but different M_p and i_p, then their actual M_p could vary. But in this problem, the planets have the same masses. Wait, the problem says, "Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses."

Ah, so the actual masses are the same. So M_p1 = M_p2 = M. So for each, M_min = M sin i. So for each planet, sin i = M_min / M. But since the M_min is the same for both planets (same minimum masses?), wait no, the problem says both planets have the same minimum masses. Wait, no: it says, "the same masses" — meaning their actual masses are same. Wait, the first part says, "although both planets share the same masses," so M_p1 = M_p2. So in that case, M_min = M_p sin i. So for each, their M_min is different, unless their i is the same.

Wait, no. The question says, "they have the same masses and orbital periods." Wait, wait, let me read again.

The question says: Both of these planets have the same masses. So M_p1 = M_p2. And their minimum masses are known. Wait, but the RV method gives M_p sin i. So if M_p is same, but perhaps their i is different. So M_min = M_p sin i. So for each planet, their M_min would be different unless their i is same. But the problem says that they have the same masses, but their M_min could be same or different?

Wait, the question says, "although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So M_p is same, but periods are different.

Wait, but the RV method gives M_min, which is M_p sin i. So perhaps the M_mins are different because their inclinations are different. But the problem says, "they have the same masses," so actual M_p is same, but M_min could be different. But the question says, "allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods." So Planet_1 has M_min1 and orbital period P1, Planet_2 has M_min2 and P2, which is 3 times P1.

Wait, no, the question says, "the same masses" — so their actual masses are same, but their M_mins could be different if their i is different.

But wait, in the problem, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. The mass of the host star affects the RV measurements because the RV method depends on the star's mass. So the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v_p sin i) * (M_p / (M_star + M_p))^(1/3). So for same M_p and sin i, higher M_star would result in lower K. Wait, but in this problem, the M_min is known, which is M_p sin i. So if the M_star is higher, but M_p sin i is same, then K would be smaller.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me focus back on the transit probability.

The transit probability, considering that the planet has a certain inclination i, is P = (R_star + R_p) / (a) * (1 / (sin i)), but only when sin i is greater than some value. Wait, no. Actually, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is P = (R_star + R_p) / a. But when the planet is detected via RV, which requires that i > i_min, the transit probability is higher.

Wait, no. The RV method has a bias toward higher sin i. So the prior distribution of i for RV-detected planets is higher than for random.

The probability of a transit is given by the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in front of the star. The geometric probability is (R_star + R_p) / a. But for the RV method, because we've already detected the planet, the prior on i is not uniform. So the probability of transit given that the planet is detected via RV is higher than the geometric probability.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability given an RV detection is:

P_transit = ( (R_star + R_p) / a ) * (1 / sin i )

But wait, that can't be. Let me think again. No, perhaps the RV method gives us a prior on i. The prior probability distribution for i is proportional to sin i. Because in a random distribution of inclinations, the fraction with i between i and i+di is proportional to sin i di. So for RV to detect the planet, the minimum inclination is i_min = arcsin( M_min / M_p ). So for each planet, the prior on i is from i_min to 90 degrees.

So the probability of transit, given that the planet is detected via RV, is the integral over all possible i (from i_min to 90) of the probability of transit for that i multiplied by the prior distribution.

Wait, the transit probability is the geometric probability (R_star + R_p)/a multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits.

Wait, more accurately, the probability of transit is (R_star + R_p)/a * (probability that the inclination is such that the RV method detected it and the transit occurs).

So the RV method requires that the inclination is above a certain value i_min. So the probability of transit given RV detection is:

P_transit = (R_star + R_p) / a * [ (1 - sin i_min) / (1 - sin i_min) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula or approach. Alternatively, I remember that for a star with mass M, the transit probability for a planet with period P, radius Rp, and star radius R is:

P_transit = (R_star + R_p) / a * ( sqrt( (1 + (M_p / M_star) ) ) ) / (1 + (M_p / M_star) ) )

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_p) / a * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_star)^(1/3)) )).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the key variables.

The main things we have are:

- Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has period P2 = 3*P1.

- The host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 * M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

- Both stars have the same radius, R.

- Both planets have same mass, M_p.

- Both have circular orbits.

We need to find which planet has a higher transit probability, given that they're already detected via RV.

I think the transit probability depends on the ratio (R_star + R_p) / a, multiplied by some function of M_p and M_star.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_star + R_p) / a * ( (1 + R_p / R_star) / (1 + (M_p / (M_star + M_p))^(1/3) ) ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability for a planet is roughly (R_star + R_p) / a * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) )) )

But I'm not confident about this. Maybe it's better to model a as the semi-major axis, which can be found using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) ) a^3. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate a^3 ≈ [ (G M_star) P^2 ] / (4 π² )

So a = [ (G M_star P^2 )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

But G and π are constants, so for each planet, a is proportional to ( M_star * P^2 )^(1/3 )

Let me write a as proportional to (M_star * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for Planet_1: a1 ∝ ( M1 * P1^2 )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2: a2 ∝ ( M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3 )

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P2 = 3 P1.

So,

a1 ∝ (2 M2) * (P1^2) ^ (1/3 )
a1 ∝ 2^(1/3) * M2^(1/3) * P1^(2/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2) * ( (3 P1)^2 )^(1/3 )
= M2^(1/3) * (3^2 P1^2)^(1/3 )
= 3^(2/3) * M2^(1/3) * P1^(2/3 )

So a1 is proportional to 2^(1/3) * (M2 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

a2 is proportional to 3^(2/3) * (M2 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

So the ratio a2/a1 = [ 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3) ] = (3^2 / 2 )^(1/3 ) = (9/2)^(1/3 ) ≈ (4.5)^(0.333) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

But transit probability is inversely proportional to a, so a smaller a means higher probability.

So P1_transit ∝ 1/a1, P2_transit ∝ 1/a2.

Therefore, the ratio P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) = 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but that's only considering the a. What about the other factors, like R_star, planet radius, and the RV detection.

But in this problem, R_star is same for both, and R_p is same (since they're Earth-like), so (R_star + R_p) is same for both. So the geometric probability (R_star + R_p)/a is higher for the planet with smaller a. So P1 has a higher (R + Rp)/a ratio, leading to higher geometric probability.

But wait, the RV method introduces a bias because it can only detect planets with certain inclinations. So the actual transit probability also depends on the prior distribution of inclinations.

In the case of a planet detected via RV, the transit probability is given by:

P_transit = ( (R_star + R_p) / a ) * ( (1 + (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) ) )^{-1} )

Wait, not sure. Another source I recall says that when considering the transit probability for an RV detected planet, the probability is:

P = (R_star + R_p) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * ( (1 + (M_p/(M_star + M_p))^(1/3) ) / ( M_p/(M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the RV method affects the inclination distribution, so the effective transit probability is higher.

The formula for the probability of transit given RV detection is:

P = (R_star + R_p) / a * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) )) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is given by the geometric probability multiplied by the probability that the inclination is sufficient for RV detection.

Wait, let's think about the inclination. For RV to detect a planet, sin i must be greater than (M_p sin i) / M_p = M_min / M_p.

So the minimum inclination i_min = arcsin( M_min / M_p )

But since M_p is the same for both planets, M_min is same as M_p sin i. So for each planet, M_min = M_p sin i.

Thus, for each planet, sin i = M_min / M_p.

Wait, but the planets have same M_p but different M_min? No, the question says both have same masses, but the M_min is the same? Let me read the question again.

Question states: "Both of these planets have the same masses and orbital periods." Wait, no, the orbital periods are different. Oh, no, the question says: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So P2 = 3 P1.

Wait, but both planets have same masses. So M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.

But M_min = M_p sin i. So if the RV method gave us M_min for each, then for each, sin i = M_min / M_p.

But the question says "they have the same minimum masses." Wait, let me check: "they have the same minimum masses and orbital periods." No, wait, no: the wording is "Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p, but their periods are different.

Ah, so the M_mins are same? Because M_min = M_p sin i. So if M_p is same, then sin i must be same for both planets. Therefore, i is same for both planets. So sin i = M_min / M_p, same for both.

Wait, but the M_min is the same for both planets? Because the question says, "they have the same masses and orbital periods" — no, wait, no. The orbital periods are different. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question says: "Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2."

So M_p1 = M_p2 = same value.

But their orbital periods are different: P2 = 3 P1.

So for each planet, M_min = M_p sin i.

So if M_min is same for both, then sin i is same, so i is same.

But wait, the question says, "they have the same masses and orbital periods." No, no— the question says, "although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So their masses are same, but periods are different.

So M_min for each planet is M_p sin i. So for each, M_min = M_p sin i.

But since RV has detected both, their M_mins are known, but the question doesn't state if their M_mins are same or different. Hmm.

But the question says, "the researchers have chosen to observe:"

So the options are about which planet has higher transit probability. The options suggest that P2 has higher probability (options A and B) or P1 has higher (C and D).

So from Kepler's law, let's find a in terms of M_star and P.

As earlier, a ∝ (M_star * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for Planet_1: a1 ∝ (2 M2) * P1^2 )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2: a2 ∝ (M2) * (3 P1)^2 )^(1/3 ) = (M2 * 9 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2 M2 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

a2 = (9 M2 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

The ratio a2 / a1 = [ (9 M2 P1^2 ) / (2 M2 P1^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (9/2 )^(1/3 ) = (4.5)^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

The geometric transit probability is (R + Rp)/a. Since R and Rp are same for both, the ratio of probabilities is inversely proportional to a.

So P1_geo / P2_geo = ( (R + Rp)/a1 ) / ( (R + Rp)/a2 ) ) = a2 / a1 = 1.65.

So P1_geo is 1.65 times higher than P2_geo.

But wait, does the RV detection affect this? Because when you detect a planet via RV, the inclination has to be above a certain value, which affects the actual transit probability.

The RV method tells us that sin i = M_min / M_p. Since M_min is the same for both planets (same M_p and same M_min?), or maybe not.

Wait, the RV method gives M_min = M_p sin i. So for each planet, M_min is a function of their sin i.

But in the question, both have same M_p, but different M_min? Or same M_min?

Wait, the question says, "they have the same masses and orbital periods." No, the periods are different. So M_p same, but M_min could be different.

Wait, the question says, "they have the same masses and orbital periods." Oh no, no, the actual wording:

"Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2."

Ah, so M_p same, periods different.

But how does this affect M_min? M_min = M_p sin i.

So for each planet, M_min is known, but it's possible that their sin i is different. But unless their M_mins are the same, their sin i would be different.

Wait, the question does not state whether their M_mins are same or different. It just says that both have same masses.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the transit probability without considering RV.

The transit probability is (R + Rp)/a. Since R and Rp are same, the planet with smaller a has higher transit probability.

As calculated, a1 is smaller than a2 (since a2 ≈ 1.65 a1). So P1_geo is higher.

But when considering RV detection, the transit probability increases by a factor of 1/(sin i), because RV tells us that sin i is above a certain value.

Wait, no. The RV method tells us that sin i is greater than or equal to M_min / M_p.

Wait, but in reality, since M_p is same for both, sin i = M_min / M_p.

So for each planet, M_min_p = M_p sin i_p.

Therefore, sin i_p = M_min_p / M_p.

But the question does not specify that M_min_p is same for both.

So if M_min_p is same, then sin i_p is same, so i_p is same.

But if M_min_p is different, then sin i_p is different.

But the question doesn't specify whether their M_mins are same or not. It only says that their masses are same.

Perhaps, since the RV method can detect a planet only if M_min_p >= some value, but in this problem, both have been detected, so M_min_p must be >= something for each.

But without knowing if M_min_p is same, perhaps we can't say.

But since both have same M_p, and same M_min_p (if M_min_p is same), then their sin i is same, so i is same.

Wait, but the problem says that both have been detected via RV, so their M_min_p is known, but it's possible that their M_min_p are different.

But perhaps the RV method's M_min_p doesn't affect the transit probability in this scenario because the question is about the probability, given that we've already detected them via RV.

Wait, perhaps the RV detection gives us a prior on i, which increases the transit probability.

The transit probability given RV detection is P_transit = (R + Rp) / a * (1 / sin i ), but only if i > i_min.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

P_transit = (R + Rp) / (a) * (1 / sin i ) )

But wait, the RV method gives us M_min = M_p sin i, so sin i = M_min / M_p. So substituting, we have:

P_transit = (R + Rp) / a * ( M_p / M_min )

So if M_min is same for both planets, then:

P_transit ∝ (1/a ) * ( M_p / M_min ) = (1/a )

Since M_p and M_min are same, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a.

So if a is smaller (as in Planet_1), then P_transit is higher.

But if M_min is different, then ( M_p / M_min ) would vary.

Wait, but since both have same M_p and same M_min, their transit probabilities would be inversely proportional to a.

So in that case, since a2 is 1.65 a1, P1_transit is 1.65 times higher than P2_transit.

So the researchers would prefer Planet_1, as it has higher transit probability.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times higher.

Wait, earlier calculation said a2 is about 1.65 times a1, so transit probability is 1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

So option C is correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information:

1. **Key Parameters**:
   - Both planets have the same mass, \( M_p \).
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 \), while Planet_2 has \( P_2 = 3P_1 \).
   - The host star of Planet_1 has mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.
   - Both stars have the same radius, \( R \).

2. **Transit Probability**:
   The geometric transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R + R_p}{a} \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( a \) is the orbital semi-major axis. Since \( R \) and \( R_p \) are the same for both planets, the probability depends on \( a \).

3. **Orbital Semi-Major Axis**:
   Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \). Thus, \( a \propto (M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2)^{1/3} \).

   - For Planet_1:  
     \( a_1 \propto (2M_2 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3} \).

   - For Planet_2:  
     \( a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot (3P_1)^2)^{1/3} = (M_2 \cdot 9P_1^2)^{1/3} \).

   The ratio of \( a_2 \) to \( a_1 \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{(9M_2P_1^2)^{1/3}}{(2M_2P_1^2)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65.
   \]

   Thus, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \).

4. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65.
   \]

   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

5. **Conclusion**:
   The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability.

**Answer: C**
