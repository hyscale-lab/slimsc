Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible choices for A and B.

Hmm. I remember that NaCN is often used in nucleophilic substitution reactions. But butan-2-one is a ketone. So maybe it's some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN and another reagent are added, the product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution because they don't have a good leaving group. Unless there's some kind of enol formation or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's an addition-elimination reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with CN- in a basic condition to form a diol with a nitrile group.

But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product has a nitrile group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) both on the same carbon as the ketone. So yeah, that's a cyanohydrin formation. So the reaction is (CH3)2CO + CN- → (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

So how is this done? Cyanohydrin formation usually involves a strong base, like NaOH, to deprotonate the ketone, making it a better electrophile. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's using a weak acid as a catalyst?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So in the presence of a base, the ketone's alpha proton is deprotonated, making the enolate. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin after protonation.

Alternatively, some sources say that the formation of cyanohydrin can be done under acidic conditions. Let me think. Acid catalyzes the addition of nucleophiles to carbonyls. Wait, but for cyanohydrin, the CN- is a weak nucleophile. So maybe under acidic conditions, the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, then CN- attacks. But wait, CN- is a weak base, so in an acid solution, it might be generated from NaCN in situ.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN-. So if the reaction is done in a protic solvent, maybe with an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A). So for part A, the reagent is H3O+.

Wait, but some sources say that cyanohydrin formation is done by treating the ketone with a solution of NaCN in a weak acid, like H2SO4 or H3O+ (from H2SO4 or HCl). So the acid helps the reaction by protonating the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, and CN- acts as a nucleophile. So in that case, reagent A would be H3O+, which is an acid. So looking at the options, A is H3O+ in option A and B.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the structures, the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical reagents for this are either strong acid (like H2SO4, H2O, heat) or strong base (like NaOH, H2O, heat), but the conditions matter.

Wait, another possibility is using a strong acid followed by oxidation. No, more likely hydrolysis.

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, H2SO4 and H2O with heat. Or under basic conditions, like with KMnO4 under acidic conditions, but that might be for oxidation.

Wait, I think that under acidic conditions, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you get a sodium carboxylate, which can be acidified to the carboxylic acid.

But in this reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile (the structure is that the nitrile and hydroxyl are on the same carbon), and it's being converted into 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is turning into a carboxylic acid.

So what reagent would cause that? Well, if it's in water, probably a strong acid or base is used.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction is likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps it's using an oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the reagent is B, and H2O is also present. Let me think about possible reagents.

Another option is that reagent B is HCl. Because in acidic conditions, H+ would protonate the nitrile, perhaps making it more reactive for hydrolysis.

Wait, wait. Another possibility is that it's using a strong acid, like HCl, as the reagent. For example, in the presence of HCl as a catalyst, the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the other option is HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid) as reagent B.

Looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option C has B as HCl as well. Hmm.

Wait, I think that the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions typically requires a strong acid like H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, sometimes HCl is used in a process called hydrolysis, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material has a nitrile and a hydroxyl on the same carbon. So maybe it's a secondary alcohol next to a nitrile. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you get a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

In this case, the reaction conditions might be H2O and an acid. So perhaps the reagent B is an acid, such as HCl or H3O+?

Wait, but in the first reaction, we used H3O+ as reagent A. So in the second reaction, if B is HCl, that's an acid.

Alternatively, sometimes for nitrile hydrolysis, you can use a strong base like NaOH, but that would produce a carboxylate, which then needs to be acidified to get the acid.

But in the second reaction, since it's going directly to the acid, perhaps it's done under acidic conditions.

So if the reagent B is HCl, then the reaction would be in an aqueous acidic environment. That would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile into a carboxylic acid.

So putting that together, for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B for A). For the second, reagent B is HCl (so options A or C for B).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → this would fit.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → I don't know about NaHSO3 in the first reaction.

Wait, what's the role of reagent A in the first reaction? It's the first step. So the first reaction is between butanone, NaCN, and A.

Wait, if the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which usually requires an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+ in options A and B.

So the first reaction uses H3O+.

So the second reaction uses B, which is either HCl (option A and C) or something else.

If the second reaction uses HCl (as B), then the correct option would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can require more than just HCl. Like, maybe concentrated HCl with heat.

But in the problem statement, the second reaction is using H2O and reagent B. So the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So with B being in the presence of H2O.

So the reagent B is acting as a catalyst perhaps, like an acid.

Wait, HCl is an acid, so in H2O, it would make an acidic solution. So HCl as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, another acid like CH3COOH (which is option B and D for B).

Wait, but which acid is more suitable for this hydrolysis?

I think that for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, you can use either strong acid or strong base. So, for example, in acidic conditions, H2SO4 and water under reflux, or in basic conditions with KMnO4 and heating.

But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the reaction is done under acidic conditions because the base would give a carboxylate.

So reagent B is an acid. Looking at the options, reagent B can be HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (option B and D).

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, which would be suitable for hydrolysis. Acetic acid is a weak acid. I'm not sure which would work better here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is done in the presence of H2O and an oxidizing agent. Wait, but the options don't mention any oxidizing agents. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction's product is a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). The second reaction is converting the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. So that's a hydrolysis reaction.

In the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the typical reagents are either H2O with H2SO4 (acidic) or water with KMnO4 under acidic conditions (like H2SO4). Or in basic conditions, using KMnO4 and NaOH, which gives the carboxylate, which is then acidified.

Wait, but in this case, the product is the acid, so it's more likely done under acidic or neutral conditions. Maybe using HCl as the acid.

But wait, another point: the first reaction is done with NaCN and A=H3O+ (acid), which is correct for cyanohydrin formation. Then, the second reaction uses H2O and reagent B. So for the second reaction, if B is HCl, then the reaction would be acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, maybe that's enough. But for nitrile hydrolysis, I think a strong acid is needed. For example, H2SO4 in the presence of water.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid. So option A's B is HCl, which matches.

So putting it all together, reagent A is H3O+ (from options A or B) and reagent B is HCl (from A or C). So the only option with A=H3O+ and B=HCl is option A.

So the answer should be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The problem involves identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with CN⁻ to form a diol with a nitrile group. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acidic catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this reaction.

### Reaction 2:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction is likely carried out under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this reaction.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles compared to HCl.
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for cyanohydrin formation, as it is not an acidic catalyst for this reaction.
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is less effective for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as these reagents are appropriate for both reactions.

Answer: A
