Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what I have to work with. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (or hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, which usually breaks alkenes into diols or something else. Wait, no, more specifically, I think it's used for the cleavage of alkenes to form carbonyl groups. Oh right, when an alkene reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it leads to the formation of a diiodide, but wait, noâ€”I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe the compound has a carbonyl group, and the reaction is something else. But wait, the reaction conditions here are with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, wait, another thought: maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement for carbonyl groups? Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

But first, I should figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

The IR data shows strong peaks. The peaks in the 3400-2500 cm-1 region usually correspond to O-H or N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which likely indicates a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes usually are around 9-10 ppm and might not be as broad. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. More likely, it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, in the IR, there's a 1720 cm-1 peak. That fits with a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Hmm, but the IR also shows a broad peak around 3400-2500, which is consistent with O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.

Then, looking at the other signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): That's a classic para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. So, a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents.

So, putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. Let's imagine substituents at the 1 and 4 positions.

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d
