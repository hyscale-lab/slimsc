Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question involves a reaction scheme starting with compound A and going through several reactions to form compound E. I need to identify compound E from the given options. There are also some hints provided, which should help me.

Let me break down the reactions one by one.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Hmm, I should probably figure out what each of these steps implies about the structures of the compounds.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups, typically forming cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone or aldehyde, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Wait, but sometimes when you add HCN to a carbonyl, it can form a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent to each other. So for example, R2C=O + HCN → R2C(OH)CN.

Wait, but wait. HCN can also undergo other reactions. Oh, right, in the presence of acid, HCN can add to carbonyls in a nucleophilic addition. So the product B would have a nitrile group attached where the carbonyl was.

So if A is a ketone, say RCO, then B would be RC(OH)CN. Wait, but that's a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another possibility is that if A is a cyclic ketone, then adding HCN would form a cyclic structure with OH and CN groups.

But maybe I should think about the hints given. The hints are a) and b).

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting ylides with carbonyl compounds. So the ylide (like a phosphorane) attacks the carbonyl, forming an oxaphosphorane intermediate which then eliminates to form the alkene.

Wait, so if A reacts with a Wittig reagent to form that compound, which is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me draw that structure.

The compound is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would
