Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, it's about electric fields and conductors. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges and electric fields. So, the setup here is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The cavity is also spherical, and the centers are separated by a distance s. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than the conductor's radius R.

So, the conductor is uncharged, which means it has no net charge. But then a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Now, I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, right? So the conductor's radius is R, and L is bigger than R, which makes sense.

I remember that when you have a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity influence the charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, when we add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

But wait, no. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you place +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q induced. That leaves the outer surface with +q, because the total conductor's charge is zero (since it was uncharged). Oh wait, no. Wait, no, the conductor is initially uncharged, but when you add +q inside, the conductor's total charge is still zero? Or does it change?

No, the conductor was uncharged, but the +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor's total charge remains zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface remains zero? No, that can't be right because the conductor's net charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. Inner is -q, so outer is +q.

Wait, wait, no. Because the conductor was uncharged, and the +q is inside the cavity. The conductor's net charge is zero, so the charges on the inner
