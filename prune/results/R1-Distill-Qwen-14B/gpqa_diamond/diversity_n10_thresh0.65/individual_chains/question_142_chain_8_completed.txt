Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question presents a density matrix ρ, which is given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different r coordinates.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix for a qubit can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space. The Bloch sphere comes into play here, right? The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit state where each point on the sphere corresponds to a possible quantum state.

Wait, the general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ represents the Pauli matrices. The vector r = (x, y, z) is a point in 3D space, and the dot product r·σ gives a matrix combination of the Pauli matrices. 

So, let me break down the given ρ. The expression is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a matrix that's 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding these together gives a diagonal matrix with [1, 0; 0, 1], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ equals I/2, that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. So r·σ =0, which means that the vector r must be zero. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way their combination is zero is if each coefficient is zero. So r must be (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the answer. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check.

The density matrix being I/2 would mean it's a completely mixed state. Because a pure state would have trace ρ² equal to 1, but for a mixed state, it's less. Let me compute the trace of ρ squared. ρ = I/2, so ρ² is (I/2)^2 = I²/4 = I/4. The trace of I/4 is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Since it's less than 1, it's a mixed state, which makes sense because the Bloch vector is at the origin, meaning it's the maximally mixed state.

Yes, that makes sense. So the point in the Bloch sphere would be at (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the general form of a qubit density matrix, 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

\(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in 3D space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing the two expressions, it is clear that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which is option C.

Answer: C
