Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration can be tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They want to know the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two pH values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So the equivalence point would be when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate.

Wait, but since the solution is diluted first, I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution before anything else. Okay, let's start with that.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The dilution equation is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/V2. Plugging in the numbers:

M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 1/4 = 0.025 M. Oh, wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, when you mix two solutions, you have to calculate moles. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the moles before and after.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = moles/volume (L). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles stay the same, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, same as before.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So we're adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the diluted acetic acid.

Wait, but let's think about what happens at each step.

First, let's calculate the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. Let's find out how much.

The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid remaining will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025
