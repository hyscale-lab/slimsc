Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through a series of transformations. Then, after ozonolysis, we're looking at the NMR spectrum of the product. Hmm, I remember that ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds, so I should probably track the structure changes through each step.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. I think this is an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo here?) react with a base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons? Or maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons? No, wait, no. In adamantane, the structure is a diamond-like lattice; the positions are not adjacent. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to two others, but 1 and 3 might be opposite each other or something. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, but regardless, heating with KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. So the product after the first step would be an adamantyl derivative with a double bond. The product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, because 4.79 is a bit upfield for a vinyl group, but maybe it's an epoxide or an ether?

Wait, but the IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group. So maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxide's carbonyl (C-O) is around 1200-1250 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is more like a ketone or an ester. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde? No, aldehydes are around 2820 for the stretch, but their carbonyl is around 1720, so that's possible. But wait, the initial product is from elimination. So if we had 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminate, that would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. But wait, what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Let me think. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to four others in a diamond lattice. The 1 and 3 positions could be on adjacent faces, but perhaps the elimination would form a bridge or a ring structure with a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The NMR of product 1 shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Another peak is 2.41-2.23 (10H), which is probably the adamantane structure's protons, which are typically in the 1.5-2.5 ppm range. And 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, maybe part of an ether or ketone.

But wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. How? Oh wait, perhaps a more complex structure.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe it forms an epoxide via an elimination-addition mechanism. Wait, no, KOH is more of a base for elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, and then some other reaction. Alternatively, could it be a vicarious nucleophilic substitution? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. Wait, but KOH would be a base, not a nucleophile in elimination. So elimination is more likely, but if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, maybe it forms a bridgehead double bond. For example, the molecule would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is a doublet or a quartet or something. Since it's 2H, maybe it's a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an epoxide. Wait, but then why the IR peak at 1720 cm-1? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide. Oh wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons, perhaps leading to epoxide formation upon treatment with a base. No, wait, that's not how epoxide forms. Epoxides are typically formed from diols under acid catalysis, or from alkenes via oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps under basic conditions, we might form a ketone via some elimination? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about product 1's structure. The IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How can that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of keto-enol tautomerism? Or perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl formation. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond and some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Wait, but that might not fit with the NMR.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group (from the IR), so maybe product 2 is an acylated compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but product 1's structure must be correct before I can proceed. Let's get back to the first step.

1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH (a strong base) would lead to elimination. Since it's vicinal dihalide, elimination would form a double bond. So product 1 would be adamantane with a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. So structure would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that.

Wait, but then the NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm, which is a CH2 group. Hmm, a double bond wouldn't have a CH2, unless perhaps it's an endo-trig structure or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a transannular elimination.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. If that's the case, the two OH groups would form, but maybe under basic conditions, it would deprotonate. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at ~4.79 ppm for 2H. If it's an epoxide, the adjacent CH2 groups would be deshielded and show up around 4 ppm. Oh wait, but the IR doesn't show the epoxide's C-O-C stretching. Only the 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a ketone. How? If elimination leads to formation of a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond and possibly a carbonyl via some conjugation. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated diene with a carbonyl group. Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide. Then, perhaps in the next step, when heated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some reaction. Maybe the epoxide ring opens under acid catalysis? But Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so it could protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, perhaps a ring-opening occurs. But what would the product be?

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is converted into something else, like a diol, but that doesn't seem to fit with the next steps.

Wait, but the second step's product (product 2) undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, let's think again. So product 1 is formed from heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If it's an elimination, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene (a double bond between C1 and C3). Then, product 1 is heated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, so maybe product 1 is an aromatic compound. But adamantane is already a polycyclic structure, perhaps with some substituents.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. So in product 1, the two Brs are replaced by an oxygen bridge, forming an epoxide. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, maybe it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or alkylation.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 (2H) could be an epoxide's CH2 groups. Then, the 1.94 (2H) might be a different CH2, perhaps from the adamantane structure.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a ketone. Let's say that, for some reason, the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Then, the IR would show the ketone's carbonyl. Then, product 1 would be a ketone.

In the second step, heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide would probably lead to some acylation or alkylation. But ketones aren't very reactive towards Friedel-Crafts. Unless product 1 is an aromatic ketone, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If KOH caused a substitution reaction, replacing Br with OH groups. But KOH is more of a base for elimination. However, if the reaction is under high temperature and KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a substitution. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, which contradicts the given data. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should try another approach. Let's look at the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a triplet. Let's think about possible groups. Maybe it's an epoxide's CH2 group. Epoxides typically have protons around 3-4 ppm, but sometimes they can be upfield or downfield depending on the structure. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether.

The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably part of the adamantane structure, which usually has protons in that region. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps in a different environment.

The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, so product 1 must have a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or similar. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone formed from the starting material. How?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, and then that double bond is subjected to some other reaction. Wait, but KOH is just a base in the first step. Alternatively, maybe the product is a transannular ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone via elimination. For example, if a hydrogen is abstracted from a carbon adjacent to Br, leading to a double bond and formation of a carbonyl via some rearrangement. But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, which would have an oxygen adjacent to a double bond. But the IR doesn't show the C=O stretch in that case. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol. No, because the IR would show an O-H stretch around 3300, which isn't mentioned. So that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Let's say that, but how would that form from elimination?

Wait, perhaps the first step produces a bridged bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene with a carbonyl group. But I'm not getting anywhere quickly, so maybe I should proceed to the second step.

Assuming product 1 is an epoxide, product 2 would be formed when Al isopropoxide is added. Al isopropoxide is a good Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So perhaps product 1 is an epoxide with some substituents that can undergo acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl as per IR. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide with a ketone group elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second step forms a more complex structure, but without knowing product 1, it's hard to say.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it.

But let me think: product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. So perhaps product 2 is a diene. Because when you ozonolyse a diene, you might get multiple carbonyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a substituted alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or a compound with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the NMR of product 3 after ozonolysis.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So after ozonolysis, product 3 is formed by breaking a double bond into carbonyl groups. The deshielded hydrogen would be near an electronegative group or in a strained environment.

Ozonolysis of a diene usually gives carbonyl compounds. So perhaps the starting material for ozonolysis (product 2) is a diene. The ozonolysis would break each double bond into two carbonyls, so product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis can have different outcomes depending on the structure. For example, if the diene is conjugated, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls. Alternatively, if it's a cyclic diene, like in a ring, the product would be a diketone.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis step, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide. That's a standard procedure for ozonolysis, which typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 is the ozonolysis product of product 2.

So, the structure of product 3 would depend on the structure of product 2. To find the coupling pattern in product 3, I need to figure out how the protons are arranged around the carbonyl groups.

So, let's assume product 2 has a double bond. When ozonolysis occurs, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl. So, if the double bond was between carbons A and B, then carbons A and B each form carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes, depending on substitution).

Now, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. Because deshielding occurs near electronegative atoms, which is why such protons appear downfield (higher ppm).

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton would likely be next to a carbonyl, perhaps as a CH2 or CH group.

Now, considering the coupling pattern: if a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2, you might see a triplet of triplets or some more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2, the splitting could be a triplet, doublet of triplets, etc.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with a CH2-CHO group. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Maybe the product has a structure like O=C-R, where R has some protons.

Wait, let's think of a specific case. Suppose product 2 is a compound with a double bond between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, forming two ketones. So, for example, if product 2 is CH2-CH2 (but that's just ethylene, which on ozonolysis gives two formaldehyde molecules). But that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is part of a larger structure, like a substituted alkene. For example, product 2 could be something like R-CH2-CH2-R'. Upon ozonolysis, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl. So, if the double bond was between two CH2 groups, each becomes a ketone (if R and R' are more substituted) or aldehydes (if less substituted).

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alkene where each end has a CH2 group. So ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. Then, product 3 would have two aldehyde protons.

But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and they are deshielded. In the NMR, the most deshielded proton would be the aldehyde proton. But the question says to exclude protons that exchange with deuterated solvent, so aldehyde protons are generally not exchanged, so they should be considered.

But wait, in the given scenario, the product after ozonolysis is product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

If product 3 has an aldehyde group, the aldehyde proton would be the most deshielded. The coupling for an aldehyde proton is usually a triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group which is split into a triplet.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. An aldehyde has the structure R-CHO. The aldehyde proton is adjacent to the carbonyl group. The only neighboring protons would be any on the adjacent carbon. If that adjacent carbon is a CH2, then the aldehyde proton would couple with the two protons on the CH2. Wait, but in reality, the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because the neighboring carbon (the one attached to the aldehyde) is a CH2, which has two protons. But wait, each of those protons is equivalent, so the aldehyde proton would see two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, no, wait. The aldehyde proton is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. The adjacent carbon (the one attached to the aldehyde) is a CH2, which has two protons. So each aldehyde proton would couple with those two protons. Each coupling would be a doublet, but since there are two equivalent protons, the splitting would be a triplet.

So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet. But wait, sometimes the coupling can be more complex if there are more neighboring protons.

Wait, but in the case of product 3, if the structure is something like O=C-R, where R has a CH2 group, then the aldehyde proton (if present) would be split by the neighboring CH2's protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group but not an aldehyde. For example, a ketone adjacent to a CH2 group.

Let me think of another structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O. No, that's not right. Maybe more accurately, after ozonolysis of a substituted diene, you'd get two carbonyl groups connected by some chain.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups, leading to product 3.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

In the first step, product 1's IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 might be a ketone. Then, in the second step, product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe this induces some kind of aldol condensation or some elimination, forming a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond, which is then cleaved in ozonolysis.

So, product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis of this alkene would form two carbonyl groups. Let's say product 3 is a diketone or something with two carbonyls.

In product 3, the most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl. Let's imagine that the structure has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Wait, no, that's a symmetric structure, but perhaps each end is a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the middle CH2 groups would have protons that are adjacent to CH2 groups on both ends. So each of those middle CH2's protons would be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl. Those would be the end CH2 groups.

So, for each CH2 group next to the carbonyl, each proton would be adjacent to the carbonyl (which deshields them) and coupled with the neighboring CH2 group.

Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 group is between the carbonyl and the next CH2. So the end CH2 groups (attached to the carbonyls) would each have two protons. Each of these protons would be adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two protons.

So, for each end CH2, each proton would see two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with two H's on the next CH2, leading to a triplet for each.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of a specific example: let's say we have O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each end CH2 is attached to the carbonyl. Each of their protons would be adjacent to the middle CH2 group, which has two protons. So each end proton would be split by the two protons on the middle CH2.

But wait, the middle CH2 has two protons, which are equivalent. So each end proton (on the end CH2) would couple with those two, leading to a triplet. Because each end proton is next to a CH2 with two H's, it would split into a triplet.

But wait, is there more coupling? Because the middle CH2 is between two CH2 groups. So each middle CH2 proton is next to two end CH2 protons on either side. So for the middle CH2, each H would be next to two on the left and two on the right, leading to a more complex splitting.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which are the end CH2's protons. So each of these would be a triplet, because they're next to a CH2 with two H's.

So in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet. But wait, another possibility: perhaps the end CH2 is next to another CH2 which is next to another CH2. So each H on the end CH2 would see two H's from the middle CH2. So each H would have two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each end CH2 is adjacent to a CH2 which is adjacent to another CH2, then the splitting could be more. For example, the end H would couple with two H's on the first adjacent CH2, and those two H's each couple with another CH2, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but in the case of O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, each end CH2 is connected to a middle CH2, which is connected to another middle CH2. So each end CH2's H would see the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each end H would be a triplet. But the middle CH2's H's would be next to two H's on either side, leading to a quartet perhaps.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which are the end CH2's protons. So their coupling would be a triplet.

So the answer would be option A: triplet.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with each carbonyl connected to a CH2 group. So each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl. Each CH2 would have two H's, and those H's would be adjacent to another CH2 group.

So for each H on the end CH2, they are next to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Thus, the coupling pattern would be triplet, so option A is correct.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) analyzed via NMR. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (Formation of Product 1):**  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, forming a double bond. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the elimination leads to a structure with a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The NMR data supports this: the peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen, and the 1.94 ppm (2H) corresponds to another CH₂ group.

2. **Second Reaction (Formation of Product 2):**  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely induces a reaction that forms a double bond in product 2. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred to contain a double bond based on the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Third Reaction (Formation of Product 3):**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would experience coupling with neighboring protons. For example, if the structure of product 3 is a diketone with CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyls, the protons on these CH₂ groups would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3:**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This hydrogen is coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

**Analysis of Options:**  
- **A) Triplet:** This matches the expected coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen, as it is adjacent to a CH₂ group with two protons.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets:** This would require coupling with two distinct sets of protons, which is not supported by the structure.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets:** This would require a more complex splitting pattern, which is not consistent with the expected structure.  
- **D) Pentet:** This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not the case here.

**Conclusion:**  
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet. 

ANSWER: A
