Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I remember that cyclopentenols can undergo some specific reactions when they react with bromine, which is a dihalogen. Let me think about what I know.

First, the structure of the compound: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So cyclopentane means a five-membered ring. The enol part means there's an alcohol group adjacent to a double bond. In this case, it's cyclopent-1-enol, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. And at the 4 position, there are two methyl groups attached. So the structure would have the double bond at 1-2, the hydroxyl group on carbon 1 (since enol is a conjugated diene with an -OH group), and two methyl groups on carbon 4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, enol structure. Enol is an alcohol with a double bond adjacent. So cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group on C1. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, and an -OH on C1. Then, there are two methyl groups on C4, which is adjacent to C5, I think. So the ring positioning is such that C4 is next to C3 and C5.

Now, when this enol reacts with bromine (Br2), what typically happens? I think that dienols can undergo addition reactions with bromine. Alternatively, since it's a conjugated diene, maybe it's more about dihydroxylation or something else. But wait, cyclopent-1-enol is an allylic alcohol, right? Because the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the OH is on C1, making C2 the adjacent one.

Wait, another thought: when alkenes react with bromine, they typically add across the double bond in a dibromination. But enols are more reactive because of the conjugation between the double bond and the hydroxyl group. So maybe the reaction is a bromohydrin formation? Wait, but bromine is in excess, maybe.

Wait, but wait. The enol's structure is such that the double bond is conjugated with the hydroxyl group. So when bromine adds, perhaps it adds to the double bond, but the enol might influence where the addition occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol can undergo an acid-catalyzed opening or some other reaction. Wait, but in the presence of bromine, maybe it's about allylic bromination. Oh wait, allylic bromination usually happens via a radical mechanism, but perhaps with enols, under certain conditions, it can occur via a different pathway.

Wait, another angle: the enol could tautomerize to form a ketone. Because enols and ketones (or aldehydes) can interconvert via keto-enol tautomerism. So 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol might actually be the enol form of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So when the enol is treated with bromine, perhaps the ketone form is more reactive or something happens there.

Wait, but the reaction is between the enol and bromine. Let me think about what the product would be. If the enol is reacting, then the addition of bromine across the double bond would likely occur. But wait, in enol systems, sometimes the addition can lead to the formation of a dibromide, but perhaps in a specific position.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that's more with other oxidizing agents. Wait, no, bromine can add across double bonds in a dibromide addition.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol. So if the double bond is between C1 and C2, when bromine adds, the Brs would add across that double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide. But wait, the structure would then have Br on C1 and C2. But in the options, I see some dibromides but others are mono-brominated. Let me check the options.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So that's a diol with two bromos on C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl on C1. Wait, but in the starting material, the OH is on C1, so if the addition is across the double bond, the OH would be replaced by Br, maybe?

Wait, no, perhaps when bromine adds to the double bond, the OH group is in the same area. Let me think about the structure. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, so the enol has the double bond between C1-C2 and the OH on C1.

When bromine adds, the double bond (C1-C2) would react, adding Br across. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2. But wait, the starting material already has an OH on C1. So would the OH be replaced by Br, or would the addition occur in such a way that the OH is retained?

Hmm, perhaps the OH is on the same carbon as one of the bromines. Wait, in the enol, the structure is a five-membered ring with the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. So when bromine adds, it adds across the double bond. So the C1 would get a Br, and C2 would get a Br. But wait, the OH is on C1, so perhaps the addition leads to substitution. Wait, maybe it's more like a bromohydrin formation but in reverse.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is deprotonated under reaction conditions, making the enol more reactive. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition. For enols, when they react with an electrophilic reagent like bromine, perhaps the reaction occurs at the less substituted position because of the enol's conjugation.

Wait, but in the case of addition, the bromine would add across the double bond, so the enol's double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding Br across that would give a vicinal dibromide. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, with the OH still on C1. Wait, but that can't be right because the double bond is C1-C2, and adding Br would mean the OH group is on C1 and Br would be added to C1 and C2. That would make the product have Brs on both C1 and C2, but the OH is already on C1. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the addition of Br2 leads to the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate. The ring opens, and the Brs add across the double bond. So in the case of 1,2-dibromocyclopentane derivative. But in this case, the OH is on C1, so would that lead to a diastereomeric outcome?

But looking at the options, options A and D are dibromides. Option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Option D is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So the difference is in the configuration of the Brs.

Wait, but considering the starting material: the enol is cyclopent-1-enol, which is a ring with an OH on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

So when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add Br to C1 and C2. So the product would have two Brs on adjacent carbons, and the OH is still on C1. But wait, can C1 have both an OH and a Br? That would mean the structure is 1,2-dibromo-1-hydroxycyclopentane or something like that. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an addition of Br across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide, but without the OH. But the starting material has the OH; perhaps the addition doesn't replace the OH but adds Brs on the adjacent C.

Wait, perhaps the OH is in a position that affects the addition. During the addition of Br2, the OH could be a good leaving group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation, but no, the reagent is Br2, not an peracid.

Another angle: perhaps the enol tautomerizes to the ketone before reacting. So 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol tautomerizes to 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, the ketone would undergo a reaction with bromine. Wait, but what reaction do ketones undergo with bromine?

Well, ketones are generally not very reactive towards bromine unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine would add to the carbonyl group, but that would be more like a nucleophilic addition, but bromine is more of an electrophilic reagent. Alternatively, maybe the ketone could undergo some kind of halogenation, like a Friedel-Crafts type, but that's for aromatic rings, which this isn't.

Wait, perhaps the ketone form isn't the reactive one, and the enol is. So back to the initial idea: the enol reacts with Br2 by adding across the double bond. So the product would have two Brs on C1 and C2, and the OH remains on C1.

But in that case, the structure would be 1,2-dibromo-1-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylcyclopentane. But looking at the options, option A is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is a diol with Br on C1 and C2, and OH on C1. Wait, but cyclopentanol would have an OH on a cyclopentane ring, not a cyclopentene. So if the double bond is broken, then it's cyclopentane with Brs and an OH.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry. When bromine adds to a double bond, it's a stereospecific addition, leading to the dibromide with the Brs on opposite sides, but the stereochemistry would depend on the starting structure.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclopentene ring, so the double bond is in a ring. When Br2 adds, it forms a dibromide across the double bond, which would open up the ring? No, wait, the ring would remain intact, but the double bond would become a single bond with two Brs added.

Wait, but cyclopentane is a five-membered ring. Adding Brs to C1 and C2 would make a vicinal dibromide. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH still on C1. But if the addition is across the double bond, then the OH might not be on the same carbon anymore.

Wait, no. The starting enol has the double bond between C1 and C2, with the OH on C1. When Br adds across the double bond, C1 and C2 each get a Br. But since C1 already has the OH, that would mean C1 has both Br and OH. Wait, that isn't possible because that would be a lot of substituents on a single carbon. So perhaps the addition isn't directly on the same carbon as the OH.

Wait, perhaps the OH group is in a position that affects the addition. Maybe the OH is part of the conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition, but that's more for conjugated dienes, but this is a cyclopentenol, which is a five-membered ring.

Alternatively, maybe the enol's structure allows for a different mode of addition. For example, bromine can add in a way that the OH is retained, but the Brs are added to adjacent positions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is an epoxide formation, but no, that's done with peracids. So, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but that's more with OsO4, not Br2.

Alternatively, maybe the enol is more reactive towards bromination. Wait, maybe allylic bromination occurs. Allylic bromination happens when there's a double bond, and a bromine radical abstracts a hydrogen from the allylic position, leading to a bromide there.

Wait, but allylic bromination typically uses NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) with light or a peroxide initiator, and it's a radical mechanism. But the question uses Br2, so perhaps it's a different mechanism. Or maybe it's an ionic mechanism.

Wait, but in the presence of Br2, could the enol undergo allylic bromination? Let me think about the structure. The enol has a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH on C1. So the allylic position would be C3 and maybe C5.

Wait, no, in a cyclopentene ring, each carbon is connected to two others. The positions adjacent to the double bond are C5 (on C1) and C3 (on C2). So for C1, the adjacent carbons are C5 and C2. So the allylic positions for C1 would be C5 and C2 is part of the double bond. So, perhaps the bromine adds at the allylic position.

Wait, but in allylic bromination, the hydrogen is abstracted from a carbon adjacent to the double bond. So in this case, the positions would be C3 (for C2) and C5 (for C1).

So if the enol undergoes allylic bromination, Br would add to C3 or C5. Which option matches that?

Looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, but the starting material is the enol form, but if it tautomerizes to the ketone first, then the bromine would add to the ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, if the bromine adds to the double bond, the product would have Br on C1 and C2. But the options don't have that, but options A and D are diols with Brs on 1 and 2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, like a 1,4-addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. Let's break down each option:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So this is a cyclopentanol (OH on the ring) with Br on C1 and C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So the ketone (cyclopentanone) has a Br on C2 and two methyl groups on C4.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. The ketone has a Br on C4, which is already carrying two methyl groups. So that's 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Another diol with Brs on 1 and 2, but same as A but different stereochemistry.

So, considering these options, perhaps the reaction is either adding Br across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide with OH (so options A or D), or adding Br to the ketone form (if it tautomerizes), leading to mono-brominated products (options B or C).

Wait, but the starting material is the enol. If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, then the reaction would be with the ketone. So what happens when cyclopentanone reacts with Br2?

Well, ketones can undergo some halogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the bromine would perform a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group, but I don't think that's typical without a catalyst.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol doesn't tautomerize, and the reaction occurs on the enol form. So adding Br across the double bond.

If that's the case, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH remains on C1. So looking at the options, options A and D are the possibilities. The difference is the configuration (R and S or both R).

Wait, considering the addition of Br2 to a double bond, the addition is trans. So in the starting enol, the double bond is in a certain configuration. For cyclopentene, the substituents are arranged in a certain way.

But wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring has two methyl groups on C4.

When Br2 adds across the double bond, the two Brs would add anti to each other. So the resulting molecule would have Brs on C1 and C2 in a trans configuration.

But in the options, A and D are enantiomers or diastereomers. However, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R). So which configuration is formed?

Wait, perhaps the addition of Br2 would lead to a specific stereochemistry. Let me imagine the structure in 3D. The double bond is in the ring, so the substituents (methyl groups on C4) would influence the approach of Br2.

But I'm not entirely sure about the absolute configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a vicinal dibromide, and the stereochemistry depends on the starting structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction doesn't add Br across the double bond but adds in a conjugated position. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the formation of a bromohydrin. But wait, bromohydrin formation typically involves the addition of Br and OH across a double bond, but that would require water or some other nucleophile. Since the starting material is already an enol, maybe the bromine adds in a way that places Br next to the OH group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a bromohydrin formation, but in this case, the OH is already present, so perhaps it's a substitution. Hmm, I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed process where the enol is protonated, making it more reactive. Then, the addition of Br would occur.

Wait, perhaps the enol is more reactive towards electrophilic addition because of the conjugated lone pairs from the OH. So when Br2 adds, the Brs would add across the double bond, giving a vicinal dibromide, with the OH still attached.

So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Looking at the options, that's either option A or D, depending on the configuration.

Now, about the configuration: when Br2 adds to a double bond, it adds in a trans fashion. So the two Brs would be on opposite sides. But in the case of a cyclopentane ring, the configuration would depend on the starting structure.

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The substituents on C4 are two methyl groups, which are on the same side of the ring? Or are they on opposite sides?

Actually, the configuration of the starting enol isn't specified, so perhaps the product's stereochemistry isn't determined, but the options do have specific configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to an epoxide-like opening but with Br, but that's again not likely.

I think I'm going in circles. Another approach: let me think about the possible reaction of enols with bromine. Maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position. Wait, the alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl, but in this case, the enol has an OH. Maybe the Br adds to an alpha carbon.

Wait, but the enol is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The alpha carbons are C1 (with OH) and C2, C3, and C5 are the other positions.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the OH is deprotonated, making the alpha carbon more susceptible to bromination.

Wait, if the enol is treated with Br2, perhaps the reaction is a free radical substitution. The OH could be a hydrogen donor, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not fully remembering the exact reaction pathway. So perhaps I should recall that when enols react with halogens like bromine, they undergo conjugate (1,4) addition in some cases, but that's more for dienols.

Wait, but in this case, it's a cyclic enol. So maybe the bromine adds in a conjugate fashion. For example, in a five-membered ring, adding Br across C1 and C2 would create a bridge, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enol isn't reacting directly but tautomerizes to the ketone first. If it becomes 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, then what would happen when bromine is added.

In that scenario, the ketone would have a carbonyl group at C1. Then, bromine could add to the carbonyl. But typically, adding bromine to a ketone isn't straightforward. Unless it's under specific conditions, like in the presence of a base or something else.

Wait, but if the ketone is treated with bromine in a nucleophilic addition, perhaps it would add a Br to the carbonyl, forming a bromide. But that's not typically how it works because ketones are usually not very reactive towards electrophilic additions unless they have strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone can undergo a bromination at the alpha position. So in 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5 (since C1 is the carbonyl). So adding Br to C2 would give 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, which is option B.

But wait, why would the alpha position brominate? Typically, alpha bromination requires a good leaving group or some activation, perhaps via enolates.

Wait, in the presence of a strong base, the ketone could form an enolate, which could then react with bromine. But the question doesn't mention any base, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol form allows for electrophilic attack at the alpha position. So the enol has a conjugated system that stabilizes the positive charge when Br adds.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the enol's conjugation makes the alpha position (C2) more susceptible to bromination, leading to substitution.

Wait, but without a base, I'm not sure how the enolate would form. So perhaps another approach is needed.

I'm going to try to piece this together. The options are between adding Br across the double bond (di bromide, options A and D) or adding Br to the alpha position (options B and C).

If the reaction adds Br across the double bond, the product would have two Brs on adjacent carbons (1 and 2) and the OH on C1. That would correspond to options A or D.

Alternatively, if the Br adds to the alpha position (C2 in the ketone form), the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (option B) or 4-bromo (option C). But why would Br add to C2 or C4?

Wait, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone has methyl groups on C4, which are bulky. If Br adds to the alpha position, it would be more likely at the less substituted positions. C2 is adjacent to the carbonyl (C1), so adding Br there might lead to option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the enol has a structure that allows for a bromohydrin formation, but that's adding both Br and OH across the double bond, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the enol is more reactive towards bromine addition, leading to a bromide at C2. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the addition of Br2 to an enol might lead to the formation of a dihydroxy dibromide. Wait, perhaps the OH is involved in the addition.

Wait, the enol has the structure where the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So when Br2 adds, the Brs would be added to C1 and C2. But since C1 already has an OH group, perhaps the OH isn't replaced but coexists with the Br.

But that would lead to a structure where C1 has both OH and Br, which is unusual but possible. So the product would be 1-bromo-1-hydroxy-2-bromocyclopentane or something. But I don't see that as an option.

Wait, perhaps the OH is removed during the reaction. For example, if the OH is deprotonated to form an oxide, which then reacts with Br2. But without knowing the reaction conditions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the less substituted end of the double bond. So adding Br to C2, which is less substituted than C1 (since C1 has the OH and C2 is adjacent to the ring).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Another approach: let's think about the options. Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So that would imply that the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and then a Br is added to C2.

How would that happen? Maybe via enolate formation. If the ketone is treated with a base to form an enolate, which then reacts with Br2. But the question doesn't mention any base, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes some other reaction with Br2. But I'm not aware of ketones reacting directly with bromine to form alpha brominated products without a base.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enol reacts with bromine via an electrophilic attack. The conjugated system of the enol could make the alpha position (C2) more electrophilic, making it a target for Br2.

Alternatively, in the presence of Br2, the enol could undergo a bromination at C2, leading to a bromide there. But without the enol tautomerizing, I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck between two possibilities: either the product is a vicinal dibromide (options A or D) or a mono-brominated ketone (options B or C).

Another angle: the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. If the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, the product would be 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, when Br2 is added, perhaps a bromine adds to the less substituted position, which would be C2, giving option B.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine adds to the more substituted position, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to decide. Let me think about the possible major products.

If the reaction is a simple addition of Br2 across the double bond, the major product would be a vicinal dibromide. But the options don't have that for the ketone form, but for the diol form.

Alternatively, if the enol tautomerizes and then undergoes alpha bromination, the product would be a ketone with Br on C2 or C4.

Wait, but considering the options, I'm leaning towards the vicinal dibromide, which would be options A or D. Since the starting material is an enol, the addition would occur across the double bond.

But looking at the options, options A and D are diols with Br on C1 and C2. So perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a diol with Brs.

Wait, but the starting material already has an OH on C1, so when Br adds across C1 and C2, the OH would still be present on C1, making the product have Br on C1 and C2, and OH on C1. So that would be 1,2-dibromo-1-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylcyclopentane.

But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So the compound is a cyclopentanol (OH on the ring) with Br on 1 and 2. So that matches the product I was thinking.

Now, about the stereochemistry. The addition of Br2 across a double bond is a trans addition. So in the starting material, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Depending on the configuration, the Brs would add on opposite sides.

But in a ring structure, the stereochemistry can be a bit tricky. For example, if the starting enol has a certain configuration, the addition would lead to a specific stereochemistry in the product.

Assuming the starting material is such that the double bond is in a certain configuration, the addition of Br2 would lead to the Brs being trans.

But without knowing the starting configuration, it's hard to determine the exact R/S configuration in the product. However, the options provided have specific configurations, so the correct option must be one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the trans addition, leading to a specific stereoisomer. But since the options list both (1R,2S) and (1R,2R), I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the enol is a less substituted double bond. So when Br adds, the more substituted position (C1) would have a Br, and the adjacent C2 would have the other Br.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here.

Between the options, if the major product is the vicinal dibromide with the OH remaining, then option A or D is correct. The question is, which configuration.

I think the correct answer is option A, (1R,2S), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration isn't the main point, and the major outcome is the presence of two Brs on C1 and C2, making either A or D the correct option.

Wait, but looking back, the enol has the structure where C1 has the OH and the double bond is between C1 and C2. When Br2 adds, the Brs would add across C1 and C2. So the resulting product would have Brs on C1 and C2, and the OH on C1. So the product is a diol with two Brs.

So the options are A and D. Since the starting material is a cis or trans double bond, but without specific information, perhaps the question assumes a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer with Brs on opposite sides, which would correspond to a trans addition, leading to (1R,2S) configuration, as in option A.

Alternatively, maybe the product is (1R,2R), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when Br2 adds to a cyclopentene ring, the ring's substituents influence the approach. The bulky methyl groups are on C4, which is adjacent to C5 and C3. So when Br adds across C1 and C2, the approach of Br2 would be such that the methyl groups on C4 are on the same face, leading to a specific stereochemistry.

But I'm not confident enough to determine that.

Given the time I've spent, I think I have to make a decision. Based on the options, the major product is likely a vicinal dibromide with the OH group, making either A or D correct. Since the question is about the major outcome, perhaps the most straightforward addition is the correct path.

Therefore, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option A or D. But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R).

Wait, another thought: the addition of Br2 to a double bond leads to anti addition. So in the case of a cyclopentene ring, the Brs would add on opposite sides, making the product's configuration (1R,2S) because of the ring's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has both Brs on the same side, leading to (1R,2R), but I'm not certain.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to go with option A as the correct answer because the addition is trans, leading to the (1R,2S) configuration.


The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine involves the addition of bromine across the double bond in the enol structure. The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on carbon 1 and a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 in a five-membered cyclopentane ring. The two methyl groups are located on carbon 4.

When bromine (Br₂) reacts with the enol, it adds across the double bond between carbons 1 and 2. This results in the formation of a vicinal dibromide, where bromine atoms are added to carbons 1 and 2. The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 remains intact, and the product retains the cyclopentanol structure with bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 2. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the anti addition of bromine across the double bond, which is a trans addition.

The options provided include two dibrominated cyclopentanol products:  
- **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol  
- **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol  

The anti addition of bromine leads to the (1R,2S) configuration, as the bromine atoms add to opposite sides of the ring. This matches the description of **Option A**. Therefore, the major outcome of the reaction is the formation of (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Answer: A
