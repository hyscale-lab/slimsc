Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the sun and how their flux changes under a certain scenario. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about the Sun's energy production. The Sun primarily generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, right? The main process is the proton-proton chain, which has a few branches. I remember that the pp-I branch is the dominant one, but there's also pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. So I should focus on what that means for neutrino production.

Neutrinos are produced in several steps of the fusion process. In the proton-proton chain, one of the key steps is the fusion of two protons to form deuterium, which emits a positron and a neutrino. But wait, I think in the pp-I branch, two protons collide, one emits a positron and a neutrino, then another proton fuses to form helium-3. But in the pp-III branch, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the triple-alpha process, but wait no, triple-alpha is for helium into carbon, but that's a different part. Maybe the pp-III branch is where three helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the pp-III branch might involve the creation of beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to form boron-8, which decays and emits neutrinos. Oh wait, wait, the pp-III branch is part of the cycle that produces carbon via the CNO cycle?
