Okay, so I need to figure out the allowed decay channels of this boson X. Let's start by parsing the problem.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf barred psi f(y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should write it out more clearly. Oh wait, I think it's written as L = -λ f ψ† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this is an interaction term between the boson X and the fermions, right?

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find what fermions X can decay into, considering the mass.

First, the decay of X would involve it producing a pair of fermions, since the interaction seems to be with fermionic fields. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The possible fermions are quarks and leptons. But wait, the fermions available depend on the mass. The mass of X is 6 GeV. Each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known particles. Let's see:

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, the top quark is really heavy, about 173 GeV, so 6 GeV is way below that. So t is out. So possible quarks: u, d, s, c, b.

Leptons: electron (e), muon (mu), tau. Taus are heavy, around 1.78 GeV each. So a pair would be about 3.56 GeV. That's under 6 GeV. Electrons and muons are much lighter.

Wait, but for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So for each possible fermion f, 2m_f <= m_X.

So let's list the fermion masses:

- Up quark: about 2.2 MeV (so negligible)
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV (varies, but roughly 100)
- Charm: ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Tau lepton: ~1.78 GeV
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Muon neutrino is negligible, but we're talking about charged leptons here.

So for each fermion f, whether 2m_f <= 6 GeV.

For quarks:

- u: 2m_u ~ 4.4 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed
- d: 2m_d ~9.4 MeV → allowed
- s: ~200 MeV → allowed
- c: 2 * 1.3 GeV = 2.6 GeV ≤6 → allowed
- b: 2 *4.5 GeV =9 GeV → which is more than 6 GeV. So b quark pair would require 9 GeV, which X doesn't have. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, wait, wait. The mass of the X is 6 GeV. So if X is at rest, and it decays into a fermion pair, the maximum mass each fermion can have is up to 3 GeV each. Because 2m_f can't exceed 6 GeV. So for fermions with m_f less than or equal to 3 GeV, they can be produced.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct because the rest mass isn't the only consideration. The actual threshold is m_X must be >= 2m_f, because the minimum energy needed to produce the pair is 2m_f, when they are at rest.

So let's see which quarks
