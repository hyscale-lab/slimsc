Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. So when a planet orbits a star, the star moves a little bit back and forth, causing the spectral lines to shift. The shift can tell us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are roughly the same size and mass.

The RV method measures the shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, why is the shift different? Oh, right, the shift depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So a larger shift means the star is moving faster.

I think the formula involved here is the one that relates the velocity of the star (v) to the orbital period (P) of the planet. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/ (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the semi-amplitude K can be approximated as:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3) )) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the period. Since both stars are the same mass and the planets' masses are similar, maybe we can relate the velocities and periods.

Alternatively, the formula might relate the velocity amplitude K to the orbital period P. Let me think about Kepler's third law here because it relates the period to the masses and the semi-major axis.

Kepler's third law in the form for radial velocity is:

P² = (4π²
