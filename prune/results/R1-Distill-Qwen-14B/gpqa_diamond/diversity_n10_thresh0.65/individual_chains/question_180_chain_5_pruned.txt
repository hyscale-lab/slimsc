Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. Right, but all the charges are 2e, so each is 3.2e-19 C. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P.

Wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Oh right, in an isolated system, the potential energy is related to the configuration of the charges. The minimum energy would typically be when the charges are arranged in the most stable configuration, but I'm not sure if that applies here. No, wait, because all the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, so their positions are fixed relative to each other. So perhaps the only thing affecting the potential energy is the interaction between the 13th charge at P and the others, plus the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no, the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between all pairs. So I need to calculate U_total = U between the 13th charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all
