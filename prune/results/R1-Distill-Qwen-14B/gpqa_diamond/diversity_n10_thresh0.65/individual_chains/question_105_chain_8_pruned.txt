Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about starspots and exoplanets. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question is asking about the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as a star with spots. 

Wait, the star in question has a radius equal to the Sun's, right? So Rstar is R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a 20% filling factor. Oh wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So each hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times half the surface area. 

The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are cooler because they have a temperature difference of 1000K. So spots are at 5000K, maybe? Oh wait, wait, the temperature difference is 1000K. So spots are either 5000 or 7000. But since they are called "dark spots", they must be cooler. So spots are 5000K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. This causes the observed brightness to dip as the spots rotate into our line of sight. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness proportional to the area blocked. But in this case, the star's own spots are causing the variation, and we need to find the planet radius that would mimic the same dip.

Wait, but the question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude. So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is what we need to compare to the amplitude caused by a planet transit.

So first, I think I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots. The star's total flux without spots is F_total = sigma * Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2) / (4π D^2) ), but wait, maybe more accurately, the flux per unit area is sigma Teff^4. So the total flux from the star is F = 4π Rstar² * sigma Teff^4 / (4π D^2) ) = sigma Teff^4 (Rstar^2 / D^2) ), but D is the distance, which cancels out when considering relative changes. So maybe I can think in terms of each area's contribution.

The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, the total flux from the star decreases. The change in flux (delta F) is the difference in flux from the spotted area and the unspotted area.

So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π Rstar^2) because a hemisphere is 2π steradians (since a sphere is 4π
