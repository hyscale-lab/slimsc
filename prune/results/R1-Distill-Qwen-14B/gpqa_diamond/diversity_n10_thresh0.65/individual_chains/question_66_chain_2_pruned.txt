Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options given are combinations of these, and I need to pick the right one.

First, let me remember what these symmetries mean. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. Poincaré symmetry goes a step further by including both Lorentz transformations and translations, so it's like the combination of Lorentz and translational symmetries. Then there's CP symmetry, which is charge conjugation (C) combined with parity (P). CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal.

Wait, I think all the operators in SMEFT must respect certain symmetries. But which ones are they? SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. But these operators have to maintain the same symmetries as the SM because SMEFT is built upon it.

I remember that the SM respects Lorentz symmetry. So any theory that's built on it, like SMEFT, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is definitely in.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré is more than just Lorentz; it includes translations in space and time. The SM definitely respects this. I believe SMEFT also respects Poincaré symmetry because it's part of the framework. So option 2 should be correct too.

Now, CP symmetry. The SM doesn't have all its operators respecting CP. For example, the CKM matrix in quark mixing leads to CP violation. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT shouldn't require operators to preserve that symmetry either. So option 3 (CP) is not a must.

Wait, but some SMEFT operators might individually respect CP? Or maybe the question is about all operators needing to respect these symmetries. Since the SM itself doesn't have all operators respecting CP, SMEFT's operators don't have to either. So we can rule out any options that include CP symmetry (like B or D).

CPT symmetry is a different story. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way the theory is constructed, CPT is a
