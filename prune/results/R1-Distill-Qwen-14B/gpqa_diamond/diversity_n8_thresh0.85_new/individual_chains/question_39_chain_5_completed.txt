Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The i is the imaginary unit, sqrt(-1). When measuring the position, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3, nowhere else.

The question is asking for the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalized. Normalization means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given here is a bit strange. Oh, wait, no, I think I can break it down. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function, which is fine. But for normalization, I need the integral of the probability density, which is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

So the probability density is ψ*(x) ψ(x). Let me compute that. The complex conjugate of ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying these together:

ψ*(x) * ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2 [i*(-i)] + [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(-0.5i) * [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(0.5i) ??? Wait, no, that's not the right way to multiply. I think I should just multiply the two expressions correctly.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it properly. Let me denote A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5i. So ψ = A + B. The complex conjugate is A* - B*, since B is imaginary. So ψ* = A - B* (since B is -0.5i, B* is 0.5i). So ψ* ψ = (A - B* )(A + B).

Expanding this, it's A² + A B + (-B* A) + (-B* B). Hmm, but since A is real, I think this simplifies. Let me think: A is a real function because a and x are real, and sqrt(1+x) is real. So A is real. So ψ = A + B, where B is imaginary.

Then ψ* = A - B. So ψ* ψ = (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B². Because (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B*B. So in this case:

A² is (a²)/(1+x).
B is 0.5i, so B² is (0.5i)^2 = (0.25)(-1) = -0.25.

Wait, no, wait. ψ* ψ = (A - B)(A + B) = A² - (B)^2. But B is -0.5i, so B squared is (-0.5i)^2 = (-0.5)^2 * (i^2) = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] - (-0.25) = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right. Or can it? Wait, no, because (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B². So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but that would make the probability density a real, positive function, which makes sense. So integrating this from x=1 to x=3 should give 1.

So the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me compute that integral.

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3, which is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate ln(2) approximately as 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me check the math again.

The wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. So when calculating |ψ|^2, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is A², and (0.5i)^2 is (i^2)(0.25) = -0.25, but when you subtract that when doing A² - B², wait no. No, I think I messed up earlier. Let me re-calculate that.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine the calculation.

Wait, the wave function is ψ = A + B, where A is real, and B is imaginary (B = -0.5i). Then ψ* = A - B.

So when you multiply ψ*ψ, you get (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B^2.

But B is (-0.5i), so B squared is (-0.5i)^2 = (0.25)(-1) = -0.25.

So ψ*ψ = A² - (-0.25) = A² + 0.25.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Then integrating this from x=1 to x=3 gives the normalization condition.

So the integral becomes [ a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 ] + [ ∫0.25 dx from 1 to3 ]

The first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

Adding them: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me just confirm if that's the correct approach.

Another thought: The wave function must be normalizable, but in this case, the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function is zero outside that region. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, but the modulus squared would be (a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25, which is always positive, but when x approaches -1, 1+x approaches 0, but since the particles are only found between x=1 and3, maybe the wave function is zero outside that region. But the question says that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3, implying the wave function is zero outside that interval. So in the given wave function, perhaps the expression holds only between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere.

Wait, but that complicates things. Because, in reality, the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle exists. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So perhaps I should consider that this expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But that's an assumption.

Wait, but the question says that when measuring, none were found outside, so the wave function must be zero outside. But the given wave function function is non-zero even when x is less than 1 or greater than3, unless it's confined. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem statement says that the wave function of each particle in a part of space where it can exist is given by that expression. So perhaps that expression is valid only in the region x between 1 and3, and zero elsewhere.

So in that case, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

But when computing the normalization integral, we only integrate from 1 to3.

So that's what I did earlier. So the calculation seems correct.

So the value of a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this region. The probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting the probability density:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \):  
   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
