Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me think through this step by step.

The setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. They added a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect into Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, the plus strand starts with 5' ATG... That's the start codon, methionine. So the construct should be expressed as a fusion protein with HA at the beginning.

Wait, but if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, the reading frame is important. Let me check the sequence after the ATG. The next codons would be TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), etc. Hmm, but wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence—how was it introduced? If there was a mistake in the HA tag, like a point mutation, that might cause a problem. But the question says that the issue is in the construct's sequence.

Looking at the DNA sequence, let me check if there are any stop codons present. Because if a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) appears early, the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Let me scan through the sequence. Starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AA GAA GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG AAA GCA CAG CCC GGC TGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA GTC TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC TCA CCT CGG CGG TCA GGC TGC TCA CTT GCC GGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC AGG AGG CGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAT TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA GAG CCC GCA GCG TTAA CGA CGG GTG CCA CAG CAT CAC CCT CCCC GAG TGA

Wait, looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let's go through the codons:

Looking for TGA. Let me parse the sequence into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG... Oh, wait, the 16th-18th nucleotides are TGA. So the 16th-18th nucleotides are positions 15-17 (if starting at 1 as ATG is 1-3). So that would be positions 15-17: AAA TGA. Let me count:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TAC

7-9: CCA

10-12: TAC

13-15: GAT

16-18: GTT (no, wait, wait. Wait, the DNA is written as 5' to 3', so each codon is read 5' to 3' as mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me rephrase: the given sequence is the plus (sense) strand. The mRNA would be complementary to the template (minus) strand, so the mRNA would be same as the plus strand except T becomes U.

So the mRNA sequence would be AUGC... etc. So translating the DNA's plus strand as mRNA, the codons would be ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA, etc.

Wait, so in the DNA sequence, the 13th to 15th bases are GAT (which is codon 5, GAT in DNA is CAT in mRNA, which is His). Then 16-18: GTT (GTT in DNA is GAA in mRNA, which is Glu). Then 19-21: CCA (GAG in mRNA, which is Glu). Wait, no, wait: the DNA is plus strand, so the mRNA is same as DNA except T→U.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recount the DNA sequence, looking for the triplet TGA. Because TGA is a stop codon. So in the DNA, the coding strand (plus) is used to make mRNA, so a TGA on the coding strand would be present in the mRNA as TGA, which is a stop codon.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG ...

So in the plus strand, the 12th-14th bases are AAA, and the next three are TGA. So the DNA sequence at that point is ...AAA TGA... So that would mean that in the mRNA, it's AAAAAUGA... Wait no, the mRNA would be complementary. Wait, no, actually, the mRNA is same as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

Wait, no. When the DNA is the coding (sense) strand, the mRNA is synthesized as a complement to the template (antisense) strand. So the mRNA sequence would be same as the coding (plus) strand, with T→U.

So the DNA sequence's plus strand has segments like ...AAA TGA..., so the mRNA would have ...AAU GAA... Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the coding (plus) strand is the same as the mRNA, except T→U. So the DNA sequence is 5' to 3': ...AAA TGA CTC TGG..., so the mRNA would be ...AAA UGA CUC UGG... Wait, no, because the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA would have same sequence but with U instead of T.

So, the mRNA would be ...AAA UGA... which is a stop codon (UGA is a stop codon).

So, in the DNA construct, the coding sequence includes a TGA triplet, which in the mRNA becomes UGA, a stop codon. Therefore, the ribosome would terminate translation early when it hits UGA, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

So the issue is that there's a stop codon in the coding sequence, which is causing premature termination of translation.

Looking at the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That fits because the stop codon would cause the ribosome to stop.

Wait, but why is there a stop codon in the construct? The researcher intended to overexpress GADD45G but perhaps a mutation introduced a TGA, or perhaps the construct was designed incorrectly.

Wait, the construct was modified to add the HA tag. But perhaps during the cloning, a mutation occurred. Alternatively, maybe the insert was in the wrong reading frame.

Wait, the question states that the reason was noticed in the sequence. So the sequence has a TGA stop codon, so the mRNA would have UGA, causing the ribosome to stop. So the correct answer would be B.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in mouse. But in this case, the stop codon is UGA, and all organisms have release factors for that. So D is not correct.

Option A: missense mutation in HA. But the problem is that the HA is at the N-terminus, and a mutation there might affect folding but not necessarily prevent expression. The problem here is lack of expression, so A is less likely.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. That would probably lead to lower levels of mature protein, but the construct isn't being expressed at all. If the protein is made but quickly degraded, you might not see it on a Western blot, but the cells would still produce it. The question says the expression level is low, so maybe that's a possibility. But in this case, the problem is the sequence has a premature stop codon, which would prevent full-length protein from being made.

So the correct answer should be B, because the ribosome stops at the UGA codon, leading to no or truncated protein.


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein fused with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus in a transgenic mouse model. However, the protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals the presence of a premature stop codon, UGA, in the mRNA. This stop codon arises from the triplet TGA in the DNA sequence, which is located early in the coding region. As a result, the ribosome terminates translation prematurely, preventing the production of the full-length protein.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag could affect protein function or detection but would not explain the complete lack of expression. The issue here is the premature stop codon, not a mutation in the HA tag.
- **Option B**: The presence of the UGA stop codon in the mRNA causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to the absence of full-length protein. This aligns with the observed lack of expression.
- **Option C**: A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would result in degradation of the nascent protein rather than a complete lack of expression. The issue here is the premature stop codon, not proteolysis.
- **Option D**: While tRNA availability is critical for translation, UGA is a conserved stop codon in all organisms, including mice, and is recognized by release factors. This does not explain the lack of expression.

The most plausible explanation is that the premature stop codon (UGA) in the mRNA causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the production of the full-length protein. 

Answer: B
