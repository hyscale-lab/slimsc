Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is being overexpressed. The researcher is using a plasmid with the coding sequence modified to include a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but they're not getting the expected overexpression. 

Looking at the given DNA sequence, it starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then, after that, I see the sequence TAC. Hmm, TAC is the codon for tyrosine. Wait, but the question mentions adding the hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. So maybe the coding sequence starts with that tag.

Wait, hemagglutinin is a protein from the influenza virus. The HA tag is commonly added to proteins for detection. The HA tag's sequence is usually something like YPYDVPDYA, but the exact nucleotide sequence would depend on the specific variant. But in this case, the problem says the construct introduces a single HA determinant at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the given sequence, the very beginning is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So after the ATG start codon, the next codon is TAC, which is Tyr. But wait, the HA tag's first amino acid is Y (tyrosine), right? So maybe that's correct. But wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence, so perhaps the nucleotides should encode that. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reading frame. The plasmid is designed to add the HA tag before GADD45G. So the construct would be: HA-tag coding sequence followed by GADD45G. 

But looking at the sequence provided, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr) again. So that would be Tyr-Pro-Tyr... Hmm, the HA tag is typically longer than that. Oh wait, maybe the problem is that the start is correct, but perhaps the construct has a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated.

Wait, the sequence ends with TGA. Let me check. The sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. TGA is a stop codon. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the construct might be introducing a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be shorter than expected. 

Wait, but looking at the entire sequence, how long is it? Let me count. The given sequence is 5' to 3', starts with ATG and ends with TGA. So the entire sequence is the coding sequence for the HA-tagged GADD45G. If the last codon is a stop, that's normal. But wait, perhaps the HA tag is not correctly added, causing a problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stop codon comes before the end of the GADD45G sequence, meaning that the construct is truncated. But the problem says that the researcher's construct is unable to overexpress the protein. So why is that?

Alternatively, looking at the sequence, perhaps the initial ATG is followed by TAC, which is Tyr. But the HA tag's first amino acid is Tyr, so that matches. But perhaps the HA tag is not correctly included. Wait, maybe the HA tag's coding sequence is not present properly. For example, if the HA tag's nucleotides were not correctly added, leading to a frame shift or a wrong amino acid, the protein might not be expressed correctly.

Wait, another aspect: the construct's sequence. If the HA tag is placed at the N-terminus, which is the beginning of the coding sequence, the construct should have the HA coding before the GADD45G coding. So the plasmid's coding sequence should start with HA, then GADD45G.

But looking at the given sequence, the start is ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr, which is correct for HA), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr) again. Wait, HA's typical amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. So the first three codons would be TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), which matches YPY as the first three amino acids. So that seems correct.

Hmm, but if the entire construct is correct, why is the protein not overexpressed? Oh, wait, perhaps looking for an in-frame stop codon elsewhere. Let me go through the sequence.

Looking for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) within the coding sequence. The sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop. So the last codon is the stop. But maybe there's an earlier stop codon causing the protein to terminate early.

Let me scan through the sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the sequence:

After the initial TAC, CCA, TAC, etc., I see:

...TGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, I spot a TGA towards the end, which is the last codon. So the construct is correctly ending with a stop. But wait, within the sequence, is there any other TGA or TAA or TAG?

Looking for TGA in the middle: Let me scan.

I see "CTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC..."

Ah, here's a TGA in the middle: T G A A C G T... So the sequence is TGAACG. So the TGA is a stop codon here. Oh no! So in the middle, there's a TGA, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early.

So the coding sequence has an internal stop codon. That's a problem because the ribosome would stop translating at that point, producing a truncated protein. So the HA tag and part of the GADD45G might be expressed, but the whole protein isn't because the stop codon is in the middle.

So the sequence has an internal stop codon, causing premature termination.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says, "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That makes sense because the construct has a premature stop codon.

Other options:

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. Well, the HA tag's first few codons look correct, but if the HA itself has a mutation, it might not bind the antibody, but the construct would still express the protein. However, the main issue here is the lack of overexpression, which could be due to the truncation.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If the protein was expressed but degraded, the level would be low, but the construct would still produce some. Here, the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, so this is less likely.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, the stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. The tRNA for these are release factors. In the mouse, the translation machinery would recognize these. So if the stop codon is present in the mRNA, it would be recognized regardless of the organism's tRNA presence because it's the ribosome that decodes them. So option D is probably incorrect.

So the issue is that the construct has an internal stop codon (TGA) in the middle, leading the ribosome to terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed as intended.


The question involves a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is modified to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus for overexpression. The construct is designed to express the HA-tagged GADD45G protein, but the researcher observes no successful overexpression. The provided DNA sequence is analyzed to identify the issue.

The sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and includes the HA tag sequence (TAC CCA TAC, corresponding to Tyr-Pro-Tyr). This matches the expected beginning of the HA tag. However, upon closer inspection, an internal stop codon (TGA) is found in the middle of the sequence. This premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein instead of the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G protein. This explains the lack of overexpression.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:**  
  While the HA tag's first few codons appear correct, the primary issue is the premature stop codon, not a mutation in the HA tag itself. This option is unlikely.

- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:**  
  The presence of an internal stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the sequence is the root cause of the problem. This causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, leading to the production of a truncated protein. This option is correct.

- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:**  
  Proteolysis would degrade the protein after it is expressed, but the issue here is the absence of full-length protein expression. This option is unlikely.

- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:**  
  Stop codons (TGA, TAA, TAG) are recognized by release factors in the ribosome, independent of the presence of specific tRNAs. This option is incorrect.

The correct answer is that the premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length protein.

**Answer: B**
