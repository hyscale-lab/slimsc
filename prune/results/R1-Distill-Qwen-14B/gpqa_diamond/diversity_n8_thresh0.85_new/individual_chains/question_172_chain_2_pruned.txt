Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in LTE, the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds, so the distribution of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the ratio of the populations is n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the number in star_1 and n2 in star_2. 

The energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. But I think the actual value of ΔE might not be directly needed for finding the relation between T1 and T2 because the problem is more about the ratio of the populations.

Boltzmann's equation says that the ratio of populations is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant. So n1/n2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Wait, but wait, actually, the excited state and ground state? Or is it the other way around? Because the excited state has higher energy. Let me clarify. Suppose level E2 is higher than E1. Then, n2/n1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So the excited state has lower population because it's higher in energy. But in this case, n1 is twice as excited as n2. Wait, wait the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps n1 is the number in the excited state, and n2 is the same in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2. That ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So the equation is:

n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but wait no, wait. Let me think again. The Boltzmann distribution is given by the ratio of populations as n_i/n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Assuming E_i is the higher energy level. So if ΔE is E_upper - E_lower, then for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state would be n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Hmm, but in this question, it's about the ratio of the same transition in two different stars. So star_1 has n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper, perhaps? Or wait, perhaps the question is about the same transition between two levels. Let me see.

Oh wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So star_1's excited level is twice that of star_2's. So for each star, the ratio would be (n_upper/n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star_1, ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. The excited state is E2. So in star_1, the number of atoms in E2 is n1, and in star_2, it's n2. The question says n1 = 2 * n2. So the ratio for star_1 is (n1)/(n_lower) = 2 * (n2)/(n_lower), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps each star has its own ratio of n_upper to n_lower, and the ratios are related.

Wait, perhaps each star has its own ratio. So for star_1, the ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's (n_upper')/(n_lower') = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But in the question, it's stated that the excited state (upper level) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n_upper_1 = 2 * n_upper_2. Hmm, but without knowing the lower level's population, it's tricky. Alternatively, the ratio (n_upper)/(n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, the question says that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio (n_upper)/(n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model it step by step.

For star 1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )   ...(1)

For star 2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )   ...(2)

But the question says that in star_1, the upper level is twice as excited as in star_2. Wait
