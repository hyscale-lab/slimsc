Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound D. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions starting from Compound A. Let's start with that.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration gives the number of protons in each signal. Also, the splitting (triplet and quartet) can tell me about neighboring protons.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H probably indicates two equivalent CH3 groups. Because a triplet could mean each CH3 is next to another group with two protons. Wait, or maybe each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2. Wait, let's think: the triplet for 6H suggests each of the two CH3 groups is split by a neighboring CH2 group, which has 2H. Because when a CH3 is next to a CH2, the CH3 protons will split into a quartet, but wait, no. Wait, that might not be right. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet for 6Hâ€”so each of these two CH3 groups is next to a group that has two neighboring protons. Wait, maybe each CH3 is attached to a CH2 group, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. Because when a CH3 is next to a CH2, each of the CH3 protons would see the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet (n+1, where n=2). So the CH3 would be a triplet. But wait, the CH3's integration is 6H, so two CH3 groups. So the structure could be two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. But wait, then the other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. That's 4H, so maybe another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the CH3s.

Let me visualize. Maybe the structure is (CH3)2CH-CH2-something. No, wait, let's think of a molecule where there are two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2, and those CH2s are next to another CH2. So perhaps something like (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH2-. Wait, but that's four CH2 groups? No, wait, the quartet is for 4H, so possibly two CH2 groups in a row.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2 group, which is next to another CH2. So like CH2CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that wouldn't quite fit. Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group? Like CH2CH2 connected in some way.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two equivalent CH3 groups. Each of those CH3 is next to a CH2 group, perhaps. Because the splitting is a triplet, which would come from two neighboring protons. So the CH3 is next to a CH2 with two Hs. So maybe each CH3 is attached to a CH2, which then is attached to another CH2 group. So the structure could be like CH2CH3-CH2-CH2-CH
