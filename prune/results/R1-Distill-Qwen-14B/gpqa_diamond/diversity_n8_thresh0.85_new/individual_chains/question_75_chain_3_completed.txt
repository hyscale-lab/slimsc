Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break down what's going on here.

The researcher is using Chinese hamster ovary cells to transfect a plasmid that's supposed to overexpress the GADD45G gene with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine for transfection and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't being expressed as expected.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to check for possible issues. The sequence is the plus strand, starting with ATG, which is the start codon. The first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Hmm, wait a second. The ATG is the start, but the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. But wait, the addition was a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should start with the HA tag, then GADD45G.

Wait, HA is a peptide from influenza hemagglutinin. The coding sequence for HA is usually around 11 amino acids. Let me recall the HA tag sequence. The HA tag is typically encoded by the sequence: YPYDVPDYA, but sometimes just the first part, like YPY. But wait, in the given DNA sequence, does the HA tag come right after the start codon?

Wait, the first part of the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT... Let me translate this into amino acids. ATG is methionine. TAC is tyrosine. CCA is proline. TAC is tyrosine again. GAT is aspartic acid. So the sequence starts Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp... Hmm, that doesn't look like the HA tag. Because HA is something like YPYD or similar. Wait, maybe I should check the reading frame.

Wait, the first codon is ATG, which is correct. Then TAC is next. So the HA tag should be right after the start. If the HA tag isn't present, perhaps the construct was inserted in the wrong orientation. Or maybe there's a frameshift or a premature stop codon.

Looking at the sequence, I don't see a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the first part. But wait, let me check the entire sequence for in-frame stop codons. Let's parse the DNA.

The sequence is long, but let's look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets in the same reading frame. The reading frame is from the start codon, ATG, so every 3 nucleotides.

Looking at the first part:
5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Wait, here I see TGA as the next codon. Oh, wait! Let me check that. Let's look at the DNA sequence in triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... 

So after the start codon ATG, the next codon is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (Stop). Oh wait, so right after the start, after a few codons, there's a TGA, which is a stop codon. That would mean the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein.

So the problem here is that the construct has a premature stop codon. That would prevent the full-length protein from being expressed. So the researcher is probably getting a truncated protein, which might not function, hence no overexpression.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That's what this situation points to. The premature stop codon is causing the ribosome to stop before the full protein is made.

Other options: A) Missense in HA sequence—doesn't seem to be the case since the HA isn't even present. The HA tag isn't in the sequence? Wait, the HA should be added at the N-terminus, which is before the GADD45G coding sequence. But the given DNA sequence starts with ATG, then has TAC, which doesn't look like HA. Wait, perhaps the HA wasn't correctly inserted.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted but then the GADD45G sequence has an early stop. So the construct includes the HA tag, but the translation is stopped early because of the TGA.

Wait, but the given sequence is the construct's coding sequence, so if HA was added, it should be at the beginning. But looking at the sequence, it starts with ATG, then a few codons, then TGA. So the HA tag isn't present. Oh wait, perhaps the HA was inserted but due to a mutation, it's messed up, but the given sequence doesn't have the HA.

Wait, the problem says the construct was modified to add the HA at the N-terminus. So the correct sequence should have the HA's coding sequence right after the start codon.

But in the given sequence, the coding starts with Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp etc., which is not the HA. So what's the issue here?

Wait, in the plus strand, the sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that's the coding sequence, and the HA should be first. So perhaps the HA wasn't added correctly. Or perhaps the construct has the HA but the sequence in the question doesn't show it. Wait, maybe the HA is included in the initial part.

Wait, perhaps when the HA was added, the cloning introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence was inserted in the wrong frame, but that might not introduce a stop codon so quickly.

Wait, another possibility is that the stop codon is in the correct frame. Let me count: the DNA sequence after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Each codon is correct. So the first codon is ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), G... So until the 10th codon or so, there's a TGA.

Wait, let's count the codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. TAC (Tyr)
10. GCC (Ala)
11. AAA (Lys)
12. TGA (stop)

So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would terminate at the 12th codon, making it very short.

So why is there a stop codon in the middle? Because perhaps the inserted HA sequence wasn't done correctly, or the construct has a frameshift or an incorrect insertion leading to a stop.

Wait, the HA tag is an addition. So the correct construct should have the HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G. If the HA wasn't added, then the GADD45G starts right with ATG, but in that case, the HA isn't present. But according to the question, the HA should be present. So perhaps the HA was added but in the wrong way. Or perhaps during cloning, the HA was inserted in a way that introduced a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was not correctly ligated, so the construct's coding starts with GADD45G without the HA. But according to the problem, the HA was added. So perhaps the HA was added but the cloning introduced a stop codon.

Another possibility is that the HA was inserted but due to a mutation, it introduced a stop codon. For example, a point mutation in the HA sequence might change a codon into a stop.

Wait, the question states that the researcher introduced a sequence for a single HA determinant at the N-terminus. So the construct should have HA followed by GADD45G. But in the provided DNA sequence, the coding doesn't start with the HA. So that suggests that the HA wasn't inserted correctly.

But looking again, the problem says the researcher 'modified the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza HA'. So in the construct, the HA is added as an N-terminal addition.

Thus, the correct construct should start with HA coding, then GADD45G coding.

But the given sequence doesn't show the HA. So perhaps during the cloning, the HA wasn't inserted, leading to the original GADD45G coding starting right after the start codon. But why would that cause a stop so early?

Wait, perhaps the GADD45G's own sequence has a stop codon early on. But that can't be, because GADD45G is a known gene, and its coding sequence doesn't have such a stop codon so early.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the cloning process introduced a stop codon. Let's imagine that the HA was inserted, but due to a mistake in the cloning, the reading frame was shifted, leading to a stop codon.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, then the next codons as above, which includes a stop. So perhaps the HA was not inserted, and the construct starts with GADD45G, but the GADD45G sequence has a stop codon in the first 30 or so nucleotides.

But wait, the original GADD45G gene's coding sequence shouldn't have a premature stop. So maybe during the cloning, the researcher inserted extra nucleotides that introduced a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid has a promoter and the start codon, but the insert is in the wrong orientation, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the researcher added the HA tag but forgot to include a Kozak sequence or a proper ribosome binding site, causing the ribosome to terminate early. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the options given include option B, which says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the coding sequence, which there is—the TGA after the 12th codon.

So that's probably the issue. The construct includes a premature stop codon, so the protein isn't being expressed in full length.

Looking at the options, option B is the correct answer: the ribosome terminated the translation early because of the stop codon.


The researcher is attempting to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag in a transgenic mouse model. However, the protein is not being expressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand shows that the coding sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and includes a premature stop codon (TGA) at the 12th codon. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein that is not functional for the intended purpose.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence is unlikely because the HA tag does not appear in the provided sequence. The sequence starts directly with the GADD45G coding region, suggesting the HA tag was not correctly incorporated.
- **Option B:** The premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to the production of a truncated protein. This aligns with the observed issue of failed overexpression.
- **Option C:** Proteolysis due to the lack of a linker sequence is not supported by the data, as the issue appears to be at the translation level, not post-translational modification.
- **Option D:** The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant here, as the premature stop codon is TGA, not UAA.

The most plausible explanation is that the premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed.

Answer: B
