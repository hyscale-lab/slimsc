Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transits occur when a planet passes in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. 

The question says that both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. 

Wait, so the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the ratio. But wait, isn't there more to it? Oh right, the inclination of the orbit matters too. The probability also depends on the alignment—so the chance is higher if the orbit is edge-on. 

But both planets have circular orbits, but I don't think that affects the probability directly. The main factors are the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. Wait, no, the orbital distance affects the size of the orbit, which in turn affects the chances of the planet passing in front of us. 

Wait, the probability of transit is given by (R_planet + R_star) divided by the orbital distance, but I'm not sure. Or is it something like (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here. 

Alternatively, the transit probability can be thought of as the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, but I might be mixing it up. Wait, actually, I think the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else?), or maybe it's (R_star / a) squared? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned. 

Wait, I think the formula for the geometric probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can approximate it as R_star / a. So the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a), right? 

So, for each planet, the probability depends on the star's radius and the planet's orbital period. But wait, how do we get the semi-major axis from the orbital period? Using Kepler's third law. 

Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (M_star) / (4π²), but actually, the exact form is a³ = [G(M_star + M_planet) * P²]/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. 

So, a³ ∝ M_star * P². Therefore, a = [M_star * P²]^(1/3). 

So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3). 

Now, let's compute a for both planets. 

Planet_1: 

M1 = 2 M2 (since its star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star). 
P1 = (1/3) P2. 

So a1 ∝ (2)^(1/3) * ( (1/3) P2 )^(2/3) 

Let me compute this. Let's factor out P2, since it's a proportionality. 

a1 ∝ 2^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) 

Similarly, a2 ∝ (1)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3) 

So the ratio a1/a2 is [2^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3)] / [1 * 1] 

Which simplifies to 2^(1/3) * (3^-2/3) 

Wait, 2^(1/3) is cube root of 2, approximately 1.26. 3^(2/3) is cube root of 9, about 2.08. So 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^(2/3)= ~2.08. 

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. 

So a1 is smaller than a2. 

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. 

But both stars have the same radius, R. So the probability for each planet is (R/a). 

Therefore, probability is inversely proportional to a. Since a1 is ~0.606 a2, the probability for Planet_1 is higher. 

Because a1 is smaller, so (R/a1) is larger. 

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than for Planet_2. 

Wait, let me compute the ratio. 

Probability_1 / Probability_2 = (a2)/(a1) 

Because P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2. So P1/P2 = a2/a1. 

We have a1 = 0.606 a2. So a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. 

Therefore, researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting. 

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher, but our calculation is ~1.65. 

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability of a transit is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius \( R_{\text{star}} \) to the planet's orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius, the key factor is the orbital distance \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), we calculate the orbital distance \( a \) for each planet. For Planet_1, the host star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)). Substituting these values:

\[
a_1 \propto (M_1)^{1/3} \cdot (P_1)^{2/3} = (2)^{1/3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3}
\]

\[
a_2 \propto (M_2)^{1/3} \cdot (P_2)^{2/3} = 1 \cdot P_2^{2/3}
\]

The ratio of the orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(2)^{1/3} \cdot (3^{-2/3})}{1} = 2^{1/3} \cdot 3^{-2/3}
\]

Approximating \( 2^{1/3} \approx 1.26 \) and \( 3^{2/3} \approx 2.08 \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbital distance is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is higher. The ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this analysis, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.
