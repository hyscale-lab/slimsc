Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope. The green comes from the eGFP, right? So the question is why the eGFP isn't showing up.

First, let's understand the setup. They have a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, so two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. So the ligand and receptor are on the same vector.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to the translation of the second ORF, even if the first one isn't translated. So when the vector is transfected into cells, the ligand is expressed because of the CBA promoter. The receptor, well, maybe it's expressed when the IRES is active, but I think IRES typically follows the first coding sequence. Wait, no, in bicistronic vectors, the first gene is under a strong promoter, and the second is under IRES. So the receptor might be expressed only if the first gene is translated, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF at 5', and the receptor at 3'. So the promoter is for the ligand, right? So the ligand is expressed. The receptor might need the IRES to be expressed. So the vector is designed such that the ligand is first, followed by the IRES, then the receptor, and then eGFP. But wait, the description says that between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is another lox2272-stop-lox2272. So the ligand is followed by a stop cassette, meaning that without Cre, the stop will prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor has a stop cassette before eGFP.

So when the vector is introduced into cells, without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop cassette prevents mCherry from being made. The receptor's expression depends on the IRES. So in normal conditions, the first ORF (ligand) is expressed, then the ribosome might drop off and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, or is the IRES part of the receptor's expression? In a bicistronic vector, the first gene is under a promoter, and the second gene is under an IRES. So the promoter drives the first gene, and the IRES allows the second gene to be expressed, often without the need for a second promoter. So in this case, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand stop cassette.

Wait, the vector is ligand (under CBA), then a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. Then, after that, the receptor is present, but upstream there's an IRES. Hmm, maybe I need to draw this out.

So the vector would be: CBA promoter â†’ ligand
