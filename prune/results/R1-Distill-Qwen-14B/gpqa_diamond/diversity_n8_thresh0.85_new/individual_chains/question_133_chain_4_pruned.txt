Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I should convert to liters because molarity is in mol/L. So 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters, right?

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphate salts, so I think they'll dissociate in water to form phosphate ions. But wait, the form of phosphate depends on the pH, which is influenced by these salts.

First, I need to find the moles of each compound. Let's start with KH2PO4. Its molecular weight (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1 divided by 136 is roughly 0.00735 moles. Wait, more precisely, 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007327 mol.

Next is Na2HPO4·2H2O. The Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99. Let me compute that: 1/177.99 is about 0.00561 mol. So each salt contributes some phosphate ions, but what form?

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 has three dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 =7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So in solution, the phosphate species are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and perhaps some H3PO4 if it hasn't all dissociated.

But when you have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they can act as a buffer. The pH of the solution will determine which form is predominant.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? Or maybe PO4^3-? No, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's deprotonated, the species are H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). So the question is asking for [HPO4^2-]?

Hmm, the question says "orthophosphate ions." Wait, maybe I should double-check. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and orthophosphate is the anion, which can be H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. So the question is probably asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suppliers. So the solution may be a buffer solution because it's a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-).

To find the concentration of HPO4^2-, perhaps I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Because the pH will be determined by the pKa2, since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the conjugate acid-base pair.

Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

But wait, in this case, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. So the ratio of their concentrations will determine the pH.

Wait, but the problem is, the solution's pH will affect how much of each phosphate species is present. However, since we're adding both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they will set the pH to the pKa2 of H
