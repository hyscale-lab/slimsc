Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass. Let's see what the question says. So, there's a light beam moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. Now, in this case, the glass is moving. So I think I need to consider the relative motion of the glass and the light.

Wait, so I'm probably going to have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Because the glass is moving, and the light is in the glass, so their velocities are not just additive in a classical way. Oh right, because in classical mechanics, you could add velocities linearly, but that doesn't hold at high speeds.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but wait, I think that's when you're adding the speed of the medium's frame to the speed of the object in that frame. Let me think.

Wait, the light is moving through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Alternatively, maybe I should model the problem by considering the lab frame and
