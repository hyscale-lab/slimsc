Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stochiometric—oh, right, that means the molar ratio is 1:1. So, each Ca ion is bound by one EDTA molecule, I think. And the temperature is 25°C, which probably affects the K value, but here they've given the K as 5x10^10, so maybe I don't need to worry about temperature affecting it further.

The problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So, when EDTA is involved, it's usually a complexation reaction. The reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2–. Right, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and forms complexes with metal ions.

The formation constant, K, for this complex is given as 5e10. Oh wait, K here is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaEDTA^2–]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4–])

But wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. And assuming that the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its deprotonated form, so it can fully complex the calcium.
