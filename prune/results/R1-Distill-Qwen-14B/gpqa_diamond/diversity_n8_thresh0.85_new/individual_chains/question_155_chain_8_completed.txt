Okay, so I've got this problem about uncertainty in quantum mechanics. The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of the operator P_z in a given state. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state is a 3-component vector. The operator P_z is given, right? Let me check the matrix for P_z. Oh, right, it's a diagonal matrix with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ) on the diagonal. So the matrix looks like:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because in this basis, the expectation value of P_z is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues.

Wait, the given state is a column vector. Let me denote it as |ψ⟩. The components are ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2), ψ₃ = -1/2.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. So the first component (ψ₁) corresponds to eigenvalue ħ, the second (ψ₂) to 0, and the third (ψ₃) to -ħ.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |ψ_i|² multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. So let's compute that.

|ψ₁|² is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by ħ gives (1/4)ħ.

|ψ₂|² is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. Multiply by 0 gives 0.

|ψ₃|² is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Multiply by (-ħ) gives (-1/4)ħ.

Adding them together: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So the eigenvalues for P_z² would be (ħ)^2, 0^2, and (-ħ)^2. So  ħ², 0, and ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is |ψ₁|²*(ħ²) + |ψ₂|²*(0) + |ψ₃|²*(ħ²).

Calculating each term: 

|ψ₁|² * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ².

|ψ₃|² * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, but wait, the expectation value of P_z is zero, so ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0) ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ. Which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking back at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the uncertainty should be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The state is a column vector, and we are in the eigenbasis of P_z, so the state can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. Each component's square gives the probability of being in that eigenstate.

So the probability of being in the first eigenstate (eigenvalue ħ) is | -1/2 |^2 = 1/4.

Third eigenstate (-ħ) is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The middle state is 1/2, but with eigenvalue 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0, as I thought.

⟨P_z²⟩ is the expectation of P_z squared, which is (ħ^2)*(1/4) + 0*(1/2) + (ħ^2)*(1/4) )= (1/4 + 1/4)*ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but another thought: the operator P_z is diagonal in this basis, so when you compute the expectation value, it's just the sum of probabilities times the eigenvalues. So yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I were to compute it using matrix multiplication, I could write |ψ⟩^† P_z |ψ⟩ and |ψ⟩^† P_z^2 |ψ⟩, but since P_z is diagonal, it's easier to compute as I did before.

So yeah, the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$
The given state is the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $| \psi_1 |^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $| \psi_2 |^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $| \psi_3 |^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, so its eigenvalues are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty in $P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
