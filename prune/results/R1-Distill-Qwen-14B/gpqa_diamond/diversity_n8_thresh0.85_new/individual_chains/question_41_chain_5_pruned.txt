Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

Alright, the problem says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the index of refraction, so in the glass, the speed would normally be c/n. But wait, since the glass is moving, does that affect the speed as observed in the lab?

Wait, no, wait. Because according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But in a medium, the speed is different. But wait, how does the motion of the medium affect it? Oh, right, when the medium is moving, how does that influence the measured speed? Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. If the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is going through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion, then from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, in the frame of the glass (the rest frame of the glass), the light's speed is c/n, right? Because the glass is the medium, so light slows down to c/n. But then the glass is moving, so we need to transform this speed into the lab frame.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's a simple addition. Like, if the glass is moving at speed v, and the light is moving at u in the glass's frame, then in the lab frame, would it be u + v?

Wait, no, that's only when you're dealing with velocities in Newtonian mechanics, but light doesn't add that way. Because according to relativity, velocities don't just add linearly when approaching the speed of light.

Wait a minute, but wait, the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which is less than c. So perhaps we can treat it using the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ² ). Here, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab.

Wait,
