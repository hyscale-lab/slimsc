Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to figure out what the concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. So, initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add another 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. 

To find the new concentration, I can use the dilution formula: C1V1 = C2V2. Here, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³. So, C2 = (C1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = (1) /40? Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1; 1 /40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence.

The moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) is 0.001 moles. So the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. That would be 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH used.

Wait, no. Wait, the 25% titration refers to the percentage of the acetic acid that's been neutralized. So, in terms of moles, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

So, for 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 moles. So 0.00025 moles. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. That makes sense.

So, for the 25% titration point, we have a solution where part of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate ion). 

I think I should approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the 25% point. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So, the ratio [A-]/[HA] would be 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = (0.25) / (0.75) = 1/3.

So, pH = pKa + log(1/3). Let's compute pKa first. The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e
