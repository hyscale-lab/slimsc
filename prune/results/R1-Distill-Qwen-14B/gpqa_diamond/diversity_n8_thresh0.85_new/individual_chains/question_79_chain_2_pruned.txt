Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound X based on some NMR data after a reaction. Alright, let's break down the problem.

First, let's read the question carefully. Compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to find out what X is from the options.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used for the Sharpless epoxidation. Wait, no, Sharpless uses a different reagent... Or maybe it's another kind of oxidation. Wait, no, Sharpless epoxidation uses a titanium-based catalyst with other oxidizing agents. Alternatively, 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is part of the conditions for epoxidation, possibly in the Prilezhaev oxidation or something else. Wait, no, Sharpless epoxidation uses a titanium-based catalyst with a peracid. Hmm, maybe the reaction here is an epoxidation of a double bond?

Wait, the reaction conditions: nonpolar solvent, 403 K (which is about 130°C), for a day. So maybe it's an epoxidation of a styryl group (which has a conjugated diene or an alkene) to form an epoxide. So the product is an epoxide.

So, compound X is something that, upon reaction, becomes an epoxide. So X is an alkene that upon treatment with this reagent becomes an epoxide. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, but all options except A and B seem to have an oxirane ring, which is an epoxide. So if X is reacting to form an epoxide, perhaps X is an alkene which upon epoxidation becomes the product. Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So maybe compound X is the alkene, and the product is the epoxide. Or wait, maybe X is the epoxide already, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction is with a reagent that forms epoxides. So I think X is the starting alkene, and the product is the epoxide.

So the product is an epoxide, and the NMR data is of the epoxide. Let's look at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, so there are two singlets, each integrating to 3H. So two methyl groups. One at 2.28 and another at 2.31. That's very close together. They're both singlets, so no neighboring protons. Maybe they're both methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric position.

Then, the aromatic protons: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Hmm, the doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. Let me think about a benzene ring substitution pattern.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents causing the splitting. Or perhaps it's a styrene-type structure, where the substituents are in certain positions.

Wait, but the product is an epoxide, so the structure would have an epoxide ring attached to a benzene ring (styrene oxide, perhaps). Let's think about how the epoxide affects the NMR.

In epoxides, the two protons adjacent to the oxygen are usually deshielded and can appear as a doublet or other splitting, depending on the substitution. But in the product's 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are more prominent. The two singlet methyl groups might be attached to carbons adjacent to the epoxide.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, the 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon. Wait, but epoxides are ethers, not ketones. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken. Or wait, the 197.7 could be an epoxide carbon. Wait, no, typical epoxide carbons are around 50-70 ppm. Wait, maybe that's the carbonyl from something else. Hmm, perhaps a carbonyl group is present in the molecule.

Wait, but in the product, if X was just an alkene that formed an epoxide, the product would have an epoxide ring. But where's the carbony
