Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I remember that in scattering experiments, especially in nuclear physics, phase shifts are involved when dealing with partial waves. 

The given phase shifts are δ0 = 90 degrees, δ1 = 67 degrees, δ2 = 55 degrees, δ3 = 30 degrees, and δ4 = 13 degrees. Oh wait, and the rest are ignored. So I guess we only consider up to l=4 here.

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) in the case of elastic scattering can be expressed using partial waves and phase shifts. 

I remember the formula for the scattering amplitude is given by a sum over all the partial waves. Each term involves the spherical Bessel functions and the phase shifts. The general form is something like:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) [ e^{iδl} sin δl ] P_l(cosθ) )

Wait, but wait a second. Because the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, wait, the incident direction is along θ=0 degrees. So I think that when θ is 0, cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) = 1. That's right. So each term in the sum will be (2l +1) e^{iδl} sin δl * 1.

But wait, the amplitude is given by (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum. So the imaginary part would be the imaginary part of this sum, then multiplied by 1/(2ik). Hmm, but wait, let's think about this.

Wait, let me write the expression again. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) ( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) P_l(cosθ) ]

But when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) = 1. So each term becomes (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. So the sum is Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But e^{iδ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when you multiply that by sin δ_l, you get sin δ_l [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So each term contributes a real part (sin δ_l cos δ_l) and an imaginary part (sin² δ_l). So the sum over l would be sum_real + i sum_imaginary.

Then, the entire f(θ=0) is [sum_real + i sum_imaginary] * (1/(2ik)).

But wait, 1/(2ik) can be written as (1/(2i)) * (1/k), and 1/(i) is -i. So 1/(2i) = -i/(2). So 1/(2ik) = (-i)/(2k).

So putting it together, f = [sum_real + i sum_imag] * (-i)/(2k).

Let me compute this multiplication. Multiply each part:

sum_real * (-i)/(2k) → -i sum_real/(2k)
i sum_imag * (-i)/(2k) → [i*(-i)] sum_imag/(2k) → [1] sum_imag/(2k)

Because i*(-i) is 1.

So the imaginary part of f comes from the real part of the sum and the imaginary part of the sum. Let me clarify:

The term -i sum_real/(2k) contributes to the imaginary part of f, since it's multiplied by i. And the term sum_imag/(2k) is real.

So the imaginary part of f is Im(f) = [sum_imag/(2k)] - [sum_real/(2k)]?

Wait, wait, maybe I confused which parts contribute. Let me think again.

Wait, f = [sum_real + i sum_imag] * (-i)/(2k)

Let me distribute:

= sum_real*(-i)/(2k) + i sum_imag*(-i)/(2k)

= (-i sum_real)/(2k) + (-i^2 sum_imag)/(2k)

But i^2 is -1, so:

= (-i sum_real)/(2k) + (sum_imag)/(2k)

So f is equal to (sum_imag)/(2k) + (-i sum_real)/(2k). 

So in terms of real and imaginary parts:

Real part: sum_imag/(2k)
Imaginary part: (- sum_real)/(2k)

Wait, but the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So Im(f) is (- sum_real)/(2k).

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mess up the signs. Let's compute the product again.

Let me compute the
