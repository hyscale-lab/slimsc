Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning there's a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. These chiral centers make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers which are optically active.

The question gives four moieties, and I need to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - Biphenyls can have different isomerism types. The substituents are on the para positions maybe? Wait, the positions are 2 and 2', so each phenyl ring has a substituent at position 2 relative to the connecting carbon.
   - The molecule has two methyl ester groups and two nitro groups. Are there any stereogenic centers here? Let me visualize it. Each phenyl ring is attached at the 1-position, so the substituents are on the same carbon? No, wait, each substituent is on a different ring. So each ring has a methyl ester and a nitro group attached at position 2. Wait, each ring has two substituents? No, each ring has a methyl ester and a nitro group? Or is it each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6 positions?

Wait, actually, the compound is dimethyl, so the ester groups are on each phenyl ring at position 2, and each ring also has a nitro group at position 6. So each ring has a nitro group and an ester group.

But the biphenyl structure could have a plane of symmetry. If the groups are symmetrical, maybe there's no chiral center. Wait, but each ring has a nitro and an ester. Let me think. Are there any chiral centers in this structure? Each ring has two substituents attached to it, but those substituents are on the same carbon (like position 2 and 6 on each ring? Or each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6, but that's for each ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, making each ring have two substituents. But does that create
