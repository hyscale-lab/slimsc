Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta states. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The incident electrons are 50 MeV, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D with some values in fm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The general form is something like f(θ,φ) = Σ (something involving the spherical harmonics, and the phase shifts). Oh wait, more precisely, I think it's f(ℓ,m) = (1/(2ik)) * (e^{2iδ_ℓ} - 1) * ... something with spherical harmonics.

But wait, the question specifically asks about the direction along the incident beam. Oh right, that's when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees. So we're looking at the forward direction.

In the Born approximation, or in partial wave analysis, the total scattering amplitude is a sum over angular momentum states. For each l, the amplitude contributes a term with associated Legendre polynomials or spherical harmonics. But when θ is 0, things might simplify.

Wait, I think for each partial wave l, the amplitude f_l is (1/(2ik)) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) times something. Then the total amplitude is the sum over l of these terms multiplied by the spherical harmonics evaluated at the scattering angle. But when θ is 0, the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} might simplify. Let me recall: Y_{l,m}(θ=0, φ) is zero except for m=0, and even then maybe not.

Wait, the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} for θ=0. Let me think. The associated Legendre polynomial P_l^m(0) is zero unless l = m, I think. Or maybe for m=0, it's real. Hmm, maybe I should think about specific values. For l=0, m=0: Y_0^0(0, φ) is sqrt(1/(4π)), I think. For l=1, m=0: Y_1^0(0) is -sqrt(3/(8π)) ), or something like that. Wait, maybe I should look for the form of the scattering amplitude at θ=0.

Alternatively, since the scattering is elastic, and we're dealing with phase shifts, perhaps the total scattering amplitude f(θ=0) is given by summing contributions from each l, each multiplied by their respective factors.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. Oh, right! The optical theorem says that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0,0)).

Wait, that's a key point. So if I can compute Im(f) at θ=0, I can relate it to the total cross-section. But wait, I don't have the total cross-section given. Hmm, but maybe I can express Im(f) directly using the phase shifts.

Wait, let me think again. The scattering amplitude f in partial wave expansion is:

f(θ,φ) = Σ_{l=0}^∞ Σ_{m=-l}^l [ (2l+1) (i^{2l} ) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ( (2l+1)/(4π) )^{1/2} P_l^m(cosθ) e^{i m φ} ) ]

Wait, maybe I'm getting the exact expression wrong. Alternatively, another formula I remember is:

f(θ, φ) = Σ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ) * (4π/(2l+1))^{1/2} ( (-i)^l ) * Y_{l,0}(θ, φ)

Wait, because when m=0, the azimuthal dependence is e^{i m φ} = 1, so for forward scattering, φ isn't really relevant because the beam is along a specific direction, say z-axis. So maybe the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ=0) is the sum over l of the terms involving Y_{l,0}(0).

Wait, Y_{l,0}(0,φ) is a function that depends on l. So for each l, we have Y_{l,0}(0) multiplied by (e^{2iδ_l} -1) / (2ik), times some normalization factors.

But wait, maybe I can find the imaginary part of f(0) as the sum over l of the imaginary parts of each term. So each term is [(e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik)] * Y_{l,0}(0). And then take the imaginary part of each of
