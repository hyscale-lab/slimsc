Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, Grubbs is a catalyst for olefin metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds, swapping the ends. So, the starting material is racemic, meaning it's a 50-50 mix of the two enantiomers.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So, CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent is five carbons. So for pent-1-ene, it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Oh wait, but wait, 3-methyl, so a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 1: CH₂-, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), and then carbon 4 and 5. Wait, maybe. Let me structure it:

Structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene: the formula would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Let me count: Carbon 1: CH₂-, Carbon 2: CH-, Carbon 3:
