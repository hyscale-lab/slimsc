Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible outer layer of a star, and when they say the iron atoms are in a specific energy level, that probably relates to their excitation states. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, but wait, I should clarify what exactly is being compared here. Oh right, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

The question is about the effective temperatures of the stars, T1 and T2. The options are four different equations involving ln(2), T1, and T2. So I need to figure out the correct relation between their temperatures based on the excitation levels of the iron atoms.

Wait, since the stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels should follow the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states to temperature. The equation is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So, if the energy levels have a certain energy difference ΔE, the ratio of the populations (N_upper / N_lower) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But wait, sometimes it's written as exp(-ΔE/(k T)) or maybe the reciprocal if it's lower over upper. I need to get that right.

In the question, star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms as star_2. Wait, does "twice as excited" mean more atoms are in the higher energy level? Because when something is more excited, it's in a higher energy state. So maybe in star_1, the population of the higher energy level is twice that of star_2's for the same level. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the excited state to the ground state, so star_1 has a higher ratio.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level". So I think that the number of iron atoms in a certain excited energy level (say, the upper level) compared to another (lower) level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Or perhaps it's the number in the upper level relative to the lower that's twice as high in star_1.

Let me rephrase: N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the population in the excited level for star_1, and N2 is for star_2. Or maybe it's (N_upper / N_lower)_1 = 2 * (N_upper / N_lower)_2.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, but excitation typically refers to the population in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. So if the excitation is higher, more atoms are in the upper state. So, star_1 has a higher ratio of upper to lower.

So according to the Boltzmann equation:

(N_upper / N_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Assuming g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), the ratio depends on temperature.

So for star_1, the ratio is R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star_2, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Given that in star_1, atoms are twice as excited as in star_2 for this specific energy level, so R1 = 2 * R2. Or, perhaps, the ratio R1 is twice R2, so R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, the problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if the excitation level is higher, the ratio of upper to lower is higher. So R1 = 2 * R2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

Let me plug in the expressions:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking natural logs of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2).

Which is:

(ΔE / k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So:

(ΔE)/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, looking at the options, which equation resembles this?

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, in our equation, we have that (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) equals ln(2). So the equation would be ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

But the options don't have the ΔE term. So perhaps this suggests that the options are simplifying under some assumptions, like maybe ΔE/(k) is 1? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, and Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! Because k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is approximately equal to k. So ΔE ≈ k. Therefore, ΔE/(k) is approximately 1.

So substituting ΔE ≈ k, then (ΔE)/(k) =1.

So the equation becomes:

1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So that's:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

So that's exactly what we have here. So the correct equation is option D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, and the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

In LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the degeneracies of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in the specific energy level compared to star_2, the ratio of the populations of the upper to lower energy levels for star_1 is twice that of star_2:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for the ratios:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), it follows that \(\Delta E / k \approx 1\). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
