Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the transgenic mouse model isn't overexpressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let me break down the problem step by step.

The scenario is that someone is creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They modified the GADD45G gene by adding a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but the protein isn't being overexpressed. They checked the plus strand sequence and found an issue.

Looking at the options, what could be wrong? Let me think about each possibility.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So a mutation changed an amino acid in the HA tag. That could affect its recognition by antibodies used for affinity purification, but would that prevent the protein from being expressed? Maybe, but if the HA tag isn't functional, the purification might fail, but the construct might still be expressed. However, the problem says the protein isn't overexpressed, so maybe this is possible. But I'm not sure if a missense mutation here would cause low expression or just inability to purify.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. Translation termination happens when a stop codon is encountered. If there's an early stop codon, the protein would be truncated. But in the provided sequence, I need to look for any in-frame stop codons. The reading frame starts with ATG (the first codon is ATG, which is methionine). Let's scan through the sequence.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me go through the sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TT... etc. Let's look for any of the stop codons. Hmm, looking through:

Wait, let me read the entire sequence. Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand, which is the coding (non-template) strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this. So when looking for stop codons in the mRNA, we need to consider the mRNA sequence, which is the reverse complement of the DNA's coding strand.

Wait, wait. Wait, the DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA is the same as the DNA except T becomes U. So any TAA in the DNA would be UAA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking through the DNA sequence for TAA or TAG or TGA. Let me scan:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in triplets.

Let me go step by step.

First, the start is ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), ATA (isoleucine), CGA (arginine), etc. Hmm.

Looking for TAA: Let's see. Let's look for any T followed by A followed by A. Or any T followed by G and A (TGA), or T followed by A followed by G (TAG).

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TAA: Let's see. The sequence is long. Let me look for sections where TAA occurs.

Wait, the DNA sequence is given. So the mRNA will have UAA, etc. So in DNA, any TAA would correspond to UAA in the mRNA, a stop codon.

Looking for TAA in the DNA:

Looking for 'T A A' as a triplet. Let me see.

- Starting from the beginning:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TT...

Wait, between the first codons: ATG, TAC, CCC, ATA (which is T-A-T; wait no, in DNA, it's T-A-T as the third codon? Wait, the first codon is ATG (DNA: A-T-G), mRNA is AUG. The second codon is TAC (T-A-C), mRNA is UA C (but wait, mRNA is complementary, so for DNA TAC, mRNA is AUG?), wait, no. Wait, no, the DNA strand is the coding (sense) strand, so mRNA is same as DNA, except T becomes U. So DNA TAC becomes mRNA UAC, which is tyrosine.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of a stop codon in the DNA coding sequence that would be present in the mRNA.

Looking through the DNA sequence, looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking for TGA: Let's see.

Looking for T G A in the DNA. Let me scan:

Looking through the sequence...

Looking at the end, the sequence ends with ...CAGTGA3'. Wait, the last part is CAG TGA. So in DNA, CAG is GCT in mRNA (no, wait, DNA is CAG, mRNA is GUC? No, wait, the DNA coding strand is 5' to 3'. The mRNA is made as a complementary strand, so it's 5' to 3' as well, so each DNA base is replaced by its complement. Wait, perhaps I should write it out.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA is the same as the DNA, but T to U substitution. So any TAA in the DNA will be UAA in mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking for 'TAA' in the DNA sequence:

Looking for triplets like TAA. Scanning:

The end of the DNA sequence is ...CAGTGA3'

So the last few bases: CAG TGA.

Wait, the last codon would be TGA, which in DNA is TGA. So in mRNA, it becomes UGA, which is a stop codon. So the DNA has a TGA codon at the end. So the construct ends with TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but is that in the correct frame? Because the reading frame starts with ATG.

So let's check the reading frame.

The DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TT... (and so on) ... CAG TGA 3'

So each codon is in triplets.

The first codon is ATG
