Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow since I'm still learning.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when a dibromide reacts with a strong base like KOH, it's probably an elimination reaction. So maybe it forms an alkene because elimination usually does that. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons in adamantane, eliminating H2O and Br- would form a double bond. Wait, but adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so the position of the double bond would be between the two carbons that were brominated. So the product after KOH would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide? Oh wait, no, elimination with KOH would more likely form an alkene, not an epoxide. Wait, but under certain conditions, maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product after KOH is probably an epoxide because epoxides have a C-O-C structure and the carbonyl-like peak. Wait, but wait, KOH is a base, but it's possible that it's an elimination to form an alkene, and then maybe a diene. But I'm getting confused because IR of 1720 is more like a ketone or ester or maybe an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: if the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene. But then the IR would show a peak for the double bond, around 1640 cm-1 maybe. But here it's 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution unless the molecule is set up for substitution. Hmm.

Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination, but that would form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by OH. So each Br would be substituted by OH, leading to a diol. But a diol would have OH groups, which would show broad peaks in IR, maybe around 3300. But the IR here is 1720, so that's not matching.

Wait another thought: Maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of the adamantane. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. But then, how does that lead to a carbonyl in IR? Maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, could it be that the KOH is causing an oxidation? No, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial product. Let's think again. The product after KOH is 1, and its 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm as a 2H triplet. That region (around 4.7) is typical for an oxygenated CH2 group, maybe an epoxide. Because in epoxides, the protons are deshielded and usually show up around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in more complex structures they could be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or an alcohol. But the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons.

Wait, the 1H NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in the 2-2.4 ppm range probably belong to the adamantane structure. Because adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid, and the protons are typically around 1-2 ppm, but maybe in this case, some are deshielded a bit more. The 1.94 (2H) could be another set near the functional group.

But the IR's 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is an epoxide, but why the IR? Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. But how would that form from KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol with some oxidation, but I don't see how KOH would oxidize it.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. So if both Br atoms are replaced by something else. Wait, KOH would provide OH- as a nucleophile, but under what conditions? If it's a SN2 reaction, but adamantane is a bulky structure, so SN2 is unlikely. So maybe it's a double substitution, each Br is replaced by OH, giving a diol. But then the IR peak would be for OH groups, which are around 3300. But the product's IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. If product 1 is an epoxide, then the IR would have a peak around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O stretching in the epoxide. But the given IR is 1720, which is higher. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Oh wait, perhaps via elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't directly give a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a substitution or elimination but something else. Maybe it's a ring-opening via a base, leading to a more complex structure. Hmm, but I'm stuck.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests that these protons are adjacent to another two protons. Maybe it's an -OCH2CH2O- structure, but that's a possibility for an epoxide. But in an epoxide, the protons are usually a singlet or a triplet if near another set. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetate group. Wait, but why would KOH produce an acetate? Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could indicate an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then the structure would have a carbonyl group. But how does that form from dibromide and KOH? Maybe via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Heated to 240Â°C with excess KOH. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? Hofmann elimination is for amines, but in this case, the starting material is a dibromide. Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation to form a diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl in IR.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form an epoxide. How? Maybe via a neighboring group mechanism. Wait, but I thought epoxides are typically formed from vicinal dihalides using a base like NaOH in an SN2 mechanism. Oh wait! Vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) can react with a base to form epoxides. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a vicinal dihalide (if the two Br are on adjacent carbons), perhaps reacts with KOH to form an epoxide.

Wait, the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So the two Br atoms are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane. Are 1 and 3 adjacent? Let me think about adamantane's structure. Adamantane has a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused. So positions 1 and 3: are they adjacent? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact structure of adamantane, but in any case, if the dihalide is vicinal (adjacent), then it can form an epoxide upon treatment with a base. But if the two Br are not on adjacent carbons, then it can't form an epoxide. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Br on carbons that are not adjacent. Because in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, but the positions 1 and 3 are probably not adjacent. So maybe it's not a vicinal dihalide, so epoxide formation isn't possible.

Hmm, so maybe that's not the case. So back to the drawing board.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. The IR would then show peaks for the double bonds, which are around 1650 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720, which is a higher wavenumber. Not matching. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, could the reaction form a ketone via some kind of oxidation? But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's some kind of elimination
