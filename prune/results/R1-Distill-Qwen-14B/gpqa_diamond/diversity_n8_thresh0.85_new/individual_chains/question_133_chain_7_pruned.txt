Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with this stuff. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 mL of volume and contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, and we have the Ka values for H3PO4. 

Hmm, I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, this looks like a buffer solution. Buffer solutions are typically made of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which makes sense here because H3PO4 is a weak acid. 

Wait, let me think about what each of these salts dissociates into. KH2PO4, when dissolved in water, should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The Na2HPO4·2H2O, when it dissolves, should break down into Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, right? So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Orthophosphate ions are HPO4^2-, I think. So the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. Its three dissociation steps are:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes me think of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation because it's a buffer. The Henderson equation relates pH to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid.

Wait, but which pKa should I use here? Since the solution involves H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant step is the second dissociation. So the pKa would be pKa2, which is the logarithm of 6.2e-8. Let
