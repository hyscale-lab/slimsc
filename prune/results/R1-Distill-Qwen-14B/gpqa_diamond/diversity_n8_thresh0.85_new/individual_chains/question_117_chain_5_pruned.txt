Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism where the compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So, they have different physical properties like melting points, boiling points, and importantly, they can rotate plane-polarized light. These are also called enantiomers.

The question gives four compounds and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different combinations.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Oh, biphenyl compounds can have different isomerism. Wait, biphenyls can have either conrotatory or disrotatory ring flipping, but that's about their rotation. For optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the structure is 6,6'-dinitro linked to the biphenyl, and 2,2'-dicarboxylate as dimethyl esters. Are there any chiral centers here? Well, the biphenyl's substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Let me visualize: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester (from the dicarboxylate) at 2. Wait, the positions might be such that each ring has substituents at 2, 6. But wait, if the two rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions, then each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If both rings are identical in substitution, perhaps it's symmetrical. Let's think: the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are symmetric across the mirror plane between the two rings. So, the molecule might not be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then it could have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl structure itself isn't leading to chirality, but the substituents might create a chiral center elsewhere. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the central part is the biphenyl linked through 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So the substituents on each phenyl ring are at 2 and 6. Since each ring has two substituents, it's possible that the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make each ring itself asymmetric, that could contribute. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, if the two rings are mirror images of each other, then the entire molecule might be symmetrical. So maybe compound 1 is not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. The structure is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH. Wait, the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO-, so as the methyl ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the methyl ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon is the one attached to the OH, CH3, COOCH3 groups. So the structure is: 

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

The central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:
- CH3
