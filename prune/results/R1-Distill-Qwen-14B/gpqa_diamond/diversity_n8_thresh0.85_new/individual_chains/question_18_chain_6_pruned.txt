Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the question isn't about their masses directly; it's about their elemental abundances. The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the notation [X/Y] in astronomy represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y relative to the Sun. The formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So each of these values tells us how the elements compare in the stars versus the Sun.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, let me parse that. Oh, wait, no: the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So I can rearrange that to find log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, it's 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7, so log10(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH_sun is 10^(-5).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. The notation is 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) for the Sun. So for Fe, it's 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, it's 7, so log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7-12=-5. So nMg/nH_sun = 1e-5.

Now, for the stars. Let's take Star_1 first.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) for Star_1 divided by that for the Sun. So [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH)_star1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that log10(nFe/nH)_star1 = same as the Sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun. So for Star_1, nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Wait, but wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 1e-4.5. So Star_1's nFe/nH is the same as the Sun's, because [Fe/H] is 0. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is 1e-4.5.

Similarly, what about [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3? That means [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe)_star1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, let's compute nSi/nFe for Star_1.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 = log10( (nSi/nFe)_star1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun )

So (nSi/nFe)_star1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but what's (nSi/nFe)_sun? Well, for the Sun, nSi is another variable. Let me think. Wait, perhaps I can
