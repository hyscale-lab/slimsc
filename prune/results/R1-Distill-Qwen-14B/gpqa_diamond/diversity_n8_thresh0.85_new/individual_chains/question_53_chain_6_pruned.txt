Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The question is about determining the molecular formula of an unknown compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which suggests it's something like benzene with two substituents.

The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) which typically absorbs around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So, the structure must have an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum details:

- Six signals in total.
- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent can cause different splitting. The two aromatic signals could be due to two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para substitution, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons each, but wait, para would have one set, not two. Wait, wait, di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. Let me think. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two equivalent sets of two protons each. So, two signals for aromatic-H. Alternatively, if it's meta, maybe it's more complex, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the substituents are such that the aromatic ring has two different types of protons, each split into two signals.

- Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually found in doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons. A doublet of quartets suggests that the proton is coupled with two different sets of protons. Hmm, maybe this is part of an ester group. Like, perhaps an allylic group or a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R. So, perhaps the structure has an ester substituent. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR says two vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets. So, if one is a doublet and another a doublet of quartets, maybe the substituent on the ring is an ester with a double bond adjacent. For example, maybe something like a methyl vinyl ester, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acrylate group, like CH₂=CHCOO-R, but that's getting more complicated.

Wait, looking back: the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. So, perhaps two different sets of vinyl protons. For example, in a structure like CH₂=CH-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent isn't directly on the ring but connected via a chain.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. One of them could be an ester group, which would account for the IR peak. The other substituent could be something else.

Now, looking at the NMR signals for the –CH3 groups: two signals. So, perhaps two different methyl groups. Since there are two signals, they must be in different environments. So, maybe one methyl is adjacent to an electronegative group like oxygen (like in an ester), and another methyl is somewhere else.

But wait, the problem says two signals for –CH3 groups, and no signals for –CH2 groups. So, the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups (-CH₂-). So any CH₂ must be absent.

So, putting this together, let's think about possible structures.

The di-substituted benzene has two groups. Let me think about an ester as one substituent. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, maybe O-CO-O-R or something. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but that would be a carbonate. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyl group (like OAc), but that doesn't have vinyl-H.

Wait, wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, maybe something like O-CO-CH₂CH₂-O-... No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester, like CH₂=CHCOO-. That way, the substituent would have vinyl protons.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH₂CH₂-O-R? No, maybe substituent is like CH₂=CHCOOR. For example, if it's an allyl ester, like –O–CO–CH₂CH₂CH₂–, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a methyl group. But in that case, the NMR would show a singlet for the methyl group, unless it's adjacent to something else.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for –CH3. So, two different methyl groups. Let's think about possible structures where the benzene ring
