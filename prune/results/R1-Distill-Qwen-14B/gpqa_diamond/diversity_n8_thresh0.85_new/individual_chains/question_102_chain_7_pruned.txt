Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about a ligand-receptor pair and their expression in a mouse model. Hmm, let me read through the question again.

So the setup is that they identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that form a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein from the same mRNA.

Between the ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. That means that without Cre, the mCherry won't be expressed because the stop cassette is in the way. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP are separated by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So the eGFP won't be expressed unless the stop is excised.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in a Western blot. The blot uses total proteins with actin as a loading control. So they probably checked whether the ligand and receptor are being expressed.

Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the SOX10 promoter, meaning it's active in neural crest cells and their derivatives.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see green fluorescence because the eGFP should be expressed if the construct is working. But they don't see any green signal. The question is why.

Let's look at the options.

Option A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I don't see how that relates to the expression in the mouse model. The construct is about expressing both proteins, so whether they're paracrine or autocrine might affect function, but not necessarily the expression in the Western or the fluorescence.

Option B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is a reporter for proper protein trafficking. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be on the cell surface, so maybe wouldn't fluoresce. But wait, the problem says they don't see any green signal. If it's stuck, perhaps the construct isn't even made. But I thought the Cre would excise the stops, so maybe not.

Option C) enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is part of the same bicistronic transcript. So if the enhancer is missing, maybe they're not expressed. But the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So the plasmid's promoters would be active. If the CBA promoter isn't working, the ligand wouldn't be expressed, but I don't know if that ties into the mouse model. Wait, the mouse model is using the Cre to excise the stops in the construct, so if the promoter isn't working, the proteins wouldn't be expressed. But the question says they used the same construct in primary astrocytes, which showed the expression, I assume. Because they made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins.

Wait, no, the question says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture to test expression on Western blot. So the expression should be from the plasmid. The plasmid's ligand is under CBA, which should drive expression regardless of the cell's enhancers. So if the Western blot worked, the construct must be expressing the proteins when transfected. So in the mouse model, the expression is under endogenous regulatory elements. Wait, no. The construct is probably inserted into the genome, but whether the promoters are active depends on the mouse's regulatory regions.

Wait, the construct is a bicistronic vector with CBA promoter driving ligand, and IRES driving receptor. So in the mouse, the CBA promoter should drive ligand expression, and the IRES allows for receptor expression. But if the enhancers are missing, maybe the promoters aren't active. But if the plasmid works in transfected astrocytes, then the promoters are functional. So maybe the mouse construct is missing something else.

Option D) receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. The eGFP is fused to the receptor at the C-terminus. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. Wait, the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So without Cre, the stop is present, so the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. When Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the eGFP to be expressed downstream. So in the mouse model, if the construct is correctly excised, the receptor should be expressed with eGFP. But if the frame is wrong, maybe the eGFP isn't correctly expressed.

Wait, but the question says that they didn't see any green signal. So where could that
