Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in these problems, the notation [X/Y] means log base 10 of (X/Y ratio divided by the solar ratio of X/Y). Oh wait, right, it's the logarithm of the ratio of element abundances relative to the Sun.

So the stars are Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I don't think the mass directly affects the abundance ratio—maybe just the problem setup? Let me check the given data.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3. So Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.
Wait, wait, no. Because [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y) / (X/Y)_sun ). So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So (Si/Fe)_1 = 2 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

And [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H) = 0 → Fe/H = 1. So Fe in Star_1 is the same as solar Fe.

What's the solar Fe abundance? The problem gives for the Sun: nFe/nH is 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5). Wait, wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(7-12) = 10^-5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning Fe/H = 1. So Fe in Star_1 is same as Sun. So Fe abundance is (Fe/H)_1 = 1. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0.

But wait, [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H), so if it's 0, then Fe/H is 1. So Star_1's Fe is same as Sun's.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

What's (Si/Fe)_sun? It's nSi/nH / (nFe/nH) for the Sun. Wait, wait, no: nSi/Fe is nSi/nFe. Because (nSi/nH)/(nFe/nH) = nSi/nFe. So (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH) = log(nSi/nH) - log(nFe/nH) → but wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log(nX/nH) = value, so nX/nH = 1
