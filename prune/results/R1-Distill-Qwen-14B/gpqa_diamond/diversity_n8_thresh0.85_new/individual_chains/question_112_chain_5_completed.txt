Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, the question then asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So, let me think about what this operator looks like.

In a two-level system (like spin-½), the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenvectors of the matrix. Oh wait, the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Because for i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero. So this matrix is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. That looks familiar; it's similar to the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, this operator must be (ħ/2) times sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of this operator would be ±ħ/2.

But wait, our state |alpha> is in the z-basis. So to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of the new operator, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, the operator given.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to diagonalize the operator A and find its eigenstates, then calculate the overlap with |alpha>.

Alternatively, another approach: since A is proportional to sigma_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), or something like that. Wait, let me get the exact expressions right.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1. So yes, our operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, so the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x, just scaled by ħ/2 and with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait no, eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the eigenvalues of sigma_x, which are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A are ± ħ/2.

So, the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis. To find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and find the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: since the operator A has a matrix representation, maybe we can find its eigenstates and then compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

But let's first normalize |alpha> because it's given as proportional.

So |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Let me compute the norm squared: |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. The cross terms would be (1+i)(2+i)*. Wait, no, actually, since |a + b|^2 = a a* + b b* + a b* + a* b. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + a b* + a* b.

But in this case, a is (1+i)|up> and b is (2-i)|down>. Since |up> and |down> are orthogonal, the cross terms would be zero when taking the inner product. Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is zero. So the norm squared of |alpha> is |(1+i)|^2 + |(2-i)|^2.

So |1 + i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator A has the matrix:

A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So, to find the eigenstates of A, we need to solve for the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Let's find the eigenvectors.

For eigenvalue + ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ],
 [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ] 

So the equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0
(ħ/2) v1 - (ħ/2) v2 =0

Which simplifies to v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is (1, 1) up to a scalar. But we can normalize it. So |+> eigenstate is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0:

[[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ],
 [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] ]

Equations: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2=0 → v1 = -v2. So eigenvector is (1, -1)/sqrt(2) → |-> eigenstate is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of operator A are |x+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |x-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, our state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis. We can rewrite it in terms of the x-basis.

So, let's compute the components of |alpha> in the x+ and x- directions.

|alpha> = c_x+ |x+> + c_x- |x->.

We can find c_x+ as <x+ | alpha>, and c_x- as <x- | alpha>.

So, let's compute <x+ | alpha>.

<x+| alpha> = [ (1, 1)/sqrt(2) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Wait, the inner product is:

( (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ) * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> )

Which equals (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ) )

But since <up|down> =0, and <up|up>=1, <down|down>=1:

So,

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 0 + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 0 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

Simplify:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Wait, 1+i +2 -i =3. Because i and -i cancel, 1+2=3.

So,

(1/sqrt(2)) * (3 / sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, <x- | alpha> is:

[ (1, -1)/sqrt(2) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ]

Wait, let me compute this:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) )

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i -2 +i) ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(7)

So, the coefficient is ( -1 + 2i ) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients.

Compute |c_x+|² = (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Compute |c_x-|² = | (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |².

The numerator: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So |c_x-|²=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. And 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.357, so 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, the probabilities add up to 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571. So 0.64 and 0.36 approximately.

Now the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> is in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute <sigma_x> first, then multiply by ħ/2.

Because A = (ħ/2) sigma_x.

So <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

But sigma_x in the z-basis is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value <sigma_x> is given by:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>,

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * sigma_x matrix * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we multiply sigma_x by the vector [a; b], we get [b; a].

So the product sigma_x |alpha> is |down> * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + |up> * (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

(1)(2) =2, 1*(-i) = -i, (-i)(2)= -2i, (-i)(-i)=i²= -1.

So 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i) )=1 -3i.

Wait, wait, let me compute (1 -i)(2 -i):

=1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
=2 -i -2i + (i²)
=2 -3i -1 (since i²= -1)
= (2-1) -3i
=1 -3i.

So first term is (1-3i)/7.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

=2*1 +2*i + i*1 +i*i
=2 +2i +i +i²
=2 +3i -1 (since i²=-1)
= (2-1) +3i
=1 + 3i.

So second term is (1+3i)/7.

Adding both terms: (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <sigma_x> is 2/7.

Then, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Wait that's interesting. So the average value of A is ħ/7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says average is ħ/7. Option D says 2ħ/sqrt(7), but that's about 0.755 ħ. Hmm.

So the probabilities we found are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7 → this matches.

Option A's first two numbers are 0.64 and 0.36, which are our probabilities. The average is ħ/7, which matches.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I compute the expectation value correctly?

Hmm, when I calculated <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>, I got 2/7. Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the state is a linear combination a|up> + b|down>.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the expectation value using the components.

The state |alpha> is a|up> + b|down>, with a=(1+i)/sqrt(7) and b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then, <sigma_x> = [a* b + b* a ].

Because sigma_x in the z-basis has elements [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>,

it becomes a* b* (sigma_x_{up,down}) + b* a* (sigma_x_{down,up} ), but sigma_x has 1's off-diagonal, so:

= a* b + b* a.

So, a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7 = (2 -i -2i +i²)/7 = (2 -3i -1)/7 = (1 -3i)/7.

Compute b* a = (2 + i)(1 + i) /7 = (2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i*i)/7 → 2 +3i -1 → (1 +3i)/7.

Now, a* b + b* a = [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] /7 = 2/7.

So yes, that's correct. So <sigma_x> is 2/7, so <A> = (ħ/2)(2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is "0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7".

So that should be the correct option.


The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm squared:
\[
\|α\|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, σ_x, with eigenvalues ±1. The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are:
\[
|x_+⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |x_-⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the x-basis
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in |x_+⟩ and |x_-⟩, compute the overlap of |α⟩ with these eigenstates:
\[
⟨x_+|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
⟨x_-|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(x_+) = \left|⟨x_+|α⟩\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(x_-) = \left|⟨x_-|α⟩\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is given by:
\[
⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩.
\]
Since A = (ħ/2)σ_x, this becomes:
\[
⟨A⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{2}⟨α|σ_x|α⟩.
\]
The expectation value ⟨α|σ_x|α⟩ is computed as:
\[
⟨σ_x⟩ = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} + \frac{(2+i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
⟨A⟩ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is ħ/7. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
