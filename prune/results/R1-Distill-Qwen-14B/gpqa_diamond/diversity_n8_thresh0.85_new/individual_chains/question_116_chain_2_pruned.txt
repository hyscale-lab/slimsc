Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's break down what's given and what I need to find out.

First, the question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet suggests each is next to three. 

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So 6H as a triplet; that could be something like two equivalent CH2 groups next to a CH3, because each CH2 would see the two protons from the CH3. Wait, no, wait. The triplet in NMR for a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3 would be a quartet, because each H in CH2 is next to 3 H's (from CH3). Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, the splitting is based on neighboring protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (which is like a CH3 group) probably is attached to a CH2. Because a triplet would mean each H in the CH3 is next to two Hs in another group. So, for example, a CH3 connected to a CH2, where each H in the CH2 is next to two Hs in the CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the CH3 would be split by the CH2. So the CH2's Hs would be a quartet (if each is next to three Hs, but wait, that's a quartet). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, the triplet is for 6H. So maybe it's two CH3 groups. Because each CH3 has 3 Hs, and two would make 6. So two CH3 groups, each next to a CH2. So each of those CH3 would be a triplet because they're adjacent to a CH2 (which has 2 Hs, but wait, each H in the CH3 is next to 2 Hs, so the splitting would be a triplet? Hmm, no, wait. The CH3 group attached to a CH2 would have their Hs split into a quartet, because each H in CH3 is next to 2 Hs in the CH2. Wait, no
