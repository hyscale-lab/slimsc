Okay, I need to figure out the structure of the compound based on the given NMR data and then determine the product after the reaction with the reagents provided. Let me start by analyzing the NMR data step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, wait, I think the formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. X is 0 since no halogens are mentioned. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring plus double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might suggest coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, or maybe it's something else like an acidic proton. But 9.7 is very close to aldehyde, so let me think.

Other signals: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d,2H). These look like two sets of doublets, which could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two protons each on two ortho positions. Wait, wait, no. Oh wait, maybe two aromatic rings each with substituents? Alternatively, perhaps a single para-disubstituted benzene, but the integration is 2H each. Hmm.

Another peak: 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. Could be an enol proton or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents that cause coupling, but the broadness suggests maybe exchange, like an -OH proton? But the integration is 2H, so maybe two -OH groups? Or perhaps a conjugated diene system where the protons are deshielded.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm: a doublet integrating 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Like an ether or an ester. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring set, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The aldehyde at 9.72 suggests a carbonyl group. The OCH2 group (3.66 ppm) could be part of an ester or ether. The aromatic signals: perhaps there are two aromatic rings attached to the main chain.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's try to build the structure. So, if it's an aldehyde, that would be RCHO. Then, perhaps some substituents.

Looking at the NMR:

- The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) might be the aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have adjacent protons. Hmm, wait a second. Oh, wait, maybe it's an alpha proton to the aldehyde? Like in a conjugated system. For example, in an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde), the proton adjacent to the aldehyde (the beta position) would be deshielded and might be a triplet if it's coupling with two protons (like in a CH2 group). But wait, in an enal, the structure would be RCH2CH2CHO? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a cyclic structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triplet is not the aldehyde proton. What else is around 9.72? An acidic proton like an -NH? But that would be a broad peak, perhaps. Or maybe an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe it's an amide? But the NMR doesn't show amide protons typically in that area. Or maybe it's an enamine?

Wait, another approach: Let's look for the OCH2 group. 3.66 ppm, 2H, doublet. That suggests maybe a -OCH2CH2- group, but coupled with another group. Or perhaps a -OCH2- attached to something else.

Looking back at the aromatic signals: 6.98 (d,2H) and 6.51 (d,2H). These are likely two sets of doublets, each integrating 2H. This suggests two para-substituted groups on an aromatic ring. For example, two substituents in para positions, each with a pair of protons. Alternatively, perhaps two separate aromatic rings, each with two protons as doublets.

Wait, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a bit tricky. Broad singlet, 2H. Could this be an O-H group? But two -OH protons might be exchanging and appear as a broad signal. But if it's -
