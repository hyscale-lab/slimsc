Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I guess that means the conditions there follow the usual laws of thermodynamics, like the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system to temperature. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of the populations of two states is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights and ΔE is the energy difference.

In this problem, the energy levels are the same for both stars because it's the same energy difference for both. Oh wait, no, wait. The energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same for both stars because they're comparing the same energy levels across the two stars.

So, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Let me think what that means. Oh, it's about the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one. Wait, or is it just the excitation in general? I think it's about the population ratio. Like, the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited." So maybe it's the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to some other state. Let's say the ratio N_upper/N_lower is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

So, for star_1, let's say N1_upper / N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper / N2_lower). Or wait, no, the problem says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Hmm, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state, and star_1's ratio is twice as much as star_2's.

Wait, I think the key is the ratio of populations. For each star, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Since both stars are talking about the same transition (same ΔE), but possibly different temperatures.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that the energy difference is the same (ΔE = 1.38e-23 J) for both stars. So, for star_1 and star_2, their ratios would be N1/Nlower = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) and N2_upper/N2_lower = same expression with T2.

Wait, but the problem says that N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice as much as that of star_2. Because star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited. So, N1/N2 = 2.

So, (N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower)

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Wait, maybe the specific energy level is the same for both, so the population in that level is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. Or maybe the excitation in terms of the energy—no, I think it's about the population ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation temperature is being considered. Oh wait, in LTE, the excitation is governed by the thermal energy, so higher temperature would lead to higher population in higher energy levels.

But perhaps the ratio of the populations (N1/N2) is 2.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So, applying Boltzmann's equation, for each star:

N_upper / N_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars because they're the same element, same transition. So g_upper / g_lower is the same for both stars.

Let me denote this ratio as R. So R = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) )

For star_1: R1 = (g/g') * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
For star_2: R2 = (g/g') * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Given that R1 = 2 * R2. Because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Substituting,

(g/g') exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 (g/g') exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The (g/g') terms cancel out. So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which is:

exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] ) = 2

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, rearranging,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

But I think I can rearrange this expression to get a ratio involving T1 and T2.

Let me rearrange the equation:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Let me factor the equation:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But I don't have the exact values for ΔE, k, T1, T2. But perhaps the equation can be
