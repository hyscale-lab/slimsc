Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what I have here. The question involves Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product from the options given. 

First, I'll look at the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Let me jot down the IR peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests an -OH group or maybe an amine (but more likely -OH because amines usually show sharper peaks). The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might correspond to aromatic C=C stretching, which would mean the compound has a benzene ring. 

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a very downfield proton, probably an -OH from a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have broad singlets around 10-12 ppm. But if it's a phenol, the -OH would also be around that region, but sometimes as a broader peak. 

Then there's 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two sets of doublets, probably from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the H's are equivalent and split into doublets. So maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene with substituents at the para positions. 

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be some sort of methylene or methine group adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a CH group next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester. 

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet or doublet, probably a methyl group attached to something else, maybe a CH2 or CH group. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, like a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe there's a butyl group somewhere.

Putting this together, I'm thinking the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents might include a carbonyl group, and some sort of alkyl chain attached. Let me think about the IR data again. The 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone or an ester. If it's a ketone, then maybe the structure is a benzophenone derivative. But wait, the 1720 could also be a carboxylic acid, but that would need a broad peak around 2500-3000 as well, but the IR shows 3400–2500, which could be O-H. But in that case, the NMR at 10.5 could be a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the NMR also has a triplet at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is typical for a methyl adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe the compound is a phenyl ketone with an alkyl side chain. Let me think. Let's try to piece it together.

The NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the substituents are at the para positions. What substituents could that be? Perhaps a carbonyl group and an alkyl group.

Wait, looking at the options might help. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (cumene)
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So options C and A are benzoic acids, while B and D are alkylbenzenes. So if X is a benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might lead to some reaction.

Wait, but X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That setup makes me think of the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heating, but wait, sometimes red phosphorus and HI are used for reductions too. Oh wait, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used for the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. Or wait, maybe it's for the elimination of certain groups.

Wait, another thought: when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone, and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it might lead to a cleavage. Or perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Let me think. Clemmensen is for ketones to reduce to alkanes. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but that uses Al alcoholates.

Wait, I think the reaction of ketones with red phosphorus and HI is a way to cleave carbonyl groups. So for example, if you have a ketone like acetone, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might lead to some elimination or cleavage. Alternatively, I think the reaction can lead to the formation of an alkane if the carbonyl is adjacent to a hydrogen. Wait, no, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So if X is a ketone, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to an alkane, but wait, what about the rest of the structure?

Alternatively, if X is an ester or a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak. Let me think again about the IR. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which could be a ketone, ester, or acid. The 1610 and 1450 are likely aromatic C=C, as I thought. The broad peak between 3400-2500 suggests O-H. So perhaps a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, that's a possible assignment. But in that case, where would the carbonyl be? For a benzoic
