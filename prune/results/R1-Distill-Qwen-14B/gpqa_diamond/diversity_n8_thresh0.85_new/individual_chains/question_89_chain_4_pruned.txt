Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I'll break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction here. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) are treated with a base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me visualize adamantane. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are actually on adjacent carbons in one of the rings. So, 1,3-dibromo would be two Brs on adjacent carbons in the same ring. So when KOH is used, it would likely eliminate two HBr molecules to form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, but wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, elimination from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a double bond between the same carbons that the Brs were on. So the product would be an alkene. So product 1 is probably adamantene, which is the dehydrohalogenated form with a double bond.

So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene or more accurately, 1,3-didehydro-1,3-adamantane, which is an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,3-diamantadiene? Not entirely sure, but the key is that it's an alkene now.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet. That's probably an -OCH2- group? But wait, if KOH is used, maybe it's an epoxide? No, KOH wouldn't form an epoxide, that's more like a peracid. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? But KOH and dihalide usually leads to elimination (alkene) or substitution if possible. Wait, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, forming a double bond. So product 1 would be an adamantadiene.

Wait, but 4.79 ppm is a region where CH2O groups appear, like in ethers or epoxides. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but KOH wouldn't do epoxidation. Oh, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, wait, another possibility. Maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbanion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if it's an elimination, then product 1 is an alkene, so perhaps what's the NMR showing? Let me think: an alkene's protons would typically be around 5 ppm, but maybe in a ring structure or something, but the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Oh, wait, maybe it's an epoxide ring, but that would require an oxide. Alternatively, maybe after elimination, there's a diol formed, but I thought KOH with dihalides leads to elimination, not substitution, unless it's a different reaction condition.

Wait, maybe I need to think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH. Let's consider that KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When vicinal dihalides react with a strong base, they eliminate to form alkenes. So this should be the case here. So product 1 is an alkene. So the structure would have a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions of adamantane. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene.

But then the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet. That doesn't fit an alkene. Alkenes have protons around 4.5-6.5 ppm, but as a singlet for 2H? Maybe in a ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH didn't just eliminate but perhaps did some other reaction. Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But with two bromines, substitution would lead to a diol. Wait, but dihalide substitution under basic conditions usually isn't
