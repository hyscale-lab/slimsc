Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should choose that one. Hmm, let's break down the problem.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orientation of the orbit. Wait, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - e^2))^½, but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term isn't a factor here. So I can ignore that part.

Wait, no, actually, I think the probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on. But since both planets have already been detected via the radial velocity method, that tells us that their orbits are likely not perfectly edge-on, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the chance that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability is (R_planet + something) / (R_star + something), but I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star, and the distance of the planet from the star. Because a closer planet has a smaller orbit, making the alignment more probable for a transit. Or wait, no, it's the other way around. Let me think again.

The transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a(1 - e²))^(1/2)), but wait, since both are circular, e=0.
