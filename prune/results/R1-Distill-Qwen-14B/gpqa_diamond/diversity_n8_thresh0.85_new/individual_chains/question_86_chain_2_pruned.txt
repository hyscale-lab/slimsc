Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the products are enantiomers, which means they are mirror images of each other, differing in their configuration at the chiral center.

The question is asking which starting materials (A and B) would lead to these products when treated with the respective reducing agents. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different configurations for A and B.

Let me think about the reactions involved here. The product is a ketone, and the starting materials are being treated with reducing agents. Wait, but waitâ€”LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Usually, LiBH4 reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, but wait, in this case, the product is a ketone. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, wait! Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Oh, wait! The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ether with a ketone group. So, the product is a ketone, which implies that the starting material must have had a different functional group that can form a ketone upon reduction. Wait, no, because reducing agents typically reduce higher functional groups. Wait, maybe the starting material is a carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to an alcohol, not form a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Oh wait no, because when you reduce an epoxide, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals or something else. Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone derivative that's being transformed into another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds. Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reactions involve the reduction of an ester or a carbonyl group to form an alcohol, which then undergoes some cyclization. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of ketone formation through
