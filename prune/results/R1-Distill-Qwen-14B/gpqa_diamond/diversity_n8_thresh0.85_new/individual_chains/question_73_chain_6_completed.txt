Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit at c. And energy probably involves their relativistic masses.

Wait, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. Oh, right, because they're moving at relativistic speeds, their masses increase due to the gamma factor. So for each astronaut, I'll need to calculate their relativistic mass.

Let me think about the velocities. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. To find the relative speed between them, I can't just subtract the speeds normally. I think the formula for relative velocity in relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, wait! Wait, no, that formula is when you're finding the velocity of one frame from another. Since both are moving in the same direction, say both are moving along the x-axis. So, for astronaut 1, if the astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c, what's the speed of astronaut 2 relative to astronaut 1?

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) ). Let's compute that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1 / 0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. That would match one of the options, maybe option C or D.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. So for each, calculate gamma, then multiply by their mass.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is gamma * m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. His energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That fits. The other option with 0.14c is D, but D's energy is 5 mc², which is way lower. So option C must be correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). For each astronaut:

1. **First astronaut (\(v = 0.6c\), mass \(2m\)):**
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut (\(v = 0.5c\), mass \(3m\)):**
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
