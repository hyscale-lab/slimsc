Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Benzene has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. So numbering starts with the ethoxy as position 1, then the tert-butyl is position 2, and nitro is position 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. Wait, the actual numbering in the target is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So they are all meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent, like 1 is next to 2, which is next to 3. So the substituents are in the ortho, meta arrangement. But wait, maybe I should think of the positions as 1 being ethoxy, 2 being tert-butyl, and 3 being nitro. So each substituent is adjacent to the next. So ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy, adjacent to tert-butyl). Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the substituents are arranged in a way where each is in a specific position relative to each other.

Anyway, the key is to plan the synthesis steps. Let's think about the directing effects of the substituents. Nitro is a strong meta director, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, which is likely a para director but can be ortho for certain reactions.

Since we're starting with benzene, we need to add these substituents in an order that allows each step to proceed with the correct directing effects.

Let me outline the substituents:

1. tert-butyl (alkylation)
2. ethoxy (ethylation)
3. nitro (nitration)

Wait, the target has all three substituents. So the question is, in what order do I add them to benzene?

Because each substituent directs where the next group will go. So the order of addition matters.

Let me think: if I nitrate first, then ethylate, then alkylation. Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So, let's see.

Option 1: Nitration first.

Adding nitro group as the first substituent. Benzene -> nitrobenzene. Then, the next step would be to add ethoxy. Nitro is meta directing, so the ethoxy would go in a position meta to nitro. Then, the third substituent would be tert-butyl, which is ortho or para to ethoxy.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So perhaps the order is ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl.

But wait, ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para), so after ethoxylation, nitration would add nitro in ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy. Then, tert-butyl could be added in the meta position relative to nitro or something else.

Alternatively, another approach: maybe nitro is added last because it's a deactivating group, which complicates further substitutions.

Wait, the target has ethoxy (OEt), which is a strong activating group. So if I add ethoxy early, it would facilitate the next steps, which would be adding nitro and tert-butyl.

But nitro is a meta director. So perhaps the order is ethoxylation first, then nitration, then alkylation.

Let's plan:

1. Benzene -> Ethoxybenzene (using ethyl chloride and AlCl3 as catalyst; Friedel-Crafts alkylation? Wait, but Friedel-Crafts for alkylation is tricky because it's less favored than acylation. Alternatively, maybe using ethoxy group via another method. Wait, ethoxy is an ether. So to add an ethoxy group to benzene, perhaps through a nucleophilic substitution with a good leaving group. Wait, but benzene isn't nucleophilic. Oh wait, more likely, the ethoxylation is done via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's not favored. Alternatively, maybe through a different method, like using an alkyl halide and AlCl3 as a catalyst. But I think Friedel-Crafts alkylation is possible, but it's more common for acylation. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a different method, like using an ethyl group attached via an oxygen, perhaps through a Williamson-type ether synthesis, but that might involve more steps.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first step in all options is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3, which is Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So in option A, the first step is adding tert-butyl to benzene. So perhaps the first substituent is tert-butyl.

Wait, but wait, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So which comes first?

Let me think of the possible order:

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then, ethoxy. Then, nitro.

But tert-butyl is a bulky group, a strong deactivating (since it's an alkyl group, actually activating, but bulky). So after adding tert-butyl, when adding ethoxy, the directing would be determined by the tert-butyl group.

tert-butyl is an activating group? Wait, no. Alkyl groups are activating (since they are electron-donating via sigma bonds), so they are ortho/para directors. So after adding tert-butyl to benzene, the next substitution (ethoxy) would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

But wait, the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So ethoxy and tert-butyl are adjacent (ortho). Hmm. So if I add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy would go ortho, which would be position 2. Then, where would nitro go?

Wait, let me think again.

If benzene has a tert-butyl group (say at position 1), then the next substitution for ethoxy would be either ortho (position 2
