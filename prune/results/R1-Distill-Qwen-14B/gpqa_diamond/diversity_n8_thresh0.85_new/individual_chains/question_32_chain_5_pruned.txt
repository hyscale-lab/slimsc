Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons.

So the nucleus in question is Li-6. First, I need to find the rest mass of this nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the mass of the electrons because for a nucleus, we only consider protons and neutrons. Wait, but wait, the electrons are in the atoms, but since we're dealing with a nucleus, I think the electrons' mass isn't included. So each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c².

Wait, let me get the exact numbers. A proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be (3 * 938.272) + (3 * 939.565). Let me calculate that.

3 * 938.272 is 2814.816 MeV, and 3 * 939.565 is 2818.695 MeV. Adding those together, 2814.816 + 2818.695 equals 5633.511 MeV. Oh wait, that's 5.633511 GeV, since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second—I remember that the mass of a nucleus is actually slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. Oh, right, that's called the mass defect. So the actual rest mass of the nucleus will be less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Hmm, but I don't have the exact binding energy for Li-6. Oh, maybe this is a problem because without knowing the binding energy, I can't get the exact rest mass. But perhaps, for this problem, we're supposed to ignore the binding energy and just sum the individual masses. That's a common approximation in such problems.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the atomic mass instead. The atomic mass of Li-6 is known. I think it's about 6.012 g/mol. Wait, no, that's grams per mole. Let me convert that to atomic mass units.

Wait, the molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.94 g/mol? Wait, no, wait. Let me check: Li has two main isotopes, Li-6 and Li-7. The standard atomic weight is about 6.94 g/mol, but for Li-6 specifically, the atomic mass is approximately 6.012 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, no, 1 atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66e-27 kg, and 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So if the atomic mass of Li-6 is around 6.012 u, then its rest mass energy would be 6.012 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, and 0.012 * 931.5 is about 11.178 MeV. So total around 5600.178 MeV, which is about 5.600178 GeV. Wait, but that's the same order of magnitude as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So maybe in this case, using the sum of protons and neutrons is acceptable as an approximation, or perhaps the question expects us to use the atomic mass.

Wait
