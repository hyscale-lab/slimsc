Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that the mass dimension of coupling constants plays a big role in whether a theory is renormalizable. Let me think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γμ, γν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I should figure out the mass dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me break down the Lagrangian term: κ times ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. So each of these components contributes to the overall dimension.

I know the mass dimension of the Dirac field ψ. Since the Dirac equation is first order, each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3. But wait, the term here is ψ̄ σ F ψ, right? Let me think about each part.

Wait, σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. Each γ matrix has dimension 1. Because in four dimensions, the gamma matrices are dimensionless? Wait, no, the gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is something like (i/2)[γμ, γν]. The commutator of two γ matrices would still have dimension 0, so σ is dimensionless. So the σ part contributes dimension 0.

Now, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field (I think this is an interaction between fermions and a gauge field, like electromagnetism). The field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2. Because the electromagnetic field A has dimension 1 (since Maxwell's Lagrangian is (1/4)F^2, which must have dimension 4 → F has dimension 2 each, so (F^2) is 4, and 1/4 is dimensionless). So F is dimension 2.

Putting it all together:

The term is κ * ψ̄ * σ * ψ * F.

So each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ is 3 dimensions. F is 2. So the product ψ̄ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 = 5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So κ must make up the difference. So the total dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3/2 + 3/2) is 3, plus 2 is 5. So 5 =4 → [κ] must be -1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck: ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, so together they're 3. F is 2. So ψ̄ ψ F is 3 + 2 =5. So the term is κ times 5, and the Lagrangian has dimension 4. So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the coupling constant having a positive mass dimension. Wait, no. Wait, the general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤4. The coupling constants must have mass dimension ≤4 minus the sum of the fields' dimensions. But wait, for a theory to be renormalizable, all the interaction terms must have coupling constants with non-negative mass dimensions, I think. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, you can have higher-order terms that make the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, another approach: the renormalizability is determined by the superficial degree of divergence. For a term in the Lagrangian, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D=4 - (sum of each field's dimension in the term). For the term to be renormalizable, D must be ≥0.

Wait, but the interaction term here is the term itself, so the term has dimension 4 because that's how Lagrangians work. So the superficial degree of divergence for the vertex would be D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term). The fields in the term are ψ, ψ, and F. Let me compute that.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, F has dimension 2. So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3+2=5. So D=4-5= -1. Wait, but D is the superficial degree of divergence for the corresponding Feynman diagram. If D is positive, the diagram is superrenormalizable; if D=0, it's exactly renormalizable; if D negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, I think I might have the formula wrong. The superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in each vertex) × (number of vertices) - (number of loops) × ... Hmm, maybe I should use a different approach.

Alternatively, for a given term in the Lagrangian, the mass dimension of the coupling is [κ] = dimension of term (4) minus sum of dimensions of the fields. Let's see:

Lagrangian term: κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait, that's κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, F. Wait, but σ is dimensionless, as we discussed earlier. So the sum is [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5. So [κ] =4 -5= -1.

Now, for the theory to be renormalizable, each coupling must have dimension ≥0? Or is it that the dimension must be ≥ something else? I think that a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has positive mass dimension. Because the coupling's dimension determines whether counterterms can absorb the divergences.

Wait, another approach: the interaction term is of the form
