Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can figure this out.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I should probably normalize this state because it's only proportional, not necessarily a unit vector.

Wait, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So they form an orthonormal basis. That means I can calculate the inner product to find the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's call the coefficients a and b. So a = (1+i), b = (2 - i). The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1.

Calculating |a|²: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. So |a|² is 2.

|b|²: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - i² = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/√7. So the actual state is (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>].

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, what's the matrix like?

Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix A is:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0 ]

Wait, but wait. Oh, no, wait. Let me recheck. The problem says Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, what operator has such a matrix? This looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, it becomes [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0 ]]. So operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the X operator. These are the eigenstates of the operator A as well, since A is a multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>.

So the question is, what's the probability of measuring the state |alpha> in |+x> and |-x>? And then find the average (expected value) of operator A.

First, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Wait, no, wait. I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The eigenstates of σ_x are such that σ_x |+x> = |+x> and σ_x |-x> = -| -x >. The standard expressions are:

|+x> = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>),
|-x> = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>).

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think about σ_x acting on |+x>:

σ_x |+x> = (|down> + |up>)/√2 = |+x>. So yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2.

So our state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, multiplied by 1/√7.

I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

To find c_+ and c_-, we can take the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the components. Let me write |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |-x> as (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So let's write |alpha> as:

(1/√7) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

We can express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

From |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2,

and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2,

We can solve for |up> and |down>.

Adding the two equations: |+x> + |-x> = 2|up> /√2 => |up> = ( |+x> + |-x> ) * √2 / 2 = (|+x> + |-x>)/√2.

Similarly, subtracting: |+x> - |-x> = 2 |down> /√2 => |down> = (|+x> - |-x> ) * √2 / 2 = ( |+x> - |-x> ) /√2.

So substituting into |alpha>:

(1/√7) [ (1+i) * (|+x> + |-x>)/√2 + (2 - i) * (|+x> - |-x>)/√2 ]

Simplify:

Factor out 1/(√7 √2):

= [1/(√7 √2)] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Expand the terms inside:

= [1/(√7 √2)] [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2-i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x> ]

Combine like terms for |+x> and |-x>:

Coefficient of |+x>:

(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 1 + i + 2 - i = 3.

Coefficient of |-x>:

(1 + i) - (2 - i) = 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [1/(√7 √2)] [ 3|+x> + ( -1 + 2i ) |-x> ]

Therefore, the coefficients are:

c_+ = 3 / (√7 √2 )

c_- = (-1 + 2i) / (√7 √2 )

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the modulus squared of these coefficients to get the probabilities.

So probability of |+x> is |c_+|², and probability of |-x> is |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

(3)^2 / (7 * 2) ) = 9 /14 ≈0.642857.

Wait 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 as the first probability.

|c_-|² is (| -1 +2i | )² / (7 * 2).

The magnitude of (-1 +2i) is sqrt( (1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(5). So squared is 5.

So |c_-|² = 5/(14) ≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36, which are option A.

Wait, but wait, let me check the coefficients again. Because when I expanded the terms, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the coefficients of |+x> and |-x>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 +i +2 -i = 3.

Wait, that's correct.

For |-x>, the coefficient comes from (1+i) (from the first term) and -(2 -i) (from the second term) multiplied by |-x>.

Wait, let me re-express the expansion:

From (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) = (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x>.

From (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) = (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x>.

So when we add these together:

The |+x> terms: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

The |-x> terms: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

Yes, correct.

So |c_+|² is (3)^2 / (7*2) )= 9/14 = approx 0.6428.

|c_-|² is | (-1 + 2i ) |^2 / (14) = (1^2 +2^2)/14 = 5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probability of measuring |+x> is 9/14, which is approximately 0.6428, and |-x> is 5/14, approximately 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, which matches the approximate values.

Now, the next part is to find the average value of operator A.

Operator A is given as the matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So, operator A can be written as (ħ/2) ( |up><down| + |down><up| ).

Alternatively, since we know that A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and the expectation value of σ_x in a state is given by <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

So the average value of A is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

But perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, let's compute it as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in the |up> and |down> basis, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/√7.

So let me write |alpha> as (1/√7) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So the expectation value is (1/√7) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]^† A (1/√7) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Wait, let me compute this.

First, the outer product: (1/√7)^2 = 1/7.

The inner product part is [ (1-i)(2 + i) ) |up><up| + ... etc. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value using the components.

Alternatively, the expectation value of A is given by (1/7) [ (1-i)(2+i) * (A_11 term? No, A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0 ]].

So when you compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/7) [ (1-i)(2 + i) (A_12) + (1-i)(A_11)* coefficient_down + (2 - i)(A_21) * coefficient_up + (2 -i)(1-i) A_22 ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it as:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1 - i)(2 + i) * (A_12) + (1 - i)(A_11)*0? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute it more carefully.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] /√7.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So matrix A is:

Row 1: [0, ħ/2 ]

Row 2: [ ħ/2, 0 ]

So, when you compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's:

[ (1-i)/√7  (2 + i)/√7 ] * A * [ (1 + i)/√7 ; (2 - i)/√7 ]

Wait, no, let me write it as a vector. The vector |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T /√7. So the conjugate transpose is [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ] /√7.

Multiply this by A, and then by |alpha>.

So, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ (1 - i)(2 + i) * (A_12) + (1 - i)(A_11) (2 - i) + (2 + i)*A_21 (1 + i) + (2 + i)(A_22)(2 - i) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as a matrix product.

Let me compute vector v = |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7, (2 -i)/√7 ]^T.

Then, A v is [ (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) / √7, ( (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) / √7 ].

So,

(A v)_1 = (ħ/2)(2 - i) / √7,

(A v)_2 = (ħ/2)(1 + i ) / √7.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = v† (A v) = (1/√7)(1 - i, 2 + i) * (1/√7)(A v terms )

Which is (1/7) [ (1 - i) * (ħ/2)(2 - i) + (2 + i) * (ħ/2)(1 + i) ) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = (2 -i -2i +i² ) = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So sum is (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

Multiply by ħ/2 * 1/7.

Wait, wait, let me compute step by step.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1. So 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Adding these two: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the total becomes (ħ/2) * (2) * (1/7) ) = (ħ/2)(2/7) = ħ/(7).

So the expectation value of A is ħ/7.

Wait, but wait. The options: option A says the average is ħ/7. Yes.

So putting it all together:

The probabilities are approximately 0.64 (9/14) and 0.36 (5/14), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are orthonormal eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The state is normalized by dividing by √7, resulting in:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle \right].
\]

The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \(A\), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \(A\) are the eigenstates of the Pauli-X operator, denoted as \(|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\text{up}\rangle + |\text{down}\rangle)\) and \(|-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\text{up}\rangle - |\text{down}\rangle)\). To find the probabilities, the state \(|\alpha\rangle\) is expressed in terms of \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle,
\]

where the coefficients \(c_+\) and \(c_-\) are calculated as:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Next, the average value of the operator \(A\) is calculated. Since \(A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x\), the expectation value of \(A\) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting the normalized state \(|\alpha\rangle\) and using the matrix representation of \(\sigma_x\), the expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of \(A\) is \(\hbar/7\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \(\hbar/7\).**

Answer: A
