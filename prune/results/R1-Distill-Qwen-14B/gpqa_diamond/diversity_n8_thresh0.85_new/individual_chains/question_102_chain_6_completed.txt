Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with vectors and gene expression. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question is about a bicistronic vector used to express a ligand and receptor. The setup involves Cre-LoxP systems and IRES elements. The researcher is trying to see if the constructs are expressed correctly, but when they look under the microscope for GFP, there's no green signal. So I need to figure out why that's happening.

First, let me break down the vector structure. The bicistronic vector has two ORFs: ligand and receptor. The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. 

Wait, IRES elements are Internal Ribosome Entry Sites. They allow for the translation of a second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA, right? So the first ORF (ligand) would be translated from a cap, and the IRES would drive the second ORF (receptor) without needing a new cap. 

But looking at the loxP and lox2272 cassettes: between ligand and mCherry is a stop with loxP, and between receptor and eGFP is a stop with lox2272. So in the vector, ligand is followed by a stop cassette, and then the IRES, then the receptor with its own stop cassette. 

Now, when the Cre is introduced, it would excise the stop cassettes. So, when Cre is present, the ligand ORF would be under the CBA promoter, and the stop is removed so that the ligand is expressed along with the mCherry (since mCherry is fused to ligand). Similarly, the IRES would drive the receptor's expression, and the stop cassette is removed so the receptor is expressed along with eGFP. 

Wait, but how does the Cre come into play here? Oh, right, the question says they have a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, no, the vector is the bicistronic construct, and the Cre is used to excise the stop cassettes. So in the absence of Cre, both ORFs would be under the control of the respective stops. So when the Cre is introduced (like in the mice crossed with SOX10-Cre), the stop cassettes are excised, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

In the Western blot, they tested for expression. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the proteins were expressed, they should see bands. But the question says that the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin loading. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, the signal is from actin, meaning that the loading is correct. But what about the proteins of interest? Well, maybe the blot didn't detect the overexpressed proteins, but the question doesn't give that detail. Or perhaps the blot is fine, but the GFP isn't showing up in the mouse model.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. The Cre would be expressed under the control of the SOX10 promoter, meaning Cre is active in neural crest cells and their derivatives. So, the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope. They expected to see green (from eGFP) but didn't. So why no green?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that affect GFP expression? The construct is supposed to express the receptor with eGFP, so if the receptor is expressed, GFP should be visible. Paracrine might mean the ligand acts elsewhere, but I don't think that's the issue here. The problem is expression of the construct.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. That could prevent GFP from being on the cell surface, making it not fluorescent under the microscope. If the protein is stuck in Golgi, it might accumulate there and not reach the cell membrane, so no GFP signal. But how would that happen? Maybe a signal peptide issue or incorrect glycosylation. But the vector is designed to have the receptor as a transmembrane protein. Alternatively, without proper signals, the protein might not traffic correctly. But is this the most likely reason in this setup?

Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter that should drive expression without tissue-specific regulation. The receptor uses an IRES, which doesn't require a promoter since it's after the first ORF. Wait, no, the IRES is part of the vector's design; perhaps the problem is that the promoter isn't sufficient for the receptor's expression. But wait, the IRES is a way to have two genes under a single promoter. So the CBA promoter drives the first gene (ligand), and the IRES allows the second gene (receptor) to be translated. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the promoter isn't active, but CBA is a strong promoter. Alternatively, maybe the CBA promoter is not active in the cells being looked at. But the ligand and receptor are expressed in neural crest cells. SOX10-Cre is activated in neural crest, so the construct should be active there. So perhaps the expression is not happening because the promoter isn't working, but I'm not sure. If the promoter is missing an enhancer, that could be a problem. But I'm not certain.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, the vector design says that the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor is expressed as a fusion protein with eGFP. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP would not be correctly expressed. But if the stop codon is in frame, then the receptor would be made but without eGFP. Alternatively, if the frame is wrong, the entire ORF could produce a premature stop codon, leading to no protein. But the vector is designed with a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is introduced, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a fusion. If the ORF is out of frame, the eGFP wouldn’t be correctly produced.

Wait, perhaps the way the vector is set up, after the IRES, the receptor is followed by a stop, which is then followed by eGFP. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the vector is ligand-ORF with a stop in loxP, then IRES, then receptor-ORF with a stop in lox2272, and then eGFP? No, wait, the description says: ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. Receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP. Between receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

Wait, that can't be right. I think I misread that. Let me read the vector structure again.

The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ligand is in frame with mCherry? Or is the ligand expression separate. Hmm.

Wait, if the ligand is at 5', and then a stop cassette, then the IRES comes after that, and the receptor is after the IRES. But the vector is bicistronic, so the mRNA is a single transcript. So the first ORF is ligand, which is under the CBA promoter, then the stop with loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, which is under the control of the IRES. The receptor is fused to eGFP, and between them is a stop in lox2272. So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 are excised.

Wait, so the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP. So both have their respective fluorescent proteins.

In the experiment, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They cross it to SOX10-Cre, which will induce Cre expression in neural crest cells (and possibly their derivatives). That should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see green (eGFP). So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options again. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent proper eGFP expression. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then the eGFP might not be correctly produced. Let's imagine the vector is ligand-ORF followed by stop (loxP), IRES, receptor-ORF with stop (lox2272), then eGFP. No, wait, the description said the receptor is at the 3' and fused to eGFP. So perhaps the receptor is in frame with eGFP, meaning that when the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP fusion is expressed. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP won't be correctly produced.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the receptor's ORF followed by a stop, and eGFP is after that. But in that case, the eGFP would be a separate ORF under the same promoter. But the description says the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So they must be in frame.

Wait, but if the stop is still present, the receptor would be expressed but not eGFP. So when Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are removed. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is gone, allowing the receptor-eGFP to be expressed as a single fusion protein.

If the reporter (eGFP) isn't being expressed, perhaps the frame is wrong. But why would that happen? Oh, perhaps the design has the receptor ORF followed by a stop, and then eGFP as a separate ORF, not in frame. So the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor and eGFP are in the same reading frame, allowing their expression as a fusion.

But if the vector is designed such that the receptor and eGFP are in the same frame, but during cloning, the ORFs were not correctly aligned, the eGFP might not be expressed. So when Cre is used, the stop is removed, but the receptor and eGFP are in different reading frames, so eGFP isn't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

Alternatively, if the eGFP is in the same frame, but the IRES is not working. The IRES is after the ligand's ORF, so it's supposed to drive the receptor's expression. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which should drive its expression, and the IRES is for the receptor. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, leading to no GFP.

Hmm, but the issue is that in the mouse, eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Cre isn't being expressed in the right cells. But the SOX10-Cre is supposed to be active in neural crest cells, which are where these proteins are expressed. So if the Cre isn't active, the stop cassettes remain, and the ORFs are not expressed.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. Hence, the construct should have the stop cassettes removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the eGFP is being expressed, but it's not on the cell surface. The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so the eGFP should be on the cell surface. If the protein is retained in the ER or Golgi, maybe it doesn't fluoresce. But if the construct is correct, the protein should traffic properly. But perhaps the addition of eGFP disrupts the proper folding or trafficking. For instance, if eGFP is added to the C-terminus, maybe the signal sequence is messed up or the protein is too large, causing it to misfold and be retained in the ER.

So option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That could lead to no fluorescence because the GFP isn't on the cell surface. But why would that happen? Maybe the addition of eGFP disrupts the protein's ability to traffic correctly. But without knowing more about the specific design, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, the expression levels are too low for detection. But the Western blot might have shown that.

Wait, let's think again. The Western blot uses total proteins, and the signal is proportional to actin. So perhaps both mCherry and eGFP are expressed, but the blot didn't detect them. But the question doesn't say that Western blot detected anything, which is confusing.

Wait, the question says that the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. So in the plasmid, the constructs are used, and the expression was tested. But the mouse model is a transgenic model, so the expression in the mouse might be different.

But perhaps in the vector design, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, but the receptor is under the control of the IRES. If the CBA promoter isn't active in the cells being examined (like in the mouse), the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But CBA is a strong, constitutive promoter, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive the second ORF, so that could be a problem.

Wait, another angle: the loxP and lox2272 are different sites. Cre from the loxP system (like in the vector) is used with Cre that recognizes loxP sites. But lox2272 is a variant of loxP that Cre can also recognize, but maybe it's recognized in a different way. So if the Cre isn't recognizing the lox2272 sites, then the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP isn't excised, meaning eGFP isn't expressed.

So when Cre is introduced, it should excise both loxP and lox2272 stops. But if the Cre used doesn't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. Wait, but common Cre lines usually recognize both loxP and lox2272 sites. Alternatively, maybe the vector uses a different Cre variant. Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. That might mean that it's a Cre-dependent vector, perhaps using the loxP sites for recombination. Wait, no— the vector is bicistronic and uses loxP and lox2272 for the stop cassettes, which are to be excised by Cre.

So if the Cre used in the mice can't cut lox2272, then the stop after the receptor would not be excised. Hence, the receptor ORF is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, because the stop is still present. Thus, eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

Wait, but the vector is designed with loxP and lox2272 stops. Are these compatible with standard Cre? I thought that Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272, but sometimes lox2272 is used with a different Cre variant, like Dre or another recombinase.

Wait, no. lox2272 is a lox site variant that is recognized by Cre, but with a higher specificity. So the Cre can still cut it, but perhaps less efficiently. However, in this scenario, the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is a standard Cre line. So if the Cre doesn't efficiently excise the lox2272 site, the stop cassette remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the vector design, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272. If the Cre doesn't excise the lox2272 site, then the receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, after SOX10-Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop (loxP) is cut, so ligand-mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed, thus no green signal.

So looking back at the options, none of them directly address this issue. Wait, option C mentions the enhancer is missing. But the enhancer isn't directly related to the lox sites.

Wait, perhaps the correct reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the lox2272 site isn't excised. But why? Because Cre isn't active, or because the site isn't recognized. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should drive Cre expression in the right cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox2272 site isn't in the correct orientation for Cre to cut, the stop cassette won't be excised.

Wait, the vector design says: between the receptor ORF and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So the stop is between receptor and eGFP, which are in the same ORF. So when Cre is introduced, it should delete the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed as part of the receptor-eGFP fusion.

If the Cre doesn't cut the lox2272 site, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the Cre not cut it? Because the Cre might not recognize it, or the sites are in the wrong configuration.

But in the options, there's no option that directly states this. So perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But why would the IRES not work? The IRES is supposed to drive the expression of the second ORF.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame. If the vector's design has the receptor followed by a stop, and then eGFP, but without an in-frame linker, the receptor and eGFP would be out of frame. But the question states that the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, implying that they are in frame.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette is between the ligand and mCherry, which is under the loxP. And the stop between receptor and eGFP is under lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed as a fusion. But if the eGFP is not in frame, perhaps it's not expressed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the ORF is not correctly spliced. Wait, but the vector is designed with IRES, so it's a single transcript. So the second ORF (receptor-eGFP) is under the IRES.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because of a lack of an ATG or something. But the vector is designed to have the ORFs correctly.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to eliminate options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. That doesn't explain why eGFP isn't expressed. It's about the relationship between ligand and receptor, not the expression construct.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. This could be a trafficking issue, but why would that happen? If the construct is correctly designed, the receptor should traffic to the membrane. Maybe the addition of eGFP disrupts this, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the promoter wouldn't drive expression. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. But without the enhancer, maybe it's not active in the right cells. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to drive Cre in neural crest, which is where the enhancer would be active. Not sure.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed correctly. So when the stop is excised, the receptor is expressed but without eGFP. So no green signal.

Wait, but if the eGFP is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So in the Western blot, the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP wouldn't. But the question says the Western blot was done after transfection but didn't mention the eGFP. Or did it? Let me read again.

The question says: "the Western blot [...] you use them to test the construct expression [...] you finally breed a mouse model [...] you cross it to SOX10-Cre [...] you visualize [...] no green signal."

So in the Western blot, the construct's expression was tested. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So maybe the blot showed that the receptor was expressed (but without eGFP). Or perhaps the eGFP wasn't detected because it's not present.

Wait, but why would the Western blot show the actin loading? That just means the loading is correct. So the blot probably detected the proteins, but maybe the eGFP wasn't detected because it's small or not expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot didn't detect eGFP because it's a small protein, but the receptor might have been detected. But the question doesn't provide that detail, so I'm not certain.

If the eGFP isn't being expressed, the most likely reason is that the stop cassette isn't being excised. So why wouldn't the stop cassette be excised? Because the Cre isn't active, or the Cre can't recognize the lox site.

But the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to drive Cre in neural crest cells. So the Cre is active.

Wait, another thought: The vector is bicistronic, and the IRES is after the ligand's ORF. The IRES allows for the expression of the receptor. But if the IRES is not functional, the receptor isn't expressed. So no eGFP. But why would the IRES not be functional?

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is from a virus (like EMCV) which requires certain conditions to work. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter and the receptor is after an IRES. So the IRES should drive receptor expression. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed.

But the problem is that the mouse model wasn't expressing eGFP, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But why?

Wait, maybe the lox2272 stop isn't being excised because the Cre doesn't recognize it, so the stop remains. So the receptor isn't expressed. Because the eGFP is after the stop, the stop remains, so the receptor isn't expressed. Wait, no. The receptor is in the same ORF as eGFP, perhaps.

Wait, the vector has the receptor's ORF followed by a stop that is flanked by lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a fusion. If the stop isn't removed, the receptor would be expressed but eGFP wouldn't. Alternatively, the stop is in the middle of the receptor's ORF, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the stop is in the middle of the receptor's coding sequence. So without the Cre, you have a stop in the middle, so the receptor isn't expressed. When Cre is introduced, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed along with eGFP. So if the stop isn't excised, the receptor isn't expressed, leading to no eGFP.

But why wouldn't the stop be excised? Because the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 site. So even though the Cre is active, the lox2272 isn't cut, so the stop remains.

So in that case, the reason is that the Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 site, so the stop isn't removed, and the receptor isn't expressed. But none of the options directly address this.

Looking again at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. So when Cre is introduced, the stop is removed, but the eGFP isn't made because the ORF is messed up.

So would that produce no eGFP? Yes. But the problem is whether the vector was designed correctly. If the vector was designed with the correct reading frame, then the issue isn't D. But if during cloning, the frame was wrong, then D applies.

Alternatively, if the IRES is not functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive the second ORF.

Alternatively, maybe the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, but the receptor relies on the IRES. If the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed. So no eGFP.

But without knowing more about the IRES, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being translated because the stop isn't removed. So the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't excised.

Wait, another possibility: the vector is designed to have the ligand first, then the IRES, then the receptor. But if the vector is in the wrong orientation, the IRES might not function. But the question says the vector is bicistronic, so it's designed correctly.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm going to make an educated guess. 

The most likely reason is that the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Why wouldn't the stop be excised? Because the lox2272 site isn't recognized by the Cre used, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But looking at the options, none directly state that. So perhaps the issue is that the IRES isn't functional, leading to no receptor expression. But the IRES is supposed to allow the receptor to be expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't correctly flanked, so even after Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another thought: the vector uses loxP and lox2272 in a way that the Cre can't excise both. But the mouse has SOX10-Cre, which can recognize both. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the eGFP is under a different promoter, which isn't active. But the question states that the receptor is at the 3' and fused to eGFP, so it's part of the same ORF after the IRES.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the vector is designed to have the eGFP under the control of the same promoter as the receptor. But if the promoter is insufficient, it might not drive eGFP expression. But the ligand is under CBA, which is strong, and the receptor is under IRES.

Hmm, given all that, I'm leaning towards option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident.

Another angle: when you use a stop cassette flanked by lox sites, the stop is removed, allowing the downstream ORF to be expressed in frame. If the vector is incorrectly designed, the ORF isn't in frame, leading to a frame shift. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly.

So in that case, when the Cre deletes the stop, the receptor ORF is expressed, but the eGFP isn't because it's out of frame. So no fluorescence.

So the answer would be D.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor fusion protein in neural crest cells. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, while the receptor is driven by an IRES element. Stop cassettes flanked by loxP and lox2272 sites are present between the ligand and mCherry, and between the receptor and eGFP, respectively. Cre expression, driven by SOX10-Cre, is expected to excise these stop cassettes, allowing both fusion proteins to be expressed. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope after crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre mice.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the absence of a green signal is related to the expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor. This option does not explain the lack of fluorescence.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP fusion protein were mis trafficked and retained in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, leading to no green signal. However, this issue would likely result from a design flaw in the construct (e.g., incorrect signal sequences) or post-translational modifications affecting trafficking. The question does not provide evidence to support such a trafficking defect, making this less likely.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong, constitutive promoter. The receptor is driven by an IRES, which does not require a promoter. While an enhancer could influence expression levels, the absence of an enhancer would not completely prevent expression. Additionally, the lack of fluorescence is specific to eGFP, not the ligand, making this option less likely.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly. This could occur if the vector was not designed properly, leading to a frame shift between the receptor and eGFP ORFs. When Cre excises the stop cassette, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP would not fluoresce due to the lack of proper fusion. This explanation aligns with the observed absence of fluorescence and is the most plausible reason.  

### Conclusion:  
The most likely reason for the absence of a green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper expression of the eGFP fusion protein.  

**Answer: D**
