Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these buffer solutions and phosphate ions. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says that there's a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO4^3-, in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, it forms a buffer solution. In this case, the two substances are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out what their forms are.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, right? And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (but the formula might be Na2HPO4·2H2O). So, when dissolved in water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water molecules, but the water might not directly affect the ions here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is Na2HPO4. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two are conjugate acid-base pairs because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, the solution is a buffer system consisting of H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). The H2PO4^- can donate a proton, and HPO4^2- can accept one.

The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, right? Wait, wait. No, no. Wait. Let me get this straight. H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. The different forms are:

H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, the first dissociation gives H2PO4^-, the second gives HPO4^2-, and the third gives PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. I think orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^3- ion. Or wait, no. Sometimes, orthophosphate is considered as the H3PO4 molecule, but I think in this context, the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^3-. So, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, but looking at the problem again: it says 'orthophosphate ions'. So, perhaps they mean HPO4^3- ions. But wait, looking at the components we have, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4·2H2O gives HPO4^2-. So, the ions present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the question is about HPO4^3-?

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but orthophosphate is HPO4^3- or H3PO4?

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the term orthophosphate is used to refer to the HPO4^3- ion. But in this buffer, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So, perhaps it's referring to the HPO4^2- ion, but I'm not totally sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about HPO4^3-, but then that's not present in the solution. Hmm.

Wait, no. The given substances are KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is HPO4^2-). So, the solution will have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. So when the question asks about orthophosphate ions, maybe it's the HPO4^2- ions? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe ortho refers to HPO4^3-, but that's not present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^3-, but in this buffer solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the first and second dissociation states. So, perhaps the orthophosphate ion, HPO4^3-, isn't present because the solution is buffered to a pH where HPO4^2- is the dominant form.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the buffer and the phosphate species. So, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The solution is a buffer with those two species. So, the concentration of each can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but that gives the ratio of their concentrations.

Wait, the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So perhaps the orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? But how much is there of that?

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, and the question is asking for the concentration of that. But I'm not entirely sure.

So, perhaps the first step is to calculate the moles of each component, then find their concentrations, and then set up the buffer equation.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each substance.

The formula for KH2PO4: The molar mass is given as 136.09 g/mol. So, 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol gives moles.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So, 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol gives moles.

Let me compute that.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005615 mol.

Wait, but when these salts dissolve in solution, they dissociate into ions. So, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So, the moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007343 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (the 2H2O might just be water of crystallization and don't affect the solution's ion concentration). So, the moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005615 mol.

Now, the total volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

So, the concentrations in the solution:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036715 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028075 M.

So, the buffer solution has these two concentrations.

Now, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Assuming orthophosphate refers to HPO4^3-, but I don't see how that's present here. Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the phosphate species:

H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, but that's the third deprotonation. However, our solution is a buffer between the first and second dissociations. So, under these conditions, the HPO4^3- concentration would be very low, as it's the third dissociation. But the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the term orthophosphate here refers to HPO4^2-.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem statement says, "the concentration of orthophosphate ions." Orthophosphate, in chemistry, refers to the HPO4^3- ion. Because ortho means adjacent, so in the context of phosphate ions, orthophosphate is HPO4^3- as opposed to polyphosphates. Hmm, but wait, actually, HPO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion, and H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. So, perhaps the question is asking for HPO4^3-, but in this solution, that's not the case because the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, if the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then the predominant species are the first and second dissociation products. The third dissociation (to PO4^3-) is much less, as Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), so PO4^3- would be negligible.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^3-. But in our solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so HPO4^3- would be in very low concentration.

So, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^3-) is very low. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo, and it's referring to HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^3-, and calculate its concentration.

To find [HPO4^3-], I can use the third dissociation constant, Ka3. Because HPO4^2- can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-.

So, the reaction is: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

But in the solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028075 M.

Wait, but the solution is also buffered with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation.

Wait, let's calculate the pH of the solution first. Because knowing the pH will allow me to find the concentration of HPO4^3-.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) and HA is the acid (H2PO4^-).

Wait, but wait. The second dissociation is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-; so the pKa2 is for that reaction. So in this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the conjugate base is HPO4^2-.

So, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.036715 M and 0.028075 M, respectively.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → pKa2 ≈ 7.209.

So, pH = 7.209 + log(0.028075 / 0.036715).

Calculating the ratio: 0.028075 / 0.036715 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approximately -0.115.

So, pH ≈ 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094.

Hmm, so the pH is about 7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of HPO4^3-.

The reaction for the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But [H+] can be calculated from the pH. pH = 7.094 → [H+] = 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.27e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028075) / (8.27e-8).

Let me compute that.

First, multiply 1.8e-12 by 0.028075: 1.8e-12 * 0.028075 ≈ 5.0535e-14.

Then, divide by 8.27e-8: 5.0535e-14 / 8.27e-8 ≈ 6.11e-7 M.

Wait, but 5.0535e-14 / 8.27e-8 ≈ (5.0535 / 8.27) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.611 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.11e-7.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.11e-7 M.

Wait, but that's the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the triply deprotonated form. The question is about orthophosphate ions, which I thought was HPO4^3-, but that's not present here. Wait, no, no, PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion. HPO4^3- is the dihydrogen phosphate? Wait, no, no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, actually, no. The phosphate ions have different forms:

- H3PO4: triprotic acid.

- H2PO4^-: dihydrogen phosphate.

- HPO4^2-: hydrogen phosphate.

- PO4^3-: orthophosphate.

Ah, right! So, the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, not HPO4^3-. So, in that case, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is [PO4^3-], which I've calculated as approximately 6.11e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close to this value. So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, let me recheck my calculations, in case I made any errors.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007343 mol. Correct.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005615 mol. Correct.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 / 0.2 = 0.036715 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 / 0.2 = 0.028075 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.209.

Ratio: 0.028075 / 0.036715 = approx 0.765.

Log(0.765) ≈ -0.115. So pH ≈ 7.094.

[H+] = 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.27e-8 M. Correct.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.27e-8).

1.8e-12 * 0.028075 = 5.0535e-14.

5.0535e-14 / 8.27e-8 = 5.0535e-14 / 8.27e-8 = approximately 6.11e-7.

Hmm, 6.11e-7 is close to 6.24e-7. Could there be a more precise calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me compute pKa2 more accurately.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Using a calculator, log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

So, pH = 7.2076 + log(0.028075/0.036715).

Compute the ratio: 0.028075 / 0.036715 = 0.7649.

Log(0.7649) = approximately -0.1153.

So, pH = 7.2076 - 0.1153 = 7.0923.

Then, [H+] = 10^-7.0923.

Compute 10^-7.0923. Let's compute this accurately.

10^-7 = 1e-7.

7.0923 = 7 + 0.0923.

So, 10^-0.0923 = ?

Using log tables or approximation:

We know that log(10^x) = x. So, 10^0.0923 = ?

Wait, wait, 10^0.0923 ≈ ?

Wait, 10^0.1 is about 1.2589.

But 0.0923 is a bit less than 0.1. So, let me compute it more accurately.

We can use the Taylor series or logarithm tables, but maybe using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, 10^0.0923 ≈ 1.238.

Wait, I can compute it using natural logs.

ln(10^0.0923) = 0.0923 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0923 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.2126.

e^0.2126 ≈ 1.237 (since e^0.2 is about 1.2214, e^0.2126 is about 1.237).

So, 10^-0.0923 = 1 / (10^0.0923) ≈ 1/1.237 ≈ 0.8078.

Wait, no, wait: 10^-0.0923 is 1 / (10^0.0923) ≈ 1/1.237 ≈ 0.8078.

But wait, 10^-7.0923 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0923) = 1e-7 * 0.8078 ≈ 8.078e-8.

So, [H+] ≈ 8.078e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.078e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028075 = 5.0535e-14.

Denominator: 8.078e-8.

So, 5.0535e-14 / 8.078e-8 = (5.0535 / 8.078) * 1e-6.

5.0535 / 8.078 ≈ 0.6258.

So, 0.6258e-6 = 6.258e-7 M.

Ah, that's about 6.258e-7, which is very close to option A) 6.24x10^-7 M.

So, the correct answer should be A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O), which are conjugate acid-base pairs. The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed via the third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, governed by the equilibrium:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007343 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.007343 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005615 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.005615 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.2 L. Thus:
- \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007343 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.036715 \, \text{M}
  \]
- \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005615 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.028075 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the second dissociation constant \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

- \(\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.209\)
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028075}{0.036715} \approx 0.765
  \]
- \(\log(0.765) \approx -0.115\)

Thus:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.209 - 0.115 = 7.094
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\)
The third dissociation constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The equilibrium expression for the third dissociation is:

\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.27 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028075)}{8.27 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

- Numerator:  
  \[
  (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028075) \approx 5.0535 \times 10^{-14}
  \]
- Denominator:  
  \[
  8.27 \times 10^{-8}
  \]
- \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0535 \times 10^{-14}}{8.27 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.11 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option A.
