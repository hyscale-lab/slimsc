Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth as we orbit the sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is, wait, wait, no. Wait, parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax. Oh right, distance d = 1/plx, where plx is in arcseconds and d is in parsecs.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution usually means that the number density is the same everywhere. But here, it's about the number per unit range of parallax. I need to find how the number of stars varies with parallax.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let me think about the volume. Since stars are spread out uniformly, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But how does parallax relate to volume?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So as plx decreases, d increases. But the volume around us depends on the distance. Let's think about a shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume would be 4π d² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dr.

But wait, since we're talking about parallax, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. Because plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the volume.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx depends on the volume at that distance. Let me see, the volume of a thin shell (like a spherical shell) is 4π d² dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. But since we need it in terms of parallax, let's express d in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx, so d^2 = 1/plx². And the thickness in distance, dd, is the change in d corresponding to a change in parallax dplx. Hmm, how are dd and dplx related?

Parallax plx = 1/d. So taking derivative: d(plx) = -1/d² dd. So plx = 1
