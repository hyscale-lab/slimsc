--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH at 240°C, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has some specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, which gives product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. That sounds like an elimination reaction, maybe dehydrohalogenation. But wait, KOH is a base, and heating would promote elimination. So if there are two bromine atoms in 1,3 positions, perhaps they eliminate to form a diene? Or maybe a single elimination, but since there are two bromines, maybe two eliminations.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in some way. But elimination reactions usually form double bonds. So perhaps KOH removes both Brs, leading to two eliminations, forming a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide? But the IR peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's around the carbonyl region. Oh wait, maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone or an ester?

Wait, another thought. If we have a dihalide reacting with KOH, maybe elimination forms an alkene. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like ketone or ester. So maybe the initial reaction is a substitution, not elimination. Hmm.

Wait, but KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's more likely to form an epoxide? But no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Hmm, I'm confused. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Brs are in positions that when eliminated, form a ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, product 1's NMR. The signals are at 4.79 (2H), which is around where an alcohol or an ether's protons might be. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably the adamantane ring protons. 1.94 (2H) could be another set of protons, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Since the IR has a peak at 1720, which is typical of a carbonyl, maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, because epoxides usually have peaks around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O-C stretch. Alternatively, maybe a ketone. But wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's an elimination to form an alkene and then a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: KOH could cause elimination, but if there are two Br atoms, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminating two Brs would form a diene. But then, what about the IR? A diene doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with two Br atoms, substitution with KOH would give a diol. So 1,3-diol. But the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H, which would fit for an -OH group, but wait, in NMR, OH protons usually appear broader and might not show as sharp peaks, unless it's an exchange or if it's an ether.

Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but for an epoxide, the NMR would show the protons adjacent to the oxygen as around 3-4 ppm, perhaps. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be adjacent to an oxygen, maybe as in an ether or an epoxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Brs are in positions that when KOH is added, it forms a geminal diol, but that doesn't seem right because gem diols are usually less stable and would further react.

Wait, let's think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 probably has a ketone or an ester group. But wait, if we have KOH and a dihalide, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction? No, Fittig is when two aryl halides couple in presence of Na metal to form a biaryl. But adamantane is an adamantane structure, not aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but two times, but that would give a diol, which doesn't fit the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for cyclic esters. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but not to a diene, but to form a carbonyl. For example, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, eliminating both could form a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is demetallation or something else. Oh, wait! Maybe it's an E2 elimination where two Brs are removed, leading to a conjugated diene. But as I thought earlier, that would give a diene, but no carbonyl. But the IR shows 1720, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is converted into a ketone via some kind of elimination. Oh! Wait, sometimes when vicinal dihalides are treated with a base, they can eliminate twice to form a carbonyl. For example, vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a ketone. So, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, but wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent, they're separated by one carbon.

Hmm, that complicates things. Because vicinal dihalides are 1,2-dihalides. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on non-adjacent carbons. So if you eliminate both, you can't form a conjugated diene. Maybe it's a 1,3-diene, but that's less common.

Wait, but maybe the structure is such that elimination from 1 and 3 positions forms a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's elimination to form a bridgehead double bond. Adamantane has bridgehead positions, so maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, which would be possible because bridgehead double bonds are allowed in some cases, like in norbornene.

But if that's the case, then the product would have a double bond, which might not explain the IR peak at 1720. Unless the base somehow caused a keto-enol tautomerism, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution to form an epoxide. But how? Epoxides are usually made from vicinal dihalides with a base. Wait, perhaps if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's not possible to form an epoxide because the Brs are not adjacent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be an -OCH₂- group. The 10H between 2.41-2.23 suggest all the CH groups in the adamantane structure. Then 1.94 (2H) could be -CH₂- groups attached to something else.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario. Hofmann elimination is when a quaternary ammonium salt is treated with a strong base to form an amine and an alkene. But that doesn't directly apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but again, that doesn't directly create a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diol, but then the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the diol then undergoes further reaction, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, maybe it's a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where both Brs are replaced by hydroxyl groups, forming 1,3-diol.

But then, the NMR would show -OH protons, but in the given data, the NMR shows 2H at 4.79. Maybe it's an ether instead. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination and then some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group. For example, if the structure is such that eliminating two HBr molecules forms a ketone.

Wait, for example, in the case of 1,3-dibromopropane, elimination of two HBr would form propene, but that's not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material isn't 1,3-dibromoadamantane, but perhaps a structure where the Brs are on adjacent carbons, but the numbering is off. Or perhaps the two Brs are on the same carbon, but that would be geminal. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond, but then a subsequent reaction forms a carbonyl. Wait, but under what conditions?

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol that undergoes oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless the diol is heated with something else, but the question says KOH is the only reagent.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is elimination to form an epoxide. But then the IR would show the epoxide's C-O-C peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, but the given IR is at 1720, which is a carbonyl.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about product 1. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which might be an -OCH2O- group, or perhaps an -OCH2- group. Or it could be a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 connected to something else.

Wait, with the IR showing a carbonyl, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How can 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone with KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-type elimination, but pinacol is a vicinal diol that eliminates to form a ketone. But in this case, we're starting with a dihalide. Oh, wait! The pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol, but perhaps if we have a 1,3-diol, it might not form a ketone via that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br, then elimination would form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't give a carbonyl. But if the structure is such that eliminating both Brs forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, but if they are on 1 and 3, that's not adjacent. So, perhaps the structure is like Br-C-C-Br, with the central C connected to other adamantane carbons. So eliminating two HBr could form a triple bond? Probably not because KOH is a base, not a strong dehydrohalogenating agent for triple bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on a bridgehead, and elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl. That might be possible.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what product 1 could be. The IR has a carbonyl, so it's a ketone or aldehyde. The NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which could be adjacent to an oxygen, like an -OCH2- group. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH, forming a diol. Then, the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation to form a ketone. But under what conditions? KOH is a base, but I don't think it can oxidize a diol to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol loses water to form a ketone. But that would require some kind of dehydration.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a gem-diol, which then loses two water molecules to form a carbonyl. For example, if two OH groups are on the same carbon, they can lose two H2O to form a ketone. But in this case, if the Brs are on 1 and 3 positions, the OHs would be on 1 and 3, not the same carbon.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether. The NMR at 4.79 (2H) could be an OCH2 group. But then, where's the carbonyl? Unless it's a carbonyl ether, which doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Then, the IR would show a peak around 1200-1250 for the C-O-C. But the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a ketone. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting dihalide is treated with KOH to form a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure how that would give a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but how? From a dihalide? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination where each HBr is eliminated, but the resulting structure somehow has a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-dibromide that upon treatment with KOH forms a carbonyl. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so it's not a gem-dibromide.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond lattice. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons.

So when treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated with a neighboring H, leading to a double bond. But if the bridgeheads have Brs, elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which is possible in adamantane derivatives. For example, in norbornene, which is a bicyclic compound with a bridgehead double bond.

So, perhaps product 1 is a bridgehead alkene. But then, where is the carbonyl? Unless further reaction occurs.

Wait, but product 1's IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps after elimination, there's a ring contraction or expansion that forms a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a diene, which then undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction, but without a dienophile, that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product after elimination forms a carbonyl via some rearrangement. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If KOH replaces each Br with an OH group, giving a 1,3-diol. Then, under heat, the diol could undergo some kind of cyclization or oxidation to form a ketone.

But again, with KOH as the only reagent, I'm not sure about oxidation.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the diol formed (1,3-adamantanediol) can undergo a Robinson annulation or some other reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol loses water to form a carbonyl. If the diol is cis or trans, perhaps it can form a carbonyl group via elimination. But elimination of two water molecules from a 1,3-diol would require specific conditions and geometry.

Alternatively, maybe the diol is heated with KOH, which could act as a base to dehydrate the diol. For example, if the diol is vicinal, the dehydration would form an alkene. But if it's 1,3, the dehydration would have to occur between non-adjacent OHs, which is less likely.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests some kind of CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. If product 1 is a diol, perhaps those 2H are adjacent to the OH groups, but in the NMR, the OH protons are usually broad or not seen if they exchange. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OCH3 group, but that's not likely with KOH.

Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling reaction. KOH is a strong base, and sometimes in the presence of two leaving groups, it can cause a coupling. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: When 1,3-dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes they can form a carbonyl via a double elimination. For example, if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo-2-methylpropane, elimination of two HBr could form acetone. So maybe in adamantane's case, eliminating two HBr from 1 and 3 positions would form a carbonyl group.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → when treated with KOH, eliminate two HBr to form a ketone, which would have the carbonyl peak in IR at 1720 cm⁻¹. That makes sense. So product 1 would be a ketone, say 2-adamantanone or something similar.

Then, the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) could be adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, but ketones typically don't have adjacent protons because the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, and the structure is such that there might be no protons attached directly to carbonyl carbons. Hmm.

Wait, in adamantane derivatives, the bridgehead carbons are quaternary, so they don't have any protons. So if product 1 is a ketone, the carbonyl would be at a bridgehead, and the adjacent carbons would have CH groups. So, perhaps the 4.79 ppm (2H) is not adjacent to the carbonyl but somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is not a ketone but an epoxide. Wait, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. Let's say product 1 is a diol. Then, when heated, it loses two water molecules to form a ketone.

But I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think about the next steps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps for Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an acylated compound.

Wait, but product 1 could be a ketone, which would make product 2 possibly an ester or an acid chloride, but the reagents don't suggest that. Alternatively, aluminum isopropoxide might be used in some kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether or an ester.

Wait, but product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which could be an -OCH2- group. Maybe product 1 is an ether, but I don't see how that would form from a dihalide with KOH.

Alternatively, product 1 could be an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I should think about product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene generally breaks the double bonds and forms carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl-containing compounds.

But the problem states that after ozonolysis and workup (with dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive workup), product 3 is formed. In reductive workup, the ozonides are broken into aldehydes or ketones without overoxidizing.

So, the product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative atom or a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's put it all together.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone (due to the IR peak), then when product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation or alkylation. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and then product 2 is a diol after some reaction.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the initial reaction.

If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a diene. The diene would have two double bonds? Or perhaps one double bond. Wait, but 1,3-dibromide is not a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a conjugated diene with one double bond.

Wait, for example, 1,3-dibromobutane would eliminate two HBr to form 1,3-butadiene. So perhaps in this case, the elimination forms a conjugated diene within the adamantane structure.

If product 1 is a diene, then the NMR would have peaks corresponding to the alkene protons. But the given NMR doesn't show peaks in the typical alkene region (around 5-6 ppm), except for 4.79 ppm, which is a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is part of a bridge structure, so the protons are in a different region.

But wait, the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit a diene. So that brings me back to thinking product 1 is a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is formed, and then under certain conditions, it tautomerizes to a ketone. That seems unlikely, though.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial reaction forms a diol, which then gets heated with KOH and perhaps undergoes a dehydration to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but product 1 is formed when heated with KOH. So perhaps the first step is elimination to form a diol, which then dehydrates to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a gem-dimethyl group that is oxidized, but again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated diene with an epoxide group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm stuck on determining product 1.

Wait, maybe the IR peak is not a carbonyl but something else. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, but it could be an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. Another possibility: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a conjugated enone. So, product 1 could be an enone.

But if product 1 is an enone, then the NMR would show protons in the diene region. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of an enone would cleave the double bond, leading to formation of carbonyl groups. But depending on the structure, the resulting product could have different coupling patterns.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is the same as product 1 because heating with aluminum isopropoxide doesn't change it. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a Friedel-Crafts acylation product. Suppose product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acylated benzene ring, but the question doesn't mention aromatic rings.

Alternatively, product 2 could be a more substituted double bond, perhaps formed via some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether. Then, ozonolysis of the ether would not make sense. Alternatively, product 2 is an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon heating with aluminum isopropoxide undergoes some elimination to form an alkene. Then, product 2 is an alkene, which undergoes ozonolysis to form carbonyl compounds.

If that's the case, then the NMR of product 3 would show protons adjacent to carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to outline the possibilities:

1. Product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol): NMR shows the OH protons as broad, but the data doesn't show that. Alternatively, the diol's protons are in the 2.41-2.23 ppm region, which are the adamantane CH groups.

2. Product 1 is an alkene: IR doesn't fit. Unless it's conjugated, but IR would show C=C.

Wait, back to product 1's NMR:

- 4.79 ppm (2H): maybe adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an OCH2 group.

- 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H): all the CH groups in adamantane.

- 1.94 ppm (2H): perhaps a CH2 group attached to something else.

So, perhaps product 1 is a substituted adamantane with an OCH2CH2 group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. The OCH2 would be adjacent to the oxygen. But then, the IR would show the C-O-C peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ether.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a glycol, where the diol has -OCH2CH2O- structure. But that doesn't make sense in adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm (2H) is an adjacent CH2 group. But in adamantane, the ketone's bridgehead doesn't have adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the ozonolysis step.

If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a conjugated diene, then ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, perhaps leading to a dialdehyde or diketone.

In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

If the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl and has two neighboring protons (like in a CH2 group), the coupling could be a triplet, quartet, etc.

Wait, but the question is about product 3's NMR. Let's think: after ozonolysis, the molecule breaks into two parts. Each part would have a carbonyl group. The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl, perhaps in a CH2 group next to it.

Suppose the original diene in product 2 is symmetric, so after ozonolysis, each fragment is the same. Then, each fragment would have a carbonyl group and some adjacent protons.

For example, suppose product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in adamantane, it's more complex.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would give a diketone, which would have equivalent protons.

Wait, but if the diene is part of a six-membered ring, ozonolysis would break it into two three-membered fragments, each with a carbonyl.

Hmm.

Alternatively, suppose product 2 is a monoene, not a diene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls.

So, for product 3, the most deshielded protons would be the ones next to the carbonyl groups. Their coupling would depend on how many neighboring protons they have.

If the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl and has two neighboring H's on each side, it would be a triplet of triplets or something else.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial product (product 1) is a diol, which upon heating with aluminum isopropoxide forms an ether (product 2). Then, product 2 is an ether with a double bond formed via elimination. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the most deshielded proton in product 3. It's likely to be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

In product 3, after ozonolysis, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. So, if those protons are in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would couple with two on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a quartet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would have two neighboring H's on each adjacent carbon, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group next to a carbonyl, which would have one neighboring H, leading to a doublet.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be the one closest to the carbonyl.

Let me think of a specific structure. Suppose product 2 is a diene, perhaps a 1,3-diene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically form a single carbonyl if it's a conjugated system. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 2 is a monoene. Ozonolysis would form two carbonyls. Suppose the structure is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, the protons on those CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyl and would couple with their adjacent protons.

If each CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would see two neighboring H's on each side. Wait, but a CH2 group only has two H's. So each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's on the same carbon (but that's geminal coupling, which is usually not observed in 1H NMR because they are equivalent). Alternatively, each H on the CH2 would couple with H's on adjacent carbons.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 is something like:

O=CH2-CH2-C=O

But that's not possible because such a structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, which would be a four-carbon chain with two carbonyls at each end. Each CH2 would have protons that are adjacent to carbonyls.

In that case, each CH2 would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H on the CH2 would couple with the other CH2's H's. For example, each H on CH2-1 would couple with the two H's on CH2-2, leading to a triplet.

So the splitting would be a triplet.

But wait, if each CH2 has two H's and is next to another CH2, each H would have two neighboring H's from the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2, each H would have two neighboring H's from the same CH2 (but they are equivalent and don't split), and two from the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two coupling partners, each with two H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, when a proton is coupled to two sets of equivalent protons, the splitting can be more complex. For example, if a proton is next to two groups each with two protons, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, but that's a higher multiplicity. Alternatively, if the two coupling partners are each two protons, the splitting would be a triplet for each, and the overall would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no. Let's think of it as each H on CH2-1 is coupled to two H's on CH2-2. Each coupling would split the signal into a doublet. So two couplings would result in a doublet of doublets. But if the two couplings are similar, it could appear as a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the splitting. Let me recall: Each coupling with n equivalent protons results in (n+1) peaks. So if a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with two protons, the total multiplicity would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the two couplings are to the same type of protons, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets. But that would require two different coupling constants.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. If each proton on the CH2 is next to another CH2 with two H's, each H would split into a triplet (from the adjacent CH2), making the overall pattern a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets only if there are two different coupling partners. But in this scenario, the adjacent CH2's protons are equivalent, so each H on CH2-1 would couple with both H's on CH2-2, but since they are equivalent, it would just be a triplet.

So the most deshielded H's (those next to the carbonyl) would be in a triplet.

Thus, the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is treatment with KOH at 240°C, which likely results in a double elimination reaction to form a ketone, as supported by the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ (indicative of a carbonyl group). The NMR data for product 1 (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure where the ketone is part of the adamantane framework, with protons adjacent to the carbonyl group appearing at 4.79 ppm.

In the second step, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, likely forming an alkene (product 2) via elimination. This alkene is then subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, producing product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing fragments in product 3.

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely located near a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would experience coupling with adjacent protons. If the hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, it would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, where each proton couples with two equivalent protons on the neighboring CH2.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of protons, which is not supported by the structure.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one proton and two equivalent protons, which is inconsistent with the structure.
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is not possible in this scenario.

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a triplet coupling pattern due to its interaction with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group.
