Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration of acetic acid will be half because the volume doubles. Let me calculate that.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So now the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when we start titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will react with a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. 

At 25% titration, how much NaOH have we added? Let's think about the equivalence point first. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so the moles of NaOH needed would also be 0.001. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So 10 cm³ is the equivalence point.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of that volume, which is 2.5 cm³. So we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So at 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 moles, the moles reacted are 0.00025, so remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 moles, and the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025.

But wait, the solution after adding NaOH will have a total volume. The initial solution was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³ NaOH, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.
