Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are four different compounds, mainly substituted benzoic acids or benzene derivatives. The data given are IR and NMR spectra.

First, let me look at the spectroscopic data to figure out what compound X is.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretch. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. Also, the broad IR suggests maybe an -OH group, possibly from a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. That aligns with the IR's 1720 cm-1 peak. So, compound X is likely a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are typically around 9-10 ppm, and a singlet. But the integration is 1H, so maybe an acidic proton like -COOH.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are doublets that suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two doublets each integrating for 2H, so probably two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no, each doublet is 2H, so maybe a single substituent in the para position. For example, a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position and maybe another group elsewhere.

Wait, let me think. The benzene ring in the NMR shows two doublets each integrating 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, perhaps the substituent is in the para position relative to another group? Or if the substituent is such that it causes two doublets, maybe the substituent is a group with adjacent Hs. Wait, no. For example, if the substituent is at the para position, and another substituent is in a position that affects the protons. Hmm, maybe it's a disubstituted benzene with substituents para to each other. Let me think. Let's say substituents at positions 1 and 4. Like 4-X-phenyl group. So the NMR would show two doublets of 2H each, which matches the data here.

Then, the other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to another group. Possibly a CH next to a carbonyl or something.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for two protons, maybe adjacent to a CH group. Perhaps part of a CH2CH2... structure.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating for 3H. That's a methyl group attached to something that splits into a doublet. So, maybe a CH(CH3) group, where the methyl is attached to a carbon that's next to another CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three protons, probably a methyl group attached to a CH2. Like a ethyl chain, such as CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the structure seems to have a benzene ring with a substituent that is a carbonyl group. Since the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is about right for a carbonyl. The broad peak in IR and the 10.5 ppm H suggest it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but is it a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene? Because that would make the NMR show a triplet for the methyl and a quartet for the adjacent CH2. Or maybe another substituent.

Wait, no. Let me think. The IR has 1720, which is more like an ester or ketone, but the broad peak in IR could be an -OH from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an acid derivative. Hmm, but let's consider the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, so the compound should have a -COOH group. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl in IR would be around 1700, which fits. Also, the broad peak in IR (3400-2500) suggests O-H stretching from the carboxylic acid.

So, the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent. The NMR shows a para-substituted benzene, so the substituents are at para positions. One substituent is -COOH, and the other is some group.

Wait, the NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's for the aromatic protons. So, in a para-substituted benzene, like 4-ethylbenzoic acid or something similar.

Wait, but let's think about the substituent that's not the COOH. Let's see the other NMR signals:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a methylene or methine attached to a branch. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could
