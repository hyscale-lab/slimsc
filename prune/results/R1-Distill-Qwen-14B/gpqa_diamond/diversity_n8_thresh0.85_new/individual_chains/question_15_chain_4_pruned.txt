Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So, the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits.

The host stars have different masses and the same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which is why their radii are the same even though their masses are different. Hmm, because more massive stars are usually bigger, but if Planet_2's star is evolved, maybe it's expanded despite being less massive. Interesting.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So I need to calculate or compare the transit probabilities of the two.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula for the transit probability (P) is something like the area of the planet's orbital path that would cross the star's disk. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think. I think the transit probability is actually the ratio of the areas of the planet's orbit that would cause a transit. So the probability P is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius... No, wait, I'm getting this a bit mixed up.

Let me recall the formula. The transit probability formula is (R_star / a)^2 Ã— ( (R_planet + R_star) / R_star )^2, but wait, no, I think in the case where the planet's size is much smaller than the star, it simplifies. So the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by (sin i)^2, where i is the inclination. But since the planets have already been detected via RV, which doesn't depend on inclination, their RV measurements can give us the minimum mass, but inclination could vary. Wait, but when it comes to the transit method, the
