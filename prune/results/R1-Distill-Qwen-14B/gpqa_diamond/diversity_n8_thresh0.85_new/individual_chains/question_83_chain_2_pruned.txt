Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the reaction should form the acetate ion and water.

The given data: We dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Wait, because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution.

So, originally, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume. So the initial concentration becomes (0.05 M) * (20/40) = 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. That's the concentration before any titration.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. Oh wait, wait, what's the 25% referring to? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point. So I need to find how much NaOH is added when we reach 25% of the equivalence point.

So, first, perhaps I should find the equivalence point.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

So, moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Oh, right, same as before, because 20 cm³ * 0.05 M is 0.001 moles, and then same after dilution because we're just adding water.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

Then, 25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, that's the 25% point.

Now, for the 25% point, we're dealing with a buffer solution because it's before the equivalence point. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

But wait, let me think about the moles. So, how much acetic acid and acetate are present at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O), the moles of acetic acid consumed would be 0.00025 moles
