Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I remember that operators and their matrix representations are key in quantum mechanics, so I'll need to use that.

The state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's a scalar multiple, right? So we'll need to normalize it because the probabilities must add up to 1. 

First, I think I should write down the state properly. Let me denote |up> as |↑> and |down> as |↓> for simplicity. So |alpha> = (1+i)|↑> + (2 - i)|↓>. To normalize, I need to find the norm squared, which is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Calculating the normalization factor: the coefficient of |↑> is (1+i). The absolute square is |1+i|^2 = (1^2 +1^2) = 2. Coefficient of |↓> is (2 - i), so |2 - i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |↑> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |↓>.

Wait, why do I need to normalize? Because probabilities are based on the squared magnitudes of the amplitudes. So if the state isn't normalized, the probabilities won't add to 1. That's correct.

Next, the operator's matrix representation is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix (since it's spin-1/2, so two states |↑> and |↓>), the operator matrix A would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are ħ/2. So this looks like a spin operator in the x or y direction? Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So A is similar to X multiplied by ħ/2, but without any i factors, so maybe it's another operator.

But perhaps it's just a given operator, so I need to find its eigenstates and eigenvalues, because the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when measuring in the eigenbasis of A.

Wait, but the question says calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So the eigenstates of A are the states in which measuring A would give a definite value. The eigenvalues would be the possible outcomes.

So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Let me find the eigenvalues of A. The matrix is 2x2:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0.

So determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found, but maybe I don't need them for this problem. Because when measuring, the probabilities are the square of the components of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

Wait, so alternatively, perhaps I can find the expectation value of A, which is the average value. Because the average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average value of A. But the first part is the probabilities for each eigenstate.

Wait, but the operator A is given, and we need the probabilities when measuring in its eigenbasis. So |alpha> is expressed in the standard basis (|↑> and |↓>), and we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, then the square of the coefficients would give the probabilities.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the given state. Because the expectation value is Tr(A rho), where rho is the density matrix. Alternatively, using the state |alpha>, <alpha| A |alpha> gives the average.

Wait, but the question says "calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator." So each eigenstate would be the two possible states corresponding to each eigenvalue. So for each eigenstate, the probability is the square of the amplitude when you project |alpha> onto that eigenstate.

Hmm, but perhaps another approach: the operator A is a 2x2 matrix, so it has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Let me find those.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0 → [ [-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2] ] v = 0.

So the equations are (-ħ/2)a + (ħ/2)b = 0 → a = b.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the equations would give a = -b. So eigenvectors (1, -1).

Wait, but wait—those are for the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is X. In our case, the matrix A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], so the eigenvectors would be same as X, just scaled? Because X has eigenvalues ±1 and eigenvectors (1,1) and (1,-1). Our matrix A is (ħ/2) X, so the eigenvectors are same as X's, but the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(±1), which gives ± ħ/2 as we found.

So the eigenstates of A are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), multiplied by the eigenvalues.

Wait, but the exact normalized eigenvectors would be |+> = (|↑> + |↓>) / sqrt(2) and |-> = (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2), but scaled by the operator? Wait, no, because the operator A is (ħ/2) X, so the eigenstates are the same as X's, which are the same as the spin-x basis.

So when we express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, the coefficients' squares would give the probabilities.

So let's proceed.

First, write |alpha> in terms of |↑> and |↓> as before:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |↑> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |↓>

Now, express this in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->.

|+> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2)

So we can write |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

We can find a and b by taking inner products.

a = < + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 1) ] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Wait, let me compute it. Alternatively, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->:

|alpha> = c1 |+> + c2 |->

Expressing |+> and |-> in terms of |↑> and |↓>:

|+> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2)

So:

|alpha> = c1 (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |↑> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |↓>

Compare this to |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |↑> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |↓>

So equating coefficients:

(c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
(c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

We can set up these two equations:

1) (c1 + c2) = (1+i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)
2) (c1 - c2) = (2 -i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)

Wait, wait, let me correct that. Let me write:

(c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7) → equation (1)
(c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → equation (2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

c1 + c2 = (1 + i) sqrt(2/7) → equation (1a)
c1 - c2 = (2 - i) sqrt(2/7) → equation (2a)

Now, adding equations (1a) and (2a):

2c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
→ c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(2) * sqrt(2/7)

Subtracting (2a) from (1a):

2c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7)
→ c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 = (-1 + 2i)/(2 sqrt(7/2)) ) → wait, perhaps better to compute it numerically.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the square of the magnitudes of c1 and c2 to get the probabilities.

But perhaps an easier approach is to compute the probabilities directly by projecting |alpha> onto |+> and |->.

The probability for |+> is |< + | alpha > |².

Compute < + | alpha >:

= [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 -i) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))
= [ (1 + i + 2 - i ) ] / (sqrt(14))
= (3) / sqrt(14)

So the probability is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Wait, that's about 0.64, which matches one of the options.

Then the probability for |-> is |< - | alpha > |². Let's compute that.

< - | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1)(1+i) + (-1)(2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))
= [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(14)
= (1 +i -2 +i ) / sqrt(14)
= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357. So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36). So the first two numbers in the options are 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64
