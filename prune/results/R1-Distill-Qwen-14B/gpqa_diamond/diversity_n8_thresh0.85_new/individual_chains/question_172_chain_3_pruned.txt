Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms relates to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level (or population ratio) is n1/n2 = 2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, assuming the ground state and an excited state, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. If we're considering the same transition, maybe the statistical weights are the same, so g_i/g_j is 1. So the equation simplifies to n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference.

But wait, wait, I think I might have mixed up the states. Suppose the higher energy state is level 2 and lower is level 1. Then, n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), because the higher energy level has a lower population. Or wait, no, if star_1 has more excited atoms, then perhaps for star_1, the number in the higher level is higher. So maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, n1 (excited state) is twice as much as in star_2. So n1_1 = 2 * n1_2. Wait, but I'm not sure if n is the excited or ground state. Let me clarify: the question says the specific energy level is twice as excited, so perhaps it's the number in that level. So if in star_1, the number in the excited level is n1, and in star_2, it's n2, then n1 = 2 n2.

So n1_1 / n1_2 = 2. But each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2. So the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

For star_1: n1_1 / n2_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: n1_2 / n2_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, wait: actually, the ratio of the populations in each star would be given by the same equation. Wait, but in each star, the ratio of the excited level to a lower level is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, perhaps the question is comparing the same transition in both stars. Let me assume that the same energy difference ΔE is considered for both stars. So for each star, the excitation ratio is given by (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star_1, the ratio (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) 
For star_2, (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = exp(-ΔE/(k
