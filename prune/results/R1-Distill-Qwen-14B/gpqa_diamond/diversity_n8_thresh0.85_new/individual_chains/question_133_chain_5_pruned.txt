Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, right? And in this solution, there are two substances: 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the three dissociation constants (Ka1, Ka2, Ka3) for H3PO4. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO₄³⁻, in this solution.

Hmm, so I need to find [PO₄³⁻]. I remember that in phosphoric acid solutions, the species present depend on the pH and the dissociation steps. The problem involves a buffer solution because we have two different phosphate salts. KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H2PO4⁻, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate dihydrate, which is HPO4²⁻.

Wait, wait. Let me think. KH₂PO4 dissociates into K+ and H₂PO4⁻. Na₂HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4²⁻. So in solution, we have H₂PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. These can act as buffer components.

I remember that the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful for buffer solutions. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, in which context is this applicable here? Because H3PO4 has three dissociation steps.

Let me recall the dissociation steps:
1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4⁻, with Ka1 = 7.5e-3.
2. H2PO4⁻ → H+ + HPO4^2-, Ka2 = 6.2e-8.
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So the solution contains H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- ions. Which of these is the acid and which is the base in the buffer? Well, H2PO4⁻ can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so H2PO4⁻ is the acid), and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- (so HPO4^2- is the acid in a higher pH scenario).

Wait, but the buffer is between H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-? Because those are the two species present in the solution. So the relevant pKa would be Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. The pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)), wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 is about 7.21, because log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 but negative exponent, so wait, wait. Let me calculate it properly.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21. Right, because 1e-7 is pH 7, and 6.2e-8 is a bit higher than 1e-7, so higher pH. So the buffer is around pH 7.21.

But wait, the solution has both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2-; so the buffer is between these two. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- which is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-. So in solution, some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

So the concentration of PO4^3- would come from the dissociation of HPO4^2- in solution. To find [PO4^3-], I might need to consider the Ka3 value.

But wait, first things first: I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

The solution is made by adding 1.00 g of each salt into 200 mL. So I can calculate the moles of each.

Moles of KH₂PO4: mass (g) / Mw. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let me compute
