Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I think the key here isn't their masses, but their elemental abundances. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Wait, the given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the Sun's photosphere has specific values: 12 + log(nFe/nH) is 7.5, same for Mg as 7.

I remember that the square brackets [X/Y] mean the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun = log10(nX/nY / (nX_sun / nY_sun))).

Wait, actually, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - (log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun). So it's like the logarithm of (X/Y in star) divided by (X/Y in sun).

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun. Because [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y) / (X/Y)_sun ), so (X/Y) = (X/Y)_sun * 10^[X/Y].

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) divided by (Fe/H)_sun. If [Fe/H] is 0, that means (Fe/H) = (Fe/H)_sun. So Fe abundance is the same as the Sun in Star_1.

Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] would be 0 by definition, right? Because it's comparing to itself. So Star_1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but the problem says [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So yes, Fe in Star_1 is solar.

Okay, same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg is at solar abundance. [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so Mg/Si in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.

Wait, but I think I need to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2. So the problem is, find (n_Si_1)/(n_Si_2).

Hmm. Let me think about how to compute this.

First, let's find the ratio of Si to Fe in each star, and since Fe is the same in both, maybe we can relate them.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, Fe in Star_1 is solar. So (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So (Fe)_1 = (Fe)_sun * (H)_1 / (H)_sun.

Wait, but H is the denominator in [Fe/H], which is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider everything relative to the Sun.

Let me write down the given data:

Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun)

But I'm not sure if I'll need the actual H counts. Maybe I can find the ratio of Si in each star and then take the ratio.

Wait, for Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.

In the Sun, (Si/Fe)_sun is (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = let's compute that. Wait, from the given data, the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5.

So nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → 3.16e-5? Wait, because 10^-4.5 is 3.16e-5. Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^-5 → 1e-5.

But wait, how about nSi_sun? I don't have that data. Hmm. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Mg and Si. Let's see.

In Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg/Si)_sun.

But in the Sun, (Mg/Si)_sun is (nMg_sun / nSi_sun). Because [Mg/Si]_sun would be log10( (Mg/Si)_sun / (Mg/Si)_sun ) = 0, but wait, no, the definition is [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ), so in the Sun, [X/Y] is zero.

Wait, but perhaps in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, but that's not what is given. Wait, no, the given [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. Oh, wait, but the Sun's [Mg/Si] is [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (Mg/Si)_sun / (Mg/Si)_sun )=0. So in Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/Si)_sun *10^0.3.

So (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg_sun/Si_sun) * 10^0.3 → but wait, is that correct?

Wait, yes: [Mg/Si]_2 = log10( (Mg/Si)_2 / (Mg/Si)_sun ) = 0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/Si)_sun * 10^0.3.

But I don't have (Mg/Si)_sun. But I do have Mg and Fe, and Fe and H.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the ratios in terms of H, then relate to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Si in terms of Fe, and Mg in terms of Fe, using the given data.

Let me try this.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe] = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si_1/Fe_1) = (Si_sun/Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait, in the Sun, Si_sun/Fe_sun is (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun). Let me compute that.

Wait, from the Sun's data:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → because 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

Similarly, nMg/nH_sun = 10^(-5), because 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10( nMg/nH )=7-12=-5.

But I don't have nSi/nH_sun directly. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can get it from the Mg and Si ratios in the Sun. But I don't have [Mg/Si]_sun given. Oh wait, in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] is [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (Mg/Si)_sun / (Mg/Si)_sun )=0. So the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero, which means (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/Si)_sun, which is trivial.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (Mg/Si)_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero, so (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/Sun)/(Si/Sun) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) / (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * (nH_sun / nSi_sun) ) = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) → which is (Mg/Si)_sun.

So, (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) / (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) = (nMg/nSi)_sun.

Wait, but I don't have nSi/nH for the Sun. Hmm. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe I can get (Si/Fe)_sun from the given data. Let's see.

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → nFe_sun = nH_sun * 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, nMg_sun = nH_sun * 10^(-5).

But without nSi_sun, I can't directly compute (Si/Fe)_sun.

Hmm. Maybe I can express (Si/Fe)_1 in terms of (Si/Fe)_sun, and then find the ratio of Si in the two stars.

Wait, but I don't know (Si/Fe)_sun. So perhaps that approach won't work.

Alternative approach: Let me consider the composition ratios relative to H.

In Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

Similarly, because [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

But if I assume LTE and the same H for both stars? Wait, but photospheres have different H depending on their composition. Or maybe I can express the ratios in terms of solar H. But perhaps it's easier to normalize everything to the Sun's composition.

Alternatively, let's express each element's abundance in terms of H.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun ) = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si/Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But (Si/Fe)_sun = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = ?

Wait, from the Sun's data, n_Fe_sun = n_H_sun * 10^(-4.5), and I don't know n_Si_sun.

Hmm. Maybe I can express Si in terms of Mg or other elements.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each element's abundance in terms of H.

Let me try this:

In the Sun:

n_Fe_sun = n_H_sun * 10^(-4.5)
n_Mg_sun = n_H_sun * 10^(-5)
n_Si_sun = n_H_sun * 10^x → but I don't know x.

Wait, but in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] is zero, so [Mg/Si]_sun = 0 → (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/Si)_sun → which is (nMg/nH)/(nSi/nH) ) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) / (nSi_sun / nH_sun) ) = nMg_sun / nSi_sun = (10^-5) / (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) → Wait, no, nMg_sun is 10^-5 * n_H_sun.

Wait, let me write it down.

In the Sun:

nMg = 1e-5 * nH_sun
nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH_sun
nSi = ? → let's say nSi = y * nH_sun.

So [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) → but wait, (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) is (nMg/nSi)_sun.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should find the ratio (Si_1 / Si_2) directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio.

Wait, let's think about Star_1 first.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si_1/Fe_1) = (Si_sun/Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

And [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

Wait, but if I express everything in terms of H, perhaps I can find (Si/H)_1.

Because (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si_1 / Fe_1) = (Si_1 / (Fe_sun * H_1 / H_sun)) ) → because Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

Wait, (Fe_sun) is nFe_sun = n_H_sun * 10^(-4.5).

So Fe_sun = n_H_sun * 1e-4.5.

Thus,

(Si_1 / Fe_1) = (Si_1) / (Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun)) )

But I can write Si_1 = (Si_1 / H_1) * H_1.

So,

(Si_1 / Fe_1) = [ (Si_1 / H_1 ) * H_1 ] / [ Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun) ) ]

= (Si_1 / H_1) * H_1 / (Fe_sun * H_1 / H_sun )

= (Si_1 / H_1 ) * H_sun / Fe_sun

Because H_1 cancels out.

So,

(Si/Fe)_1 = (Si_1 / H_1) * (H_sun / Fe_sun )

But (Fe_sun) = nFe_sun = n_H_sun * 1e-4.5.

So,

(Si_1 / H_1) = (Si/Fe)_1 * (Fe_sun / H_sun )

= (Si/Fe)_1 * 1e-4.5.

But (Si/Fe)_1 is (Si/Fe)_sun * 10^0.3 → because [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

Thus,

(Si_1 / H_1) = (Si/Fe)_sun * 10^0.3 * 1e-4.5.

But (Si/Fe)_sun = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = (n_Si_sun / (n_H_sun * 1e-4.5)).

Hmm, this seems to loop back. Maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternative Approach:

Let me define the following:

In the Sun:

n_Fe = F * n_H → F = 1e-4.5 = 3.16e-5.

n_Mg = M * n_H → M = 1e-5.

n_Si = S * n_H → S is what I'm trying to find? Maybe.

Wait, but I don't have S. Hmm.

But [Mg/Si] in the Sun is zero.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (Mg/Si)_sun / (Mg/Si)_sun ) = 0. So, (Mg/Si)_sun = 1.

Which implies that (Mg/Si)_sun = (n_Mg / n_Si)_sun = (M * n_H) / (S * n_H) ) = M/S.

So, (Mg/Si)_sun = M/S = 1 → S = M.

So, S = M = 1e-5.

Ah! That's a breakthrough. So n_Si_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

So, (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) = 1e-5.

So, in the Sun:

n_Fe = 1e-4.5 * n_H
n_Si = 1e-5 * n_H
n_Mg = 1e-5 * n_H

Wait, is that correct? Because [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, so Mg and Si are in the same ratio as the Sun.

So, (Mg/Si)_sun = (n_Mg/n_H)/(n_Si/n_H) ) = (n_Mg/n_Si) ) = 1 → M/S =1 → S = M.

So, yes, n_Si_sun = n_Mg_sun.

So now, I can compute (Si/Fe)_sun:

(Si/Fe)_sun = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) = (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = 1e0.5 = sqrt(10) ≈3.162.

Wait, because 1e-5 / 1e-4.5 = 1e^(-5 +4.5) )=1e-0.5= 1/sqrt(10)=≈0.316.

Wait, no: 1e-5 is 10^-5, and 1e-4.5 is 10^-4.5.

So 1e-5 / 1e-4.5 = 10^(-5 +4.5) = 10^-0.5 = 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.316.

Ah, so (Si/Fe)_sun ≈0.316.

Okay, so back to Star_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si_1/Fe_1) = (Si/Fe)_sun *10^0.3.

Which is 0.316 * 10^0.3.

10^0.3 ≈ 2. So 0.316 * 2 ≈ 0.632. So (Si/Fe)_1 ≈ 0.632.

But wait, more accurately: 10^0.3 is approximately 1.995, so about 2.

So (Si/Fe)_1 = 0.316 * 1.995 ≈ 0.63.

Now, Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → so Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

So, (Fe_1) = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

Similarly, (Si_1) = (Si_1 / H_1) * H_1.

We can express (Si_1 / H_1) in terms of [Si/Fe]_1 and (Fe_1 / H_1)_sun.

Because (Si_1 / Fe_1) = 0.63 → Si_1 = 0.63 * Fe_1.

But Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

So,

Si_1 = 0.63 * Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

But Fe_sun = n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun.

So,

Si_1 = 0.63 * 1e-4.5 * n_H_sun * (H_1 / H_sun).

But H_1 is the number of hydrogen atoms in Star_1, and H_sun is that in the Sun.

But I don't know H_1 or H_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express (Si_1 / H_1) in terms of (Fe_sun / H_sun) and (Fe_1 / H_1).

Because,

(Si_1 / H_1) = (Si_1) / H_1 = (0.63 * Fe_1) / H_1 = 0.63 * (Fe_1 / H_1).

But (Fe_1 / H_1) = (Fe_sun * H_1 / H_sun ) / H_1 ) = Fe_sun / H_sun.

So,

(Si_1 / H_1 ) = 0.63 * (Fe_sun / H_sun ) = 0.63 * (1e-4.5 ).

Ah, since Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 * H_sun.

So,

(Si_1 / H_1 ) = 0.63 * 1e-4.5.

So,

(Si_1 / H_1 ) = 0.63 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 1.99e-5.

Wait, 1e-4.5 is approximately 3.16e-5, so 0.63 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 1.99e-5.

So, (Si_1 / H_1 ) ≈ 2e-5.

Similarly, in Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg_2/Si_2 ) = (Mg/Si)_sun *10^0.3.

But (Mg/Si)_sun = 1, as we found earlier.

So, (Mg/Si)_2 = 1 * 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun → Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun).

But Mg_sun = 1e-5 * H_sun.

So, Mg_2 = 1e-5 * H_sun * (H_2 / H_sun ) = 1e-5 * H_2.

So, (Mg_2 / H_2 ) = 1e-5.

But (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg_2/Si_2 ) = 2.

So,

Mg_2 = 2 * Si_2.

But Mg_2 = 1e-5 * H_2.

So,

1e-5 * H_2 = 2 * Si_2 → Si_2 = (1e-5 * H_2 ) / 2 → (Si_2 / H_2 ) = 5e-6.

So now, I have (Si_1 / H_1 ) ≈ 2e-5 and (Si_2 / H_2 ) ≈5e-6.

But wait, what is the ratio of Si_1 to Si_2? It's (Si_1 / H_1 ) * H_1 / ( (Si_2 / H_2 ) * H_2 ) ) → which is (Si_1 / H_1 ) / (Si_2 / H_2 ) ) * (H_1 / H_2 ).

But I don't know H_1 or H_2. Oh wait, but I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. So n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

Which is (n_Si_1 / H_1 ) * H_1 / (n_Si_2 / H_2 ) * H_2 ) = (n_Si_1 / H_1 ) / (n_Si_2 / H_2 ) ) * (H_1 / H_2 ) )

But without knowing H_1 and H_2, I can't proceed unless H_1 = H_2. But that's not given. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Maybe the ratio of silicon is (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2 ) = ( (Si_1 / H_1 ) / (Si_2 / H_2 ) ) ) * ( H_1 / H_2 ) ).

But without knowing H_1 and H_2, I can't compute this. So I must have missed something.

Alternative Idea:

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. Because otherwise, how can we find the ratio of silicon? But that's an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of H in the stars is the same as the ratio of Fe, since [Fe/H] is zero in both stars.

Wait, wait. Let's think again.

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

Similarly, [Fe/H]_2 =0 → Fe_2 = Fe_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

So, the ratio of Fe_1 to Fe_2 is (H_1 / H_sun ) / ( H_2 / H_sun ) ) = H_1 / H_2.

But I don't know H_1 and H_2. Unless I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H doesn't matter because in both stars, the hydrogen is the same? No, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering the ratios of each element in terms of H, and find the ratio of Si_1 to Si_2.

Let's denote:

For Star_1:

n_Si_1 = (Si_1 / H_1 ) * H_1.

Similarly, n_Si_2 = (Si_2 / H_2 ) * H_2.

So, the ratio (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2 ) = ( (Si_1 / H_1 ) / (Si_2 / H_2 ) ) ) * ( H_1 / H_2 )

But again, without knowing H_1 and H_2, I can't proceed. So maybe there's a way to express H_1 and H_2 in terms of other variables.

Wait, because [Fe/H] is zero, Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

Similarly, Fe_2 = Fe_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

But in Star_1, (Fe_1) = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

In Star_2, (Fe_2) = Fe_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

But without knowing the Fe_1 and Fe_2, which are the same as in the Sun times H ratios, I can't find H_1 and H_2.

Wait, but perhaps in both stars, the total number of elements is the same? Or perhaps their overall composition is the same? I don't think that's given.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the [Si/H] for each star, and then find the ratio.

In Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = (Si_1 / Fe_1 ) = (Si_sun / Fe_sun ) * 10^0.3 ≈ (0.316) * 1.995 ≈ 0.63.

And [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

So, (Fe_1 / H_1 ) = Fe_sun / H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So, (Si_1 / H_1 ) = (Si_1 / Fe_1 ) * (Fe_1 / H_1 ) ) = 0.63 * 1e-4.5 ≈ 0.63 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 1.99e-5.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( (Si_1 / H_1 ) / (Si_sun / H_sun ) )

Wait, (Si_sun / H_sun ) = 1e-5.

So,

[Si/H]_1 = log10( 1.99e-5 / 1e-5 ) = log10(1.99) ≈ 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

In Star_2:

[ Mg/Si ]_2 =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 → 2.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

So, (Mg_2 / H_2 ) = Mg_sun / H_sun = 1e-5.

So, (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg_2 / H_2 ) / ( Si_2 / H_2 ) ) = (1e-5 ) / ( Si_2 / H_2 ) ) = 2.

So,

(1e-5 ) / ( Si_2 / H_2 ) ) = 2 → (Si_2 / H_2 ) = (1e-5 ) / 2 =5e-6.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log10( (5e-6 ) / (1e-5) ) = log10(0.5 )= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Now, to find the ratio of Si_1 to Si_2.

The ratio (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2 ) = ( (n_Si_1 / n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2 / n_H_2 ) ) ) * (n_H_1 / n_H_2 ).

Wait, but I don't know (n_H_1 / n_H_2 ). Hmm.

But [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Fe/H]_2 =0. So Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun ), and Fe_2 = Fe_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ).

But without knowing the actual Fe_1 and Fe_2, I can't find the ratio of H.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of H is the same as the ratio of Fe in the two stars, because [Fe/H] is zero for both.

Wait, but in that case, Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun ), Fe_2 = Fe_sun * (H_2 / H_sun ).

So, the ratio Fe_1 / Fe_2 = (H_1 / H_sun ) / ( H_2 / H_sun ) ) = H_1 / H_2.

But unless I have more info about Fe_1 and Fe_2, I can't find H_1/H_2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than needed. Let me think again.

We have [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Which means that the abundance of Si relative to H in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex, and in Star_2 it's lower by 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si_1 / n_H_1 ) = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → (n_Si_2 / n_H_2 ) = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) *10^-0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2 ) = [ (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) *10^0.3 * n_H_1 ) ] / [ (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) *10^-0.3 * n_H_2 ) ]

= [10^0.6 ] * (n_H_1 / n_H_2 )

But without knowing n_H_1/n_H_2, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. If that's the case, then the ratio is simply 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio is about 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would be this.

But why would the problem assume that H is the same in both stars? Because the [Fe/H] is zero, which relates Fe to H, but doesn't fix H.

Wait, wait. Because [Fe/H] is zero, that means Fe is at solar abundance relative to H. So, in Star_1, Fe is same as Sun's Fe relative to their own H.

But without knowing the total H in each star, I can't find the ratio of H. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore the H difference and assumes that the H is the same in both stars, leading to the ratio of 10^0.6 ≈ 4.

Given the options, option A is ~3.9.

So I think the answer is A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Definitions and Given Data
1. **Logarithmic Abundance Ratios**:
   - $[X/Y] = \log_{10}(n_X/n_Y) - \log_{10}(n_X/n_Y)_{\odot}$, where $\odot$ denotes solar values.
   - $[X/Y] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_X/n_Y}{n_X^\odot/n_Y^\odot}\right)$.

2. **Star_1**:
   - $[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3$ → $(Si/Fe)_1 = 10^{0.3} \cdot (Si/Fe)_{\odot}$.
   - $[Fe/H]_1 = 0$ → $Fe_1 = Fe_{\odot} \cdot (H_1/H_{\odot})$.

3. **Star_2**:
   - $[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3$ → $(Mg/Si)_2 = 10^{0.3} \cdot (Mg/Si)_{\odot}$.
   - $[Mg/H]_2 = 0$ → $Mg_2 = Mg_{\odot} \cdot (H_2/H_{\odot})$.

4. **Solar Values**:
   - $n_{Fe/\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{H/\odot}$.
   - $n_{Mg/\odot} = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{H/\odot}$.
   - $n_{Si/\odot} = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{H/\odot}$ (since $[Mg/Si]_{\odot} = 0$ implies $(Mg/Si)_{\odot} = 1$).

### Analysis for Star_1
1. **Silicon-to-Hydrogen Ratio**:
   Using $[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3$, we find:
   \[
   (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^{0.3} \cdot (Si/Fe)_{\odot}.
   \]
   From solar values, $(Si/Fe)_{\odot} = (n_{Si/\odot}/n_{Fe/\odot}) = (10^{-5}/10^{-4.5}) = 10^{-0.5} \approx 0.316$. Thus:
   \[
   (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^{0.3} \cdot 0.316 \approx 2 \cdot 0.316 = 0.632.
   \]

2. **Silicon-to-Hydrogen Ratio**:
   Since $[Fe/H]_1 = 0$, $Fe_1 = Fe_{\odot} \cdot (H_1/H_{\odot})$. Using $Fe_{\odot} = 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{H/\odot}$:
   \[
   (Si/H)_1 = (Si_1/H_1) = (Si/Fe)_1 \cdot (Fe/H)_1 = 0.632 \cdot 10^{-4.5} \approx 1.99 \cdot 10^{-5}.
   \]

### Analysis for Star_2
1. **Silicon-to-Hydrogen Ratio**:
   Using $[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3$, we find:
   \[
   (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^{0.3} \cdot (Mg/Si)_{\odot}.
   \]
   Since $(Mg/Si)_{\odot} = 1$, we have:
   \[
   (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^{0.3} \approx 2.
   \]

2. **Silicon-to-Hydrogen Ratio**:
   Since $[Mg/H]_2 = 0$, $Mg_2 = Mg_{\odot} \cdot (H_2/H_{\odot})$. Using $Mg_{\odot} = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{H/\odot}$:
   \[
   (Mg/H)_2 = 10^{-5}.
   \]
   From $(Mg/Si)_2 = 2$, we find:
   \[
   (Si/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_2 / 2 = (10^{-5}) / 2 = 5 \cdot 10^{-6}.
   \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{Si_1}}{n_{Si_2}} = \frac{(Si/H)_1}{(Si/H)_2} = \frac{1.99 \cdot 10^{-5}}{5 \cdot 10^{-6}} = \frac{1.99}{0.5} \approx 3.98 \approx 4.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
