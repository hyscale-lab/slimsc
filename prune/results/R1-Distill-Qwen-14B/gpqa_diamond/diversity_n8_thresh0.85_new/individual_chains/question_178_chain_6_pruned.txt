Okay, so I have this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, gamma matrices are involved here. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which I think for electromagnetism is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, but wait, wait, in this case, the ψ is a spinor, so maybe this is a different field, like a non-Abelian gauge theory or something else. But maybe that's not crucial for calculating the dimensions right now.

First, I need to figure out the mass dimension of each field and the coupling constant κ. Remember, in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian must be 4 because the action is dimensionless.

Let me recall the mass dimensions for some common fields:

- Scalar field φ: dimension 1.
- Spinor field ψ: dimension 3/2.
- Vector field A_mu: dimension 1. Because the field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so F has dimension 2 (since derivatives have dimension 1, and acting on A which is 1, so each term is 2).
- The coupling constant in the Lagrangian, like g in a term like g ψ ψ ψ, would have a dimension that makes the whole term have dimension 4. So for example, if the term is g ψ^2, and ψ is 3/2, then 3/2 * 2 = 3, so g must be 1 to make the term 4? Wait, no. Wait, no: the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term must have dimension 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a term in the Lagrangian, each field contributes its own dimension, and each derivative contributes +1. So for the term κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, I'll have to calculate the dimensions of each part.

So, ψ_bar is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. Then σ_{μν} is an object made from the gamma matrices. But since it's just a product of gamma matrices and their commutators, which are dimensionless, σ_{μν} itself must be dimensionless. So the term ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because σ doesn't contribute any dimensions.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. Each derivative in F is dimension 1. So F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each A is dimension 1 (since A is a vector field). So each term in F is ∂ (dim 1) acting on A (dim 1) → F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ terms) multiplied by F. So dimensions:

κ × [ψ]^2 × [F] = κ × (3/2 * 2) × 2.

Wait wait, no: the ψ_bar is 3/2, and ψ is 3/2. So together, ψ_bar ψ would be 3. Because 3/2 +3/2=3. Then σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so the product is 3. Then F^{μν} is 2. So the entire term is κ × 3 × 2 = 6κ. Wait, no, no. Wait, the Lagrangian term is κ * (ψ_bar σ ψ) * F. So the product is (κ) * [ψ]^2 [F].

Wait, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ_bar σ ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3 dimensions. Then F is 2. So the product is 3 * 2 =6. So the whole term is κ multiplied by 6. Since the term must have dimension 4, 6κ must be dimension 4. So κ must have dimension (4 - 6) = -2? That can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I'm making a mistake here.

No, wait. Let me clarify: each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over space-time, the action is dimensionless. So the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4.

So for the term κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, the dimension is [
