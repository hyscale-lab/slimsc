Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a certain energy level. So, the ratio of excitation is 2. I think the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels.

Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n is the number of particles, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy levels as level 1 and level 2, where level 1 is the excited state and level 2 is the lower state. So for star 1, n_1 / n_2 = 2. Let's assume that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars because it's the same element and probably similar conditions, otherwise they'd mention it. So g_i/g_j would be 1, so we can ignore that term.

So, for star 1:
n1/n2 = 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Wait, no wait. Because if E_i is higher than E_j, then ΔE is E_i - E_j, which is positive. So the exponent becomes negative. So the equation would be 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )? Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the exponential of a negative number would be less than one, but 2 is larger than one. Oh, maybe I swapped the levels. Let's think again.

Wait, n_i is the number in the higher energy level, n_j in the lower. So if in star 1, the higher level is twice as populated, we have n_i / n_j = 2 for star 1. So the equation would be 2 = exp( (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) * (g_i/g_j). Assuming g_i and g_j are same or known.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the equation right. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then the exponent is negative, leading to a value less than 1. But in star_1, n_i is twice as much as n_j, so 2 = [g_i/g_j] * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Wait, but if E_i is higher than E_j, and ΔE is E_i - E_j, which is positive. So the exponent is negative, which would mean that the ratio of n_i to n_j is less than one. But the problem says it's twice as excited for star_1, so n_i/n_j=2>1. Hmm, that's a contradiction. Unless I got the energy levels wrong.

Ah, perhaps I have the levels reversed. Maybe the situation is that E_j is lower, and E_i is higher. So maybe E_i is higher than E_j. So for the Boltzmann factor to give n_i/n_j=2, which is greater than 1, the exponent must be positive. Wait that can't be because the exponent is negative. Hmm, something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The number of atoms in a higher energy level is generally lower unless the temperature is very high. So if n_i is higher than n_j, that would mean that the thermal energy is sufficient to populate the higher level more. So maybe the ratio is n_i/n_j = 2, which is greater than 1. Let me write the equation again:

n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

Assuming that E_i > E_j (so ΔE = E_i - E_j is positive), the exponential term will be less than 1. So for the ratio to be 2, which is greater than 1, either (1) the exponential term is greater than 1 (which would require (E_i - E_j) negative, which it's not), or (2) the statistical weights g_i/g_j are greater than 2. But the problem doesn't give us any information about the statistical weights, so I think we can assume they are equal. So g_i/g_j =1.

Wait, that leads to a problem because if g_i/g_j is 1, then the equation would be 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). But the exponential of a negative number can't be 2 because it's less than 1. So that suggests I must have the energy levels reversed or made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the excitation level being twice as much, so maybe it's the lower energy level that has twice the population? No, that doesn't make sense because higher energy levels are less populated.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the higher energy level is twice as populated. So n_i = 2 n_j.

But that leads to 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), which can't be because exp is always positive, but the right-hand side would be less than 1. So that's a contradiction. Therefore,
