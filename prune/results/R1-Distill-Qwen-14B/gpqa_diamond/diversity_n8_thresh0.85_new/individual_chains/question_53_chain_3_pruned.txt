Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester oxygen, so that's a key feature.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Two are aromatic Hs. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring usually has protons, and in a di-substituted ring, depending on the substituents and their positions, the number of distinct aromatic protons can vary. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. But if they're meta, maybe more signals. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs. So maybe each substituent is in a position that causes splitting. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and another is something else.

Wait, the substituents are probably the ester and another group because there's an ester in the molecule. So the di-substituted benzene has an ester group and another group, maybe like a methyl group or something else.

The NMR also shows two signals for vinyl Hs. Vinyl is CH2=, so maybe a double bond adjacent to something. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests some coupling between the protons. Maybe it's a substituent like a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-) attached to the ring. Or perhaps it's part of an ester group, but esters usually have carbonyl and an OR group, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a substituent like a ketone group, but no, that would have different peaks.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, so maybe one of the substituents is an ester, like O-CO-OCH2CH3 or something like that. But wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl Hs. Vinyl protons are typically in the 5-6 ppm region, depending on substitution.

Additionally, there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups in the molecule. And there are no –CH2 signals, meaning no methylene groups. So the substituents should be such that any CH2 groups are either absent or not present. Maybe the substituents are a methyl group and an ester group that incorporates another methyl, like an ethyl ester? Or perhaps one substituent is a methyl group, and the other is a substituent that has another methyl, like a methoxy group attached to something else.

Wait, let's think about the structure. We have a benzene ring with two substituents. One is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R. The R could be an alkyl group. Let me think, the other substituent could be a methyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two methyl groups. So the substituents might include two methyl groups. Hmm, but wait, if it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-R), and the R has a methyl group, and the other substituent is another methyl group. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. Let's say R is an ethyl group. Then, the ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. But then, the ethyl group has two CH2 groups. But the NMR says no CH2 signals. So maybe R is a methyl group. Then the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. That's a methyl ester. So one substituent is O-CO-OCH3, and the other substituent is something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So perhaps the substituent is not just a methyl ester but another methyl group elsewhere. Let me think about this.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a methyl group and a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring. But wait, the vinyl group would have its own protons, which are the two vinyl signals. But that would require another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group and the other is an ester group. Let me think about the structure.

So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a methyl group (CH3), and the other is an ester group, say O-CO-O-R. Now, R could be something like CH2CH3. But then, R would have CH2 groups, but the NMR doesn't have CH2 signals. So R can't have a CH2 group.

Wait, but R could be a methyl group. So the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. Then, the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH3. So the benzene has an ester group (O-CO-OCH3) and a methyl group (CH3).

Wait, but the benzene ring can't have two ester groups
