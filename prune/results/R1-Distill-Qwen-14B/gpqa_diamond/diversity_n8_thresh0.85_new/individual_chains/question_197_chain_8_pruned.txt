Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I should probably look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me identify what functional groups are present and the structure of the molecule.

Looking at the IR data: I see strong peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Since I don't see any nitrogen info in the options, maybe it's an O-H group. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting that together, Compound X likely has a carbonyl group, an aromatic ring, and maybe an O-H group. Could be a carboxylic acid since the O-H would be broad, but wait, let me check the NMR.

Now the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows several signals.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is typical of an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids also have O-H protons which usually show up broad around 10-12 ppm. Hmm, but in carboxylic acids, the O-H is usually at lower ppm, like around 12, but it can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, but the IR had a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is a bit higher, so more likely an ester or ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. Wait, in this NMR, 10.5 is a singlet, maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, another possibility: sometimes an aromatic aldehyde (like benzaldehyde) has the aldehyde proton around 9.5-10 ppm, but sometimes a bit higher. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid O-H, but that's usually broader and might be a singlet. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but maybe it's deuterated and not present? Or perhaps it's an acid where the O-H is exchanged and doesn't show up. Hmm, maybe I should look for other groups.

Looking further down, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with two substituents in para positions. So the substituents are probably on a benzene ring in the para positions. The downfield doublets with 2H each suggest a para-substituted benzene. So maybe something like two substituents on the benzene, each having two protons as doublets.

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's see, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is probably a methyl group attached to an ethyl chain (like CH2CH3). The doublet at 1.4 ppm for 3H suggests a CH(CH3) group? Because a doublet for 3H is typical of a methyl group attached to a CH (like in an isopropyl group).

Wait, putting this together, perhaps there's a substituent on the benzene ring that's a branched alkyl group. Let me think about the shifts.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another CH2 or something. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group next to a branching point. So maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Wait, perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, let me think: the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3. So that's probably the end of an ethyl or propyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a branching point, maybe a CH2 connected to a CH which is connected to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (sec-butyl) group. So the structure would be something like benzene with a carbonyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions? Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that would be a benzylic propanoic acid. Structure would be benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid group at position 2. But wait, the substituents in the NMR seem to suggest a branching. The substituent on the benzene would be a (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group?

Wait, no. Let me think about each option:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the benzene has ethyl at para, and a propanoic acid at ortho. The propanoic acid would have a CH2COOH attached to the benzene. The NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 between the benzene and the COOH, but I'm not sure if that's what's observed here.

Looking at the NMR, I don't see a triplet. Instead, I see a doublet of 2H at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group and an ethyl group. Hmm.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a COOH group in para positions. Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be the carboxylic acid O-H. But wait, benzoic acid's O-H is usually around 12-13 ppm as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonated acid, but then the O-H wouldn't show up. So maybe the 10.5 is an aldehyde proton.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm for 1H. If it's an aldehyde, that fits. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but then what about the IR? The IR has a peak at 1720, which would fit an aldehyde (stretch around 1720 for the C=O). Also, the 3400-2500 region could be an aldehyde's O-H (but wait, aldehydes don't have O-H; that's more for alcohols or carboxylic acids). So maybe the IR's 3400-2500 is from an alcohol or maybe an amine, but the options don't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde and another group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it. Let me think: the IR 3400-2500 is a broad region, maybe from a hydroxyl group, but in the compound, maybe it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol, but I don't see any in the options. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the 3400-2500 is from a C-H stretch in an aldehyde or maybe an aromatic ring's C-H. But aromatic C-H stretches are usually around 3000-3100 cm-1. So the 3400-2500 region might be an O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But the options don't show an alcohol. Let me think about the NMR again.

Wait, in the NMR data, the only proton that's a singlet is the 10.5 ppm, 1H. If that's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be broad. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet, which fits. So the 10.5 ppm is the O-H of a carboxylic acid. Then, the IR's 1720 cm-1 is the C=O of the acid. The other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 are aromatic C=C.

So the molecule is a benzoic acid derivative. So options A and C are benzoic acid derivatives.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would be a propanoic acid attached to a benzene that's para-substituted with ethyl. So the benzene would have ethyl at position 4 and the propanoic acid at position 2.

But looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2. For a benzoic acid, the ring protons would be deshielded. If the substituents are in the para positions, like a COOH group and an ethyl group, then the ring would have two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That matches the NMR data.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR shifts. The 8.0 ppm would be more deshielded, so perhaps the protons next to the electron-withdrawing group (like COOH) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. So in the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d,2H) could be the protons adjacent to the COOH, and the 7.2 ppm (d,2H) could be the ones adjacent to the ethyl group.

But then, what about the other parts of the NMR? The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a multiplet of 1H. It could be a CH adjacent to a branching. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group. Let me think: if the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, no, let's think about the substituent structure. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be that CH. Then the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2 attached to another CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's a tertiary butyl. Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, let me draw this out in my mind. The substituent on the benzene is a group that has a CH that is connected to a CH2 and a CH2CH3. So perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR signals would be as follows: the CH2 next to the benzene (the -CH2-) would be at around Î´ 2.9-3.0 as a multiplet (maybe 1H?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2CH3
