Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an ester functional group present. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester oxygen, so the formula will have an O2 maybe? Wait, let me think: an ester group is R-O-CO-O-R, no, wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the structure is R-O-CO-R', which contributes two oxygen atoms. So the molecular formula will have at least two oxygen atoms.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me break down the peaks:

- Two signals for aromatic H. So, the substituents on the benzene ring must be in such a way that there are two types of aromatic protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that create symmetry. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, but wait, in that case, maybe only one peak for aromatic H. Hmm, but here there are two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in meta positions or ortho, but wait, if they're di-substituted on a benzene ring, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, or para. Now, in a para-substituted case, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be in sets. Wait, if it's para, then the ring would have two equivalent sets of protons. Let me think: for example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3, maybe that gives two different sets of H? No, wait para would be positions 1 and 4, perhaps. Let me think again. If the substituents are para, like two groups on opposite ends, then the aromatic ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. But wait, the number of signals would depend on the substituents. For example, if the substituents are both strong de-shielding groups, like nitro groups, but in this case, it's an ester, so maybe the substituents are two ester groups attached to the ring. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and another group, say a methoxy group or something else. No, wait, the question says the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. Both could be ester groups? Hmm, but esters are typically R-O-CO-R', so for them to be substituents on the ring, perhaps they are attached as O-CO-O-R groups? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and another is something else, like a methyl group or another ester group.

Wait, but the NMR also shows signals for vinyl H. So there are vinyl protons, which suggests that there's a double bond somewhere in the molecule. Esters don't have double bonds, but maybe the substituents contain a double bond.

So, let's think of the substituents. One substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent could be a vinyl group,
