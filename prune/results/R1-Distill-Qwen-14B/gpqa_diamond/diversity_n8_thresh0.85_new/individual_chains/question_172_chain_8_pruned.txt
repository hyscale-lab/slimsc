Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is where the star emits most of its light, and LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual laws apply there.

I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are because higher temperatures mean more thermal energy. So if star_1 has twice as many excited iron atoms, it must be hotter than star_2.

Wait, but how does the excitation relate to temperature? Oh, right, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The distribution tells us the number of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that down. The energy difference Î”E = E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J, and since star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2, the ratio N1/N2 is 2. But wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So for the same transition, N_upper / N_lower is higher in star_1. So the ratio is 2.

But wait, I think the ratio N1/N2 is N_upper / N_lower for each star. So for star 1, N_upper_1 / N_lower_1 = 2 times (N_upper_2 / N_lower_2). Or maybe N_upper_1 / N_upper_2 = 2? Wait, no. Let me think.

The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. I think it refers to the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state. So for each star, the excitation level is the ratio of excited atoms to non-excited ones. So, for star_1, that ratio is twice as high as star_2's.

Wait no, the
