Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and some properties. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The matrices given are W, X, Y, and Z. I need to evaluate each option and see which statement is correct.

Let me start by understanding each matrix.

Matrix W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

That looks like a permutation matrix. It swaps the basis vectors, right? Like, if you have a vector (a, b, c), multiplying by W would give (c, b, a). So, it's orthogonal, I think. Because permutation matrices are orthogonal. Their inverses are their transposes. So W transpose is the same as W inverse.

Matrix X is:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1  -i

Hmm, this one has complex entries. I remember that for an observable, the matrix must be Hermitian. Hermitian means that the matrix equals its conjugate transpose. Let me check if X is Hermitian.

The conjugate transpose of X would be taking the transpose and conjugating each element. So transpose of X is:

i 1 2i
-1 0 -1
2i 1 -i

Wait, no, let's transpose X properly.

Original X rows:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row3: 2i, -1, -i

Transposing X:

Column 1 becomes row 1: i,1,2i
Column 2 becomes row 2: -1,0,-1
Column 3 becomes row3: 2i,1,-i

Now, take the complex conjugate of each element:

So conjugate of i is -i, 1 stays 1. So first row becomes: -i, 1, -2i (since 2i conjugate is -2i?)
Wait, wait. Let's do each element.

Conjugate of i is -i. Conjugate of -1 is -1. Conjugate of 2i is -2i.

Wait, no. Wait, the conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So for i, it's 0 + 1i → 0 -1i → -i.

So the conjugate transpose of X would be:

Row1: -i, 1, -2i
Row2: -1,0,-1
Row3: 2i,1, -i

Compare that to X:

X is:
Row1: i, -1, 2i
Row2:1, 0, 1
Row3:2i, -1, -i

So, clearly, X's conjugate transpose is not equal to X. For example, the (1,1) element in conjugate transpose is -i, but in X it's i. So X is not Hermitian. So X is not an observable. Because observables must be Hermitian.

Matrix Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

This looks symmetric. Because it's equal to its transpose. So Y is a real symmetric matrix, which is Hermitian as well, since all elements are real. So Y is Hermitian, so it can be an observable. But I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Matrix Z is:
3      2i     5
-2i    -2    -4i
5      4i     4

I need to check if Z is Hermitian. So compute the conjugate transpose of Z.

Original Z: rows are [3, 2i,5], [-2i, -2, -4i], [5,4i,4].

Transposing Z:

Column 1 becomes row1: 3, -2i,5
Column 2: 2i, -2,4i
Column3:5, -4i,4

Now, take the complex conjugate of each element:

Conjugate of 3 is 3.

-2i → 2i.

5 →5.

Similarly, 2i → -2i, -2 →-2, 4i →-4i.

So the conjugate transpose of Z is:

Row1: 3, -2i,5
Row2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row3:5,4i,4

Wait, let me compute each element:

Conjugate of -2i is 2i, but I think I messed up. Wait, no, wait: Original Z's transpose is:

Row1:3, -2i,5

Row2:2i, -2,4i

Row3:5, -4i,4

Wait, no, transpose is:

row1 becomes column1: 3, -2i,5

row2 becomes column2: 2i, -2,4i

row3 becomes column3:5, -4i,4.

Now, taking the complex conjugate:

so the (1,2) element was -2i, conjugate is 2i.

(2,1) element is 2i → now it's -2i.

Wait, perhaps I should write it step by step.

Conjugate of each element in the transposed matrix:

Row1:3 →3, -2i →2i,5→5.

Row2:2i→-2i, -2→-2,4i→-4i.

Row3:5→5, -4i→4i,4→4.

So the conjugate transpose is:

3   2i   5

-2i -2  -4i

5   4i   4

Now compare to original Z:

Original Z has row1:3, 2i,5.

Row2:-2i, -2,-4i.

Row3:5,4i,4.

So, the conjugate transpose of Z is:

3   2i   5

-2i -2  -4i

5   4i   4

Which is exactly the same as Z. So Z is Hermitian. So Z is an observable.

Wait, but in option C, it says Z and X are observables. But X is not Hermitian, as we saw earlier. So option C is incorrect because X is not Hermitian, so it can't be an observable.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when checking X for Hermiticity. Let me double-check.

Matrix X is:

i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1  -i

Conjugate transpose would be the transpose with each element conjugated.

Transposing X:

Row1: i, 1, 2i

Row2: -1, 0, -1

Row3: 2i, 1, -i

Wait, no. Wait, the transpose of X is:

After transpose:

Row1: i, 1, 2i

Row2: -1,0,-1

Row3: 2i,1,-i

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me
