Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up in some mice. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the question describes a bicistronic vector with two ORFs: the ligand and the receptor. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

I remember that bicistronic constructs use internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or other mechanisms to allow for the expression of two proteins from a single mRNA. Here, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. So the ligand would be expressed first, followed by the receptor, since the IRES allows for translation after the first ORF.

But wait, the vector has stop cassettes. The loxP-stop-loxP is before mCherry, and lox2272-stop-lox2272 is before eGFP. So without the appropriate Cre recombinase, these stop cassettes prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP. Because Cre can recognize lox sites and delete the intervening sequences.

Now, the setup involves mice that are homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They're crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. I think SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so maybe the Cre is supposed to be active there. SOX10-Cre would cause recombination, deleting the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

They look for green signal, which comes from eGFP on the receptor construct. But they don't see it. So why isn't eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells. But I'm not sure how this would affect expression in the construct. The presence of paracrine signaling doesn't directly explain why the fluorescent markers aren't showing up. Maybe if the ligand is secreted, but the construct's expression is about the fusion proteins, not their function.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking correctly, maybe it doesn't reach the cell surface. But the question describes the expression after transfection in primary astrocytes, and the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So in the transfection, the proteins are being expressed, but when they're in the mouse, maybe eGFP isn't being made. Or maybe in the mouse model, but not in the transfected cells. Wait, the Western blot was after transfection, which showed expression. So in the mouse, why isn't it showing up?

Wait, no. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They were crossed with SOX10-Cre. So in the mouse, the Cre would have recombined the lox sites. Let me think about which lox sites. The ligand has loxP, and the receptor has lox2272. SOX10-Cre is a Cre line that's active in neural crest cells, but does it target specific lox sites? I'm not sure about the type of lox sites here. Oh wait, the ligand's stop cassette is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. Cre from the SOX10-Cre would recognize loxP sites. So when the Cre is expressed, it would delete the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which is a different variant. I think lox2272 is a variant that can work with wild-type Cre but isn't recognized by some other variants. Alternatively, maybe Cre can't act on lox2272. Or perhaps the Cre in the SOX10-Cre line can't recognize lox2272. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the Cre line isn't active in the right cells. So if the Cre isn't expressed where the construct is active, then the stop cassettes aren't removed, and the eGFP isn't expressed. But the problem says they crossed to SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so perhaps the Cre is active there. But if the vector is in the neural crest cells, then the stop cassettes would be removed, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, but the question says that in the mouse, the offspring are bred to be homozygous for the construct. So when they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous line, the Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells. So the construct would be present in all cells, but Cre is active in neural crest cells, causing the stop cassettes to be removed in those cells. So in neural crest cells, mCherry and eGFP should be expressed. But in other cells, perhaps the Cre isn't active, so the stop cassettes remain, preventing fluorescence.

But they're using a confocal microscope to visualize the fluorescent signal. If the Cre isn't active in the cells they're looking at, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why wouldn't they see any green signal? Maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed, or perhaps the construct isn't expressed in the cells where Cre is active.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot showed that the ligand and receptor are expressed, but the fluorescent proteins aren't. Wait, the Western blot was done on the transfected primary astrocytes. Hmm, but in the mouse, the expression would be under the endogenous promoters. Wait, no, the construct's ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe the ligand is expressed everywhere.

But the problem states that after the offspring are born, they are visualized under the confocal. They didn't see a green signal. So in the mice, the eGFP isn't being expressed.

What could prevent eGFP expression? The construct requires that the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is removed by Cre. If the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells where the receptor is expressed.

Wait, the lox sites matter. LoxP is 34 bp, and lox2272 is a variant. Cre can recognize both, but sometimes lox2272 is used in combination with other lox variants to prevent recombination in the presence of wild-type Cre. For example, in some systems, lox2272 is used with a mutant Cre to allow for dual recombination. But if the Cre is wild-type, it can still recognize lox2272. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the Cre isn't present in the mice. Wait, no, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the mice should have the Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, Cre is expressed, causing recombination.

But what if the stop cassette for the receptor is lox2272, and the Cre in the mice isn't active? Or maybe the Cre can't recognize lox2272. Alternatively, perhaps the construct is in a region where the Cre can't access the lox sites.

Another possibility is the reading frame. If the stop cassette isn't removed correctly, the reading frame for the receptor-eGFP might be wrong. So when Cre deletes the stop cassette, if the ORF isn't correctly spliced, the eGFP might not be in frame, leading to no fluorescent protein. But the stop cassette is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So if the stop is removed, the receptor is followed by eGFP, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed correctly.

Looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that after the stop is removed, the eGFP is not properly expressed, so no fluorescent signal. But why would that happen? Because the stop cassette includes lox sites and a stop codon. If the Cre deletes the stop cassette, the receptor is directly followed by eGFP. If the cloning was done correctly, they should be in frame. But if the cloning caused a frameshift, that's a problem. Alternatively, the presence of the stop cassette may have introduced a stop codon in the same frame as the receptor.

Wait, but the stop cassette is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP. If the frames are correct, that's fine. But if the stop cassette was inserted in a way that the reading frame is disrupted, then the eGFP won't be properly expressed. So if the stop cassette was inserted without maintaining the frame, then after deletion, the eGFP might not be in frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

So the problem could be that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed. That would explain the lack of green signal.

Another possibility is option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive. The receptor is under the control of an IRES, which should allow for internal ribosome entry. So if the enhancer is missing, the expression would be lower, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Alternatively, if the Cre isn't active, then the stop cassettes remain. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should have Cre active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stop cassettes should be removed, leading to mCherry and eGFP expression. If no green signal, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells being visualized.

Wait, but the question says the offspring are crossed to SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should be active in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, the construct would be active, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But when they look for eGFP in the confocal, they don't see it. So perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed in the intended cells.

Alternatively, maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. Suppose the lox2272 can't be recognized by the Cre, so the stop cassette isn't removed. Then the eGFP isn't expressed. But I thought that Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272.

Wait, another point: the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand first, then the receptor. The ligand is CBA-driven, and the receptor is IRES-driven. The stop cassettes are after each. The ligand has a loxP-stop in front of mCherry. The receptor has lox2272-stop in front of eGFP. So after Cre recombination, ligand and mCherry would be expressed together, and receptor and eGFP would be expressed only if the lox2272 is recognized.

Wait, but the Cre is from the SOX10-Cre line. SOX10-Cre is a transgenic line where Cre is under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in neural crest cells, Cre is expressed. If the Cre can recognize lox2272, then the stop cassette before eGFP would be removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But perhaps the issue is that the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Or maybe the vector's lox2272 is a different variant that isn't recognized by the Cre used here. I think lox2272 is a variant that can be recognized by wild-type Cre, but perhaps the construct uses a different version.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being properly removed. If the lox2272 isn't correctly recognized, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed, but in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't. But the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes, not the mouse. So
