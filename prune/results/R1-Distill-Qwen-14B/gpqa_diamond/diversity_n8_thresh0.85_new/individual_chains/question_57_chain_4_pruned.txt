Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles scatter elastically, the scattering amplitude plays a big role in determining how they scatter. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and we're supposed to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So I guess only these five contribute.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by some formula involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the general form is f(θ) = (1/(k i)) Σ (a_l (2l+1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i δ_l}), where k is the wave number, a_l is the amplitude, and P_l are Legendre polynomials. But wait, for the imaginary part along the beam direction, what does that imply about θ? Along the incident beam direction would be θ=0°, right? Because the beam is moving along a certain direction, and scattering at 0° would be straight ahead.

Wait, let me think. When θ is 0°, cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1. So each term becomes (a_l (2l+1) ) * e^{i δ_l}.

But wait, the imaginary part of f(θ) would then be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term. So for each term, the imaginary part is (a_l (2l+1)) * sin(δ_l). Because e^{iφ} has imaginary part sinφ.

Wait, but what's a_l? Oh, right. The relation between the phase shift δ_l and a_l is given by a_l = (k f_l ), where f_l is the l-th partial wave amplitude. But wait, I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is f(θ) = sum [ ( (2l+1) (a_l) P_l(cosθ) ) e^{i δ_l} ] / (k i) ), right? So each term is (2l+1) a_l P_l(cosθ) e^{i δ_l} all over (k i).

Hmm, and I'm looking for the imaginary part of f(theta) at theta=0. So let's compute Im[f(0)].

Since P_l(1) is 1 for all l, the expression simplifies to f(θ=0) = [ sum_{l=0}^4 ( (2l+1) a_l ) e^{i δ_l} ] / (k i).

To find the imaginary part, let's note that 1/(k i) is -i/(k). So when we take the imaginary part, we have:

Im[f(0)] = Im[ (sum terms) * (-i/k) ].

Let me break this down. The sum is sum [ (2l+1) a_l e^{i δ_l} ].

Wait, a_l is related to δ_l: I think a_l = (k f_l ), but the exact relation might be a_l = ( (u) (1/(2m))^{1/2} ) ), but maybe that's not necessary here. Wait
