Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So the question is about a genetic construct and why a green signal isn't showing up in the mice. Hmm. 

First, let me break down what's given. So we have a ligand and a receptor. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets forming a binding site. Not sure if the structure details matter here, but maybe the expression construct does.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the vector has both ligand and receptor under their own promoters? Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh, I remember IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive expression of the downstream gene without a separate promoter. So the CBA promoter is for the ligand, and the IRES is for the receptor.

Then, between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop with loxP. And between receptor and eGFP is a stop with lox2272. So the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it will recombine the lox sites, removing the stops. So if Cre is active, the ligand and mCherry will be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP as well.

Wait, but the setup says the ligand is at 5' with mCherry, so the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So if the stop is in a loxP cassette, then Cre would remove that stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed, and the mCherry as a fusion? Or perhaps the ligand is under a promoter, and mCherry is downstream but under a separate promoter? Or maybe the ligand is in frame with mCherry, but the stop is preventing that. Hmm, maybe it's a fusion construct. So when the stop is removed, ligand and mCherry are co-expressed as a single protein? Or maybe ligand is separate, but the stop is just to prevent expression of mCherry unless Cre is there.

Wait, maybe it's a dual expression system. The vector is designed so that without Cre, the ligand is not expressed because of the stop, but the receptor is under IRES. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So it can express two proteins from one transcript. The first gene is ligand, under CBA promoter, then after the ORF, a stop with loxP. Then the second gene is the receptor, which is under IRES. So, the IRES would drive the translation of the receptor. But wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, then the IRES would drive the receptor.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about bicistronic vectors. They often have a promoter, then the first ORF, then an IRES, then the second ORF. So the same mRNA is used, with the IRES allowing the second ORF to be translated. So in this case, the ligand is under CBA promoter, then after the ORF, there's a stop with loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor.

Wait, no, the problem says the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP. So perhaps the ligand is ligand-mCherry, and the receptor is receptor-eGFP.

But the stops are in between. For the ligand, between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, allowing lig
