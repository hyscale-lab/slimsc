Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about reaction mechanisms and then determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. Hmm, symmetry groups—I remember those are related to the shapes of molecules and their point groups.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the stoichiometry here is A + 8 B → C. What's a reaction where one solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio? I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else. Wait, sulfur is bright red as a solid, but when it reacts with something, maybe it forms a compound. Another thought: maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen, but 8 equivalents seems high.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is something like sodium dichromate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal. Wait, another angle: the product C reacts with D and with water. Let's look at that.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E. E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, what's a dangerous product that forms from such reactions? Maybe something like chlorine gas? Wait, no, because D is a gas. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene or something else. Or perhaps E is a strong acid, but that's when C reacts with water.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. Strong and weak. For example, if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. Let me think: perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Wait, if C is something like sodium dichromate, then when it reacts with water, maybe it forms H2SO4 and H2CrO4. But wait, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: when a compound reacts with water to produce two acids, perhaps it's a salt of two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite, then it would produce a strong acid (like H2SO3 is weak, but maybe I'm mixing it up). Alternatively, if C is a nitrate, maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me think about the fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. H is a solvent, so maybe something like water, but that's H2O. Or perhaps another common solvent like ethanol, but more likely something like HCl or another acid, but wait, the products are H, which is a solvent. So maybe H is something like ethanol (but that's not a gas), or maybe H is something like an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps B and D are gases that form a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, B is a gas reacting with D, a gas, in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, maybe diethyl ether, but those are liquids. So perhaps B and D are gases that combine to form a liquid solvent. For example, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, but that would form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O, but that's a liquid. Oh, wait, D is a gas. 

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. Wait, but NH3 is a gas, HCl is a gas. When they react 1:1, they form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a liquid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O, but then B would have to be a gas that reacts with H2O in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about common solvent reactions.

Wait, another thought: if B is H2S and D is Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. No, B is a gas, so H2O is a liquid under standard conditions. Hmm.

Let me try to think of what product E could be. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a gas like phosgene (CO
