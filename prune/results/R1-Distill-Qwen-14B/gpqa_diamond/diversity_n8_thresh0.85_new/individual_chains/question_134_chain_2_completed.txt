Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the solutions involved are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve an acid reacting with a base to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base.

Wait, but wait. In this case, there are three solutions, so I might need to consider all the reactions happening here. Or maybe figure out which of them are reacting with each other. Let me think: HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So perhaps the acids will react with the base.

But wait, maybe I should calculate the moles of each component first. Because the neutralization reactions would depend on the moles available.

Right, to find the enthalpy change, I need to determine which reactions are occurring and how many moles of each are reacting.

Let's get the moles of each substance.

First, HCl. The volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.

Next, H2SO4. Volume is 300 mL (0.3 L) and 0.3 M. So 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), wait no, actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, no. H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation. Wait, no, actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid but the second dissociation is weak. Wait, no, wait. Wait, correction: Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong acid in its first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- no, wait, actually, no. Wait, wait. Let's correct this. H2SO4 is a strong acid; it fully dissociates into H+ and HSO4^- in the first step. Then HSO4^- is a weak acid, so it partially dissociates into H+ and SO4^2-.

So for the purpose of neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 can provide 2 moles of H+? Or is it just one? Hmm. Wait, when H2SO4 is a strong acid, it dissociates completely the first time, so H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, no. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait no, no, wait. No, that's incorrect. Actually, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the first H+ is completely ionized, and the second is only partially.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For H2SO4 in solution: the first H+ is fully dissociated, so one mole of H2SO4 gives one mole of H+ (since it's a strong acid), but then the HSO4^- can donate another H+ but not completely. So in a neutralization reaction, the first H+ would react with the OH- from the base, and the second H+ (if any) would also react, but the availability depends on the strength.

Wait, but in neutralization reactions, typically, each mole of H2SO4 would provide two moles of H+ because the first is strong and the second is weak but still can contribute. Or perhaps not? Maybe I should think about the equivalents for each acid and base.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the equivalents of H+ from the acids and the equivalents of OH- from the base.

So, for HCl: it's a strong acid. Each mole gives one mole of H+. So 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 equivalents H+.

H2SO4: it's diprotic. Each mole can provide two H+ ions, but the second is only weakly acidic. So for neutralization purposes, perhaps both are available? Or does the second H+ not react because it's weak? Hmm.

Alternatively, when a diprotic acid is mixed with a base, the first H+ will neutralize completely, and the second may not, depending on the strength. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in this context, the problem assumes that all H+ ions from the acid are available for neutralization.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So, perhaps the reaction is between the H+ from the acids and the OH- from the base.

So let's calculate the equivalents of H+ from both acids and the equivalents of OH- from the base.

First, HCl: 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 equivalents H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles H2SO4 → each can release 2 H+? So 0.18 equivalents H+? Wait, but wait. No, because the first H+ is strong, the second may not dissociate completely. Hmm, but in neutralization, are we considering all possible H+ available?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ are available. Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization is considering only the strong H+.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that each H2SO4 gives one mole of H+ for neutralization because the second H+ is weak. Or wait, in the presence of a strong base like Ba(OH)2, maybe the second H+ also reacts. Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it will deprotonate as much as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and treating H2SO4 as a strong acid, providing two H+ per molecule. So let's proceed with that for now.

So, for H2SO4: 0.09 moles × 2 = 0.18 equivalents H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L, 0.5 M → 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 equivalents OH-.

Wait, so total H+ from acids: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 equivalents.

Total OH- from base: 0.2 equivalents.

So, which is in excess? H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent, and all OH- will react with H+.

So the neutralization reaction will involve 0.2 moles of OH- reacting with 0.2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait. Neutralization would produce water: H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

So the amount of H+ used is 0.2 moles, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08).

But wait, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So which one reacts first?

In general, the stronger acid will donate H+ first. HCl is a stronger acid than H2SO4's second dissociation. So perhaps the H+ from HCl and H2SO4's first dissociation will react first.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, so it's effectively as strong as HCl. HCl is a strong acid with a very high dissociation constant, as is the first H+ of H2SO4.

So, in a mixture, the H+ from both would react with OH-.

So, in this case, the OH- is 0.2 moles. So 0.2 moles of H+ (from either acid) will react with it.

So, the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, which comes from HCl and H2SO4.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization for each H+ comes into play. Wait, but the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. But wait, sometimes it's given per mole of H+ or per mole of acid.

Wait, when the problem refers to enthalpy of neutralization, it's typically the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. For strong acids and bases, this is around -57 kJ per mole of acid.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when it neutralizes, each mole of H2SO4 would release 2 × 57 kJ = 114 kJ? Or is it 57 per mole of H+?

Wait, I think the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+.

So, each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ.

So, in this problem, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check: HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole releases 1 mole H+. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole releases 2 H+. But in neutralization, each H+ contributes to the enthalpy change.

So if you have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, you get 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but wait. The units are in kJ for option D, others are kcal.

Wait, the options are a mix of kJ and kcal. Hmm, so I need to check the units.

The question asks for enthalpy of neutralization, but the options have both kcal and kJ. Wait, but the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually in kJ per mole.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem gives the concentrations in M and mL, but then asks for the enthalpy. So the calculation is based on the moles of H+ neutralized.

Wait, but I should also consider if any of the acids or base are in excess, and if any reactions involve more than just H+ and OH-.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, the total H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles. From H2SO4, each mole contributes 2 H+, so 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- is 0.2 moles, H+ is 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles, which doesn't react because there's no more OH-.

So the reaction is for 0.2 moles of H+.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (ΔH per mole H+).

Assuming ΔH is -57 kJ per mole H+ (as in the standard value for strong acid-base reactions), so 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → about -11.4 kJ is around 2.7 kcal because 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ. Wait, 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72. So 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal. But the enthalpy is negative, so option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.7 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused with the units. Let me double-check the unit conversions.

If the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, then in kcal that's -11.4 / 4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -11.4 kJ, which is equivalent to approximately -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options:

Option A is -2.72 kcal.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait another moment. The problem says "enthalpy of neutralization"—which usually refers to the enthalpy change per mole of reaction as written. For HCl, the reaction is HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O, ΔH ≈ -57 kJ/mol. But for H2SO4, the reaction would be H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O, ΔH ≈ -114 kJ/mol.

Wait, but in our case, the base is Ba(OH)2, which is different. So the reaction would be: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so let's write the neutralization reaction.

HCl and Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, but since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it will donate OH- ions, and HCl will donate H+.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions. So for each mole of HCl, which provides one H+, we need one mole of OH- to neutralize. So for HCl:

H+ (from HCl) + OH- → H2O.

Each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ.

Similarly, for H2SO4, each H+ contributes -57 kJ.

So back to the original problem, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles, so 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have both kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ → 2.72 kcal ×4.184≈11.42 kJ). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16 kJ, which is more negative than our calculated value.

Wait, but wait. Could I have made a mistake in the moles calculation?

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So reaction is 0.2 moles H+ neutralized.

So 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is approximately -11.4 kJ, which is option D if that's the correct unit. But wait, option D says -16.0 kJ, which is different. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for HCl, the neutralization reaction is HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O, ΔH = -57 kJ/mol.

Similarly, for H2SO4, neutralization with a base would release 2 × 57 = 114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But in our case, the base is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. So each mole of H2SO4 would react with one mole of Ba(OH)2, but since Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-, how does that affect the reaction?

Wait, let me think about the stoichiometry. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but let's balance this.

H2SO4 has 2 H+; Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH-.

So the reaction would be: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, let's count the H and O:

Left side: H2SO4 has 2 H, Ba(OH)2 has 2 H (from 2 OH-). So total H: 4 H.

On the right, 2 H2O gives 4 H. So that balances.

O: H2SO4 has 4 O, Ba(OH)2 has 2 O (from 2 OH-), so 6 O on the left.

On the right: BaSO4 has 4 O, and 2 H2O has 2×O=2 O. So total O: 6. So it's balanced.

So the reaction uses 1 mole H2SO4 and 1 mole Ba(OH)2, producing 1 mole BaSO4 and 2 moles H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be the sum of the neutralization of both H+ from H2SO4 with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Since each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-, they react in a 1:1 ratio.

The enthalpy for this reaction would be: 2 × (-57 kJ) = -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, but wait, because each mole of H2SO4 contributes two H+ neutralizing, each of which releases 57 kJ. So 2 × 57 = 114 kJ released, so ΔH is -114 kJ.

Similarly, for HCl, each mole releases 57 kJ.

So maybe I need to calculate the moles of each acid that actually reacted with the base.

Wait, but in this problem, the base is limited. So let's see:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1 moles.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So all OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

So, which H+ comes first? HCl is a strong acid; its H+ is fully available. So the OH- will first react with H+ from HCl, then from H2SO4.

But wait, no, in a mixture, H+ comes from all sources and reacts with OH-.

So regardless of the source, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

So regardless, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, which could consist of some from HCl and some from H2SO4.

But the enthalpy is per mole of H+.

So 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

So -11.4 kJ is the enthalpy change.

Looking at the options:

D is -16.0 kJ, which is more negative than our value. So perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, H2SO4 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. If each provides 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles H+.

HCl is 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using 0.2 moles H+.

So 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ released, so ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. But wait, perhaps the problem considers both H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 as strong, and the reaction is more exothermic.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is considered as -114 kJ per mole (since two H+ are neutralized), and HCl as -57 kJ per mole.

But in this case, the OH- can only handle 0.2 H+.

So the total would be 0.2 ×57 = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, that's the same as before.

But looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, another check:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles.

Wait, so HCl is 0.1, H2SO4 0.09, Ba(OH)2 0.1.

H+ from HCl: 0.1.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 × 2 = 0.18.

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH-: 0.1 × 2 = 0.2.

So yes, 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized.

So 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.7 kJ, way too big.

Wait, another possible mistake: maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

For example, HCl contributes one H+ per mole, so per mole of HCl, 57 kJ.

H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole, so per mole, 114 kJ.

But in this case, not all of the H2SO4 may react, depending on the OH- available.

Wait, let's think about the limiting reagent.

The available H+ is 0.28 moles.

The available OH- is 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 H+.

So the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

Which H+ reacts first? HCl is a stronger acid than the second H+ of H2SO4. So the HCl's H+ will react first.

So H+ from HCl: 0.1 moles. That's more than 0.2? No, wait.

Wait, we have 0.2 moles of OH-.

HCl has 0.1 H+. So the OH- will first neutralize all 0.1 H+ from HCl, leaving 0.1 moles of OH-.

Then the remaining OH- (0.1 moles) will neutralize H+ from H2SO4.

Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+.

So 0.1 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.1 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Which is 0.05 moles of H2SO4.

Because each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so moles of H2SO4 needed to provide 0.1 H+ is 0.05.

So, the H2SO4 that reacts is 0.05 moles.

So the total enthalpy is:

HCl: 0.1 moles × (-57 kJ) = -5.7 kJ.

H2SO4: 0.05 moles × (-114 kJ) = -5.7 kJ.

Wait, why -114? Because each mole of H2SO4 releases 114 kJ (2 × 57) when completely neutralized.

So for 0.05 moles, it's 0.05 × 114 = 5.7 kJ released.

So total is -5.7 + (-5.7) = -11.4 kJ.

Same result as before.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, D says -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

But wait, let's check the options again.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ). 11.4 /4.184 is approximately 2.72.

So -11.4 kJ is the same as -2.72 kcal.

Looking back, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that would be the correct answer in terms of kcal.

But why would the answer be presented in kcal? Because the problem didn't specify the units, but the options have both.

Wait, the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization." Typically, the enthalpy is given in kJ per mole in modern practice, but sometimes in kcal.

So in this case, if the problem expects the answer in kcal, then option A is the choice.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem lists the options as:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So the correct value is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches our value.

But wait, why is option B even there? Because if I miscalculate and think in terms of moles of acid, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 only, as they are both strong, leading to a more exothermic reaction.

Wait, let's calculate the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The mole ratio is 1:1.

So moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent, since 0.09 < 0.1.

So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be 0.09 × (-114 kJ) = -10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles.

Which is 0.01 × 2 = 0.02 moles of OH-.

Now, HCl is 0.1 moles H+.

So the remaining OH- (0.02 moles) will react with H+ from HCl.

So moles of HCl reacting: 0.02.

Entthalpy change from HCl: 0.02 × (-57 kJ) = -1.14 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -10.26 + (-1.14) = -11.4 kJ.

Again, same result.

So the total enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes 0.1 moles of H⁺.
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.  
     H₂SO₄ is diprotic, so it contributes 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of H⁺.
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles.  
     Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles of OH⁻.

2. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - Total H⁺ available = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H₂SO₄) = 0.28 moles.  
   - Total OH⁻ available = 0.2 moles.  
   - Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, all 0.2 moles of OH⁻ will react with 0.2 moles of H⁺.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately **-57 kJ per mole of H⁺**.  
   - Total enthalpy change = 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.  
   - Converting to kcal:  
     1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so -11.4 kJ ≈ -2.72 kcal.

4. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of -2.72 kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it is far too large.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value of -11.4 kJ.

Thus, the correct answer is **-2.72 kcal**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
