Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. The vacuum pumps are creating an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment—like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of gas molecules to improve the electron microscopy because fewer gas particles mean less scattering of electrons, right?

But even after all that pumping, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them. So Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

Wait, the question says Mike found that when he started the electron beam, the mean free path changed from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature stayed the same. So why would the mean free path change? Hmm.

I remember that the mean free path (λ) is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Oh wait, but when the pressure is low, the mean free path is longer. Because P is inversely proportional to λ. So lower pressure means higher λ.

Wait, but in this case, the sample's in an ultra-high vacuum, so P is already very low. But when the electron beam is on, maybe something changes. Oh, wait—could the electron beam be affecting the gas molecules? Like, maybe it's heating the gas? But the question says the temperature remained the same. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the electrons are interacting with the gas molecules, causing them to move or change state. Oh, but wait—the gas is at the same temperature. Hmm. Or perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize. If they ionize, they might become charged, which would cause them to be accelerated or repelled by the beam's electric field. That could change their behavior.

Wait, if the gas molecules are ionized, they'd have an electric charge. That would affect how they move in the electron microscope. So, the mean free path depends on the effective cross-section for collisions. If the gas molecules are now charged, they might interact more with each other or with other surfaces. Or maybe they're more likely to stick to the walls of the compartment because of their charge, effectively reducing the number of particles in the gas phase.

Wait, but wait. When gas particles are ionized, their behavior changes. They might form ions that could be influenced by electric fields. But in the electron beam, the electrons would have a high energy. So maybe the ionized gas particles (ions) would be repelled or attracted by the beam, causing them to be removed from the system or to stick to other surfaces. That would effectively reduce the number of gas molecules in the compartment, because some of them are being removed.

If the number of gas molecules decreases, the pressure P would decrease too, because pressure is proportional to the number of particles (n), so P = nkT/V. Lower P would mean a longer mean free path. So λ is inversely proportional to P.
