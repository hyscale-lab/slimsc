Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and how their interaction affects development. The setup involves creating a bicistronic vector with specific promoters and stop cassettes. Then, they use this in mice and see if a fluorescent signal appears, but it doesn't. The options given are possible reasons why.

First, let me understand the vector setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so it should drive expression of the ligand regardless of tissue or cell type. The receptor is under the IRES element, which I remember is an internal ribosome entry site. IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a second promoter. So the receptor's expression would depend on the efficiency of the IRES in driving its translation after the ligand's.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272. I think these are different loxP sites so that Cre can excise the stops in specific tissues. So, when Cre is present, it would recognize either the loxP or lox2272 sites and delete the stop cassette, allowing the downstream fluorescent marker (mCherry for ligand, eGFP for receptor) to be expressed.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and tested expression by Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which is a loading control. But when they crossed the homozygous mice with SOX10-Cre, the offspring didn't show a green signal under the confocal. Since the green is from eGFP, it suggests the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or tagged properly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the vector is designed for the same cell to express both ligand and receptor. So this might not explain why the eGFP isn't showing. Moreover, the question is about expression in the construct, not the interaction.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That could prevent it from being on the cell surface, thus not fluorescent. If the GFP is not expressed, maybe due to some protein trafficking issue. But in the Western blot, they'd check the total proteins. If the protein is made but stuck, the blot might show it. But the question says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins, so perhaps the blot detects the presence. Wait, the Western blot used total proteins. So if the construct is expressed, the blot should pick it up. But the question only says "a signal proportional to the actin loading." Maybe the blot is just confirming loading, not the actual expression levels. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: Missing enhancer for ligand and receptor expression. The promoter is CBA for ligand, which is strong. The receptor uses the IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. If the enhancer is missing, the ligand might not be expressed. But then why would the eGFP not show? The question says the mouse is homozygous for the construct. Maybe the enhancer is needed for both, but if the CBA promoter is strong, perhaps the ligand is expressed, but the receptor's expression depends on the IRES and the presence of Cre.

Wait, the construct is in the mice, and they're crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. Using SOX10-Cre would mean that Cre is expressed in neural crest derivatives, like the cells in question. The Cre would excise the stop cassettes. So the ligand (mCherry) and receptor (eGFP) should be expressed in neural crest cells, but in the question, the eGFP isn't showing.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The ligand is first, then the stop cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor. Oh wait, no: the description says ligand ORF at 5', fused to mCherry with a stop in loxP cassette. Then the receptor ORF is at 3', with a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So the structure is ligand (CBA promoter) followed by a stop cassette, then IRES, then receptor with its own stop cassette.

In a bicistronic vector, the first ORF is under a strong promoter, the second is under IRES. So without Cre, both stops are in place. When Cre is expressed (like in neural crest via SOX10-Cre), the loxP and lox2272 sites would be recognized. The ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, so Cre would delete it, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, so Cre would delete that, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't detected. So why isn't the stop being excised?

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So the initial construct has the ligand ORF with a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) before mCherry. The receptor ORF has a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) before eGFP.

So when Cre is
