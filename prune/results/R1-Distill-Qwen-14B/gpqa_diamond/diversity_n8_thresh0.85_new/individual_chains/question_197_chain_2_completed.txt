Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester group. Oh wait, wait—no, wait. Red phosphorus with HI might be part of a reaction like the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Or wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Oh wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester. Or perhaps it's more about the elimination reaction. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

So the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! I think this is the condition used in the preparation of alkenes from alcohols. Like the dehydrohalogenation, but wait, actually, in the presence of a base, you'd get elimination. Oh wait, but red phosphorus is used with HI in the hydrolysis of an acid chloride. Oh wait no, wait. Red phosphorus with HI is often used to convert an alkyne into an alkene. No, wait, that's using another reagent. Hmm. Or perhaps it's about the reaction between an alkyne and HI in the presence of red phosphorus, which would be for the hydration of alkynes. No, wait, wait. Another thought: Maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But then why red phosphorus?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the data we have. The IR and NMR of Compound X. Let me parse that.

The IR data includes peaks in the 3400–2500 cm-1 region. That's the range for O-H and maybe C-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The peaks at 1720 cm-1 suggest an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, 1720 could be a carbonyl. Esters usually have around 1740, but they can vary. Wait, another thought: The 1720 could be an acid chloride, but those are higher. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but 1720 is a bit low for a ketone. Wait, wait, maybe it's an ester. Because if it's an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might be hydrolysis. Or maybe the compound is an ester that's undergoing some other reaction.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has peaks at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet for 1H. That's probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then why the IR would have a peak at 1720 cm-1? Because a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but let's see the other peaks.

The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like a substituent on the benzene ring at the para position. So maybe it's a para-substituted ring with something attached.

Then there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like an oxygen. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) indicates a CH3 group attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain.

So putting this together, maybe the aromatic ring has a substituent that's a chain. Let's think: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. So the structure might be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached. But wait, wait. If the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, that doesn't fit with a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1 (which we have), and the carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So 1720 is a bit higher. Oh, but wait, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have a carbonyl around 1740, but sometimes it can be lower depending on the substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid anhydride, but I think that's less likely.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is more characteristic of an aldehyde proton (which is around 9-10 ppm), but that's a singlet. Wait, but aldehydes have a triplet around 9-10, unless deshielded. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch in the 2500-3300 region, which is present here. So let me think again. If the IR has a peak at 1720, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

But wait, the NMR's 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is a strong indication of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps that's a bit confusing. Because if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the IR says 1720. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a conjugated system. For example, a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl. Let's think: Let's say the benzene ring has a substituent that's a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenoic acid or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. If it's an aldehyde, then the IR would have a peak around 2820, 2720 cm-1 (the characteristic aldehyde stretch) but in the given IR data, the 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region, perhaps indicating an O-H stretch or an N-H, but we don't have any info about N. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's an ester, then the IR would have a peak around 1740, but 1720 is a bit lower. Could it be a conjugated ester or maybe something else?

Let me think about the substituents on the aromatic ring. The NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region, 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H. So para substitution. So the substituent is in the para position.

Then the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to an electronegative group, like oxygen. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to that. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to another group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is likely the end of an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-C(O)-R, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's a propanoic acid substituent. Let me try to draw it.

So, if the benzene ring is para-substituted with a group that has a carbonyl, perhaps a propionyl group. Let's imagine the structure: Benzene with a substituent like -CH2-COOH. Wait, but then the NMR would have the carboxylic acid proton at around 10-12 ppm. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR shifts. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 1H. That suggests it's likely a -COOH proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 and are split into triplets or other patterns, not broad singlets. So I think it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

So the substituent would be a -COOH group attached to the benzene ring in the para position, but wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of the substituent. If the benzene ring has a group like -CH2-COOH, then the substituent would be a propanoic acid group attached via the middle carbon. Hmm, but let's look at the NMR again.

The protons in the substituent: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2. Wait, but in the case of a substituent like CH2CH2COOH, that would be similar to a propionoic acid group. Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent like CH(CH2CH3)COOH.

Wait, but looking again at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet) for 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another group. So, perhaps a structure like CH(CH3)(something), such as -CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options to see what they are, and maybe that will give a clue.

Options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so the options are either substituted benzene rings or substituted benzoic acids.

From the IR and NMR data, the compound has a carbonyl group. If the product is a benzoic acid, then the starting material would have been an ester or another group that upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI would become a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. The reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. So what would that do to a compound?

I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, in the presence of an ester, perhaps. Wait, but no, esters usually require more acidic conditions, like H2O and acid catalysts, or maybe base.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus is used with HI to selectively reduce triple bonds to cis alkenes. Or wait, maybe in the presence of an alkyne, it's a hydration reaction. Wait, no, that's with HgSO4 and H2SO4, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. So, if the starting material is an ester, the reaction with HI might be a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But then, under what conditions? Red phosphorus is sometimes used in the hydrolysis of acid anhydrides or acid chlorides. Wait, red phosphorus can be used with HI to convert acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. Because acid chlorides (RCOCl) react with HI: RCOCl + HI → RCOOH + HCl. But wait, red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI to do what? Oh, perhaps it's the conversion of an acid chloride to an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Then, under hydrolysis, it would become a carboxylic acid. But the typical conditions for ester hydrolysis are acidic or basic. For example, under basic conditions, you get the carboxylate, which then acidified gives the carboxylic acid.

But in this case, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps it's a different process.

Wait, maybe I should consider the reaction of an ester with HI and red phosphorus. Let me think. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. So perhaps the ester group is being reduced. But wait, esters are reduced to alcohols. For example, using LiAlH4, esters are reduced to alcohols. But under red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the elimination reactions. For example, if there's a vicinal dihalide, it can eliminate to form an alkene. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. If the ester is treated with HI, the O of the ester attacks the HI, but I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps it leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think. An ester (RCOOR') can react with HI in a nucleophilic substitution. The mechanism would involve the attack of I- on the carbonyl, leading to the formation of RO-CO-OH, but that's not correct. Wait, no, perhaps the ester would undergo hydrolysis in the presence of HI, but since HI is a strong acid, it would protonate the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → likely a carboxylic acid proton.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → para-substituted aromatic.

Then the rest: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

Wait, the 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the chain is something like CH2CH3 connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH, which is connected to a carbonyl.

Wait, let me draw this. The substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-CH2-COOH? No, because the NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH2 next to the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3) group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a methyl attached to a CH. So, something like CH(CH3)(something). The 0.9 ppm triplet is a CH2CH3. So maybe the substituent is a CH2CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)COOH? Let's see.

So, the chain would be benzene ring - CH2 - CH2 - CH(CH3) - COOH.

But then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3 group. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a triplet, which is consistent with a terminal CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the adjacent CH2 groups. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH attached to the methyl group and the carbonyl.

Putting this together, the substituent would be a pentanoic acid group? Wait, no, perhaps a propanoic acid group. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group attached to the benzene with a carbonyl.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group in para positions.

But how does that fit with the NMR?

Let me think about the structure of sec-butyl. Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, the correct structure is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait, no. Let me think: The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's not correct. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, wait, but wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So the substituents are in para positions.

The substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be benzene-4-COOH and benzene-1-CH2CH(CH3)CH2-?

Wait, no. Wait, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. So, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene.

Wait, let me think: The substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.

So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the NMR. The substituent has a CH2 group next to the ring, then a CH that's attached to a methyl group and a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH3 group. So, that would be at the end of a chain. So the substituent on the ring is attached to a chain that ends with a CH2CH3. So, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached in such a way that the end is a CH2CH3.

Wait, for example, the substituent could be a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to a methyl and the end is a CH2CH3. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, but let's think about the NMR again.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, perhaps the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the CH2 next to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH.

So, the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH group attached. Wait, that would make it a propanoic acid substituent.

Wait, let me see: The substituent would be a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch.

Wait, if the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH, that would give the NMR signals as follows:

The CH(CH3) group would have protons that are split into a multiplet. The CH3 attached to it would be a doublet at 1.4 ppm, because it's attached to a CH that's next to another CH2.

But I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let me try to correlate each NMR peak with possible groups.

Looking at the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks, which are doublets, suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, the substituent is in the para position relative to another group. Wait, but if it's a benzoic acid, then the substituent is the COOH group, and perhaps the other substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a CH2CH(CH3) group at position 4.

Wait, but then the substituent chain would be CH2CH(CH3) attached to position 4. How would that fit into the NMR?

The CH2 adjacent to the ring (position 4) would have protons at around 2.9 ppm, perhaps as a quartet or something else, but the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2COOH group, but that would be a straight chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, with the middle CH being next to the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituent is -CH2-CO-O-R, but then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the ester would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

But let me think about the reaction again. If the starting material is an ester, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the ester is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So, the product would be a benzoic acid with some substituent.

But looking at the options, options C and A are benzoic acids. Let me check option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the starting compound is an ester, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but then what would the starting material's NMR look like? The NMR given is for Compound X, which reacts to form the product.

So, if Compound X is the ester, its NMR would show an ester group. But the given IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with an ester. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would be the ester's O-H? No, wait, esters don't have O-H unless it's a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the starting compound is an ester. Wait, but the 10.5 ppm in the NMR is a broad peak, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then its NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 ppm. Unless it's an α,β-unsaturated ester, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the starting material and the product. So, the product is formed when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid, then the product would be a benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, perhaps that's the product.

But let's think about the structure of X. If X is an ester, its IR would show a strong peak around 1740 cm-1. But in the given data, the IR is at 1720 cm-1, which is a bit lower. Maybe it's an ester with some electron-donating groups, which lower the carbonyl stretch.

The NMR of X would have the ester oxygen, but perhaps the H attached to the carbonyl. Wait, but the NMR given for X has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet of 1H. That suggests a carboxylic acid proton, not an ester. So, perhaps the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then why the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the starting material is an acid anhydride. The IR would show a peak around 1800 cm-1 for the anhydride carbonyl, but the given peak is 1720, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. The IR would show a peak around 1715 cm-1, which is close to 1720. So, if X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do what?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkenes from alcohols via elimination. But if X is a ketone, maybe it's undergoing some kind of reduction. Wait, red phosphorus is a reducing agent, but under what conditions? Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration reaction? Or perhaps in the preparation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is an alkyne. When an alkyne reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it can add hydrogen across the triple bond. For example, an alkyne with two H's added would become a trans-alkene. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. But that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too stuck on the reaction. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Then, the product would be a benzoic acid derivative, as in option C.

So, the product would have a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

But how would that fit with the NMR of the starting material?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and its NMR would have the ester oxygen but not the broad peak. But the given NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which doesn't fit with an ester.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a propargyl ester or another structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl ester with a substituent chain. Let me think differently.

If the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the starting material would have been the corresponding ester, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

So, the structure would be benzene ring with a COOR group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

The NMR of the ester would show the ester oxygen and possibly the ester carbonyl.

But wait, the given NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet of 1H. Ester groups don't have O-H protons, so that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't an ester but a different compound. Let me think again about the IR and NMR data.

IR: 3400–2500 cm-1 indicates O-H or N-H stretching. Given the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, it's more likely an O-H, not N-H. So, the starting material has an O-H group.

So, the starting material is either a carboxylic acid or an alcohol or phenol.

Wait, if it's a phenol, the NMR would have a broad peak, but the IR would show a strong peak in the 3400 region, but the phenol's O-H is usually around 3200-3600. Also, the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. So, if it's a phenol with a carbonyl group, like a carbonyl attached to the ring? But that would be a ketone, perhaps.

Wait, but a ketone's O-H is not present. So maybe the starting material is a phenol with a ketone substituent. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Because the IR has a strong peak around 1700, which fits the carboxylic acid.

So, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is something else, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, but what would the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI be? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acid chloride, but then the NMR wouldn't have a broad peak at 10.5 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alkyne with a substituent. Let me think: If X is an alkyne, then the IR would show a peak around 3300 cm-1 (sp-hybridized C-H). But the given IR doesn't show that. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is internal, so the C-H stretch is less intense.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to consider the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group in para.

If the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, then the starting material would have been an ester, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Let me think about the NMR of that ester.

Ester's NMR would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, as in the IR data. The ester would have an O-R group, but the NMR doesn't show a peak for an O-R group. Wait, but in the given NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, which doesn't fit with an ester. So perhaps the starting material isn't an ester.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a nitrile. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might do something else, like hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But the IR of a nitrile has a peak around 2250 cm-1, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try to figure out the structure based on the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak is likely a carboxylic acid. So, the structure must have a COOH group.

The aromatic protons are in a para-substituted ring, so the substituent is in the para position relative to another group. But if the COOH is at position 1, then the substituent would be at position 4.

The substituent on position 4 is a chain that leads to a CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think about the substituent as a butyl group:

The substituent would be something like -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH2-?

Wait, but that's not a butyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH3)-.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1.

So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, what's the reaction of this compound with red phosphorus and HI? Wait, benzoic acid derivatives don't typically react with red phosphorus and HI unless it's an ester or another group.

Wait, but if the starting material is an ester, then the product would be the acid. But according to the NMR given, the starting material is the acid, which doesn't make sense because the product would be the same as the starting material.

Wait, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the starting material isn't the acid but an ester, and the reaction converts it into the acid. But the NMR data given is for the starting material, which would have to be the ester. But the NMR data doesn't fit an ester.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a different structure. Let me think again.

The substituent on the benzene is a chain that includes a CH(CH3), a CH2, and a CH2CH3. So the substituent is a butyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3. So the substituent could be a pentyl group, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, it's a -CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. That would be a iso-propyl group? No, iso-propyl is -CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group with a branching. Let me think: the substituent could be a 2-methylpropyl group, which would be a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is a iso-butyl group.

Wait, the iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, no. Let me correct this. The iso-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, that's not correct. The iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of iso-butyl. The iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that can't be right because that would imply four substituents on the central carbon.

Wait, no. The iso-butyl group is actually -(CH2)2CH(CH3). No, wait, no. Let me think: The structure of iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not possible.

Wait, the correct structure of iso-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that's not correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let me try to think differently.

The substituent on the benzene must be a group that, when reacted with red phosphorus and HI, gives a specific product. So, if the product is option C, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction must have converted a substituent into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but why would the substituent change? Perhaps the starting material has a substituent that is a different group but gets converted into a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR of the starting material shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, suggesting a carboxylic acid. So if the starting material is the acid, then the product would be the same, which can't be the case.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the reaction again. What is the product when you react a compound with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. HI is a source of iodide ions. So, perhaps it's involved in a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alkyl bromide or chloride. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would cause an elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but then the product would be an alkene. But the options don't show any alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alkyne, and the reaction adds HI across the triple bond.

Wait, if the starting material is an alkyne, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would give an alkene. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it to an alcohol. But then the product would be a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group with iodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydroboration of an alkyne, but I don't think red phosphorus is used for that.

Another angle: The product is a benzoic acid. So, the reaction must form a carboxylic acid group.

In that case, perhaps the starting material has a group that can be oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But I don't know of a reaction that uses red phosphorus and HI for oxidation to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

But then, the starting material's NMR would have an ester group, not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alkyne with a carbonyl group. For example, a propargyl ester. Reacting with HI and red phosphorus would add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting it into a cis-alkene, but I'm not sure how that leads to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone, but that doesn't fit either.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at each option's structure and see which one matches the given data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is actually -CH2CH(CH3)-. No, wait, that can't be right because that would be a three-carbon chain, but sec-butyl is a four-carbon group. Wait, no, no. Wait, the butyl group is C4H9. So, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that's not right.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The four carbons in a butyl group can be arranged in different ways. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that doesn't make sense because it would have five carbons.

Wait, no. The correct structure of sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that's not possible because that would be a five-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not correct either. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's better to look up the structure.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that would make it a tertiary butyl group. No, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)-. That would make it a iso-propyl group, but with a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but that's a different structure.

Another approach: the NMR shows peaks that suggest a CH(CH3) group. So, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, making it a pentyl group with a branch.

But then, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would correspond to the terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, the substituent would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- attached to the benzene. So, that would make it an isopentyl group? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to consider the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure is benzene with a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

In that case, the substituent would be a four-carbon chain where the branching is at the second carbon from the ring. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that can't be right because that would be five carbons. Wait, no, but butyl is four carbons. So, the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with a branch at the second carbon. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

In that case, the NMR would show signals for the substituent as follows:

The CH2 next to the ring would have protons that are split into a triplet or quartet, perhaps around 2.9 ppm. The CH(CH3) would have a peak around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet for 1H. The CH2 adjacent to that would have protons around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet. The CH3 attached to the CH would be a doublet around 1.4 ppm. The terminal CH2CH3 would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm.

This matches the NMR data given: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Therefore, the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, what reaction would convert the starting material into this product? Well, the starting material must have been an ester, perhaps. If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to the carboxylic acid.

But wait, the given NMR is for the starting material, which would be the ester. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a carboxylic acid. That doesn't fit.

So, perhaps I'm wrong about the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a different compound, and the reaction adds a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that is an alcohol. Then, the reaction would oxidize it to a carboxylic acid.

But then, the reaction conditions would need to be oxidizing, and I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI are used for oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, which upon hydrolysis becomes a carboxylic acid. But the NMR of a nitrile wouldn't show a broad peak at 10.5 ppm.

Hmm, this is getting quite complicated. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data of Compound X are provided, and the options for the product are given. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations from IR and NMR Data:
1. **IR Data**:
   - Peaks in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - A strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

### Analysis of the Reaction:
The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, which are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters or acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. Given the IR and NMR data, Compound X appears to already be a carboxylic acid, as indicated by the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm and the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This suggests that the reaction conditions may not alter the carboxylic acid group but could modify another part of the molecule.

### Structure of Compound X:
The NMR data indicates a para-substituted aromatic ring with a carboxylic acid group and a substituent chain. The substituent chain includes:
- A CH group at **2.9 ppm**.
- A CH₂ group at **1.7 ppm**.
- A CH₃ group at **1.4 ppm** (doublet), attached to a CH.
- A terminal CH₂CH₃ group at **0.9 ppm** (triplet).

This suggests the substituent is a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂CH(CH₃)-), attached to the aromatic ring in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.

### Final Product:
The product, based on the reaction conditions and the structure of Compound X, is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option C, where the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

### Conclusion:
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) likely do not alter the carboxylic acid group but may confirm the structure of the starting material as the final product.
