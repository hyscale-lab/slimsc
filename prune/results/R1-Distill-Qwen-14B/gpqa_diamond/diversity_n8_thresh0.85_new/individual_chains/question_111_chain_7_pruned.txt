Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are A, B, C, D with different structures for A and B. I need to find out which option is correct.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. So, cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me number the cyclohexane ring: position 1 is the ketone. Then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around. So position 2 has an ethyl substituent, and position 6 has a methyl. Wait, but wait, the IUPAC name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, both positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups? Or is it 2-ethyl and 6-methyl? Wait, the nomenclature is a bit tricky here. Let me parse the name: it's cyclohexanone (so a ketone on carbon 1). Then, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or is it 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? No, wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl group and another methyl? Because 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at 2 and 6. But wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl, so the substituents at position 2 are ethyl and methyl, and position 6 has a methyl.

Wait, no. The correct way to read it: the substituents are ethyl at position 2 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 6. Wait, that can't be. Because when you
