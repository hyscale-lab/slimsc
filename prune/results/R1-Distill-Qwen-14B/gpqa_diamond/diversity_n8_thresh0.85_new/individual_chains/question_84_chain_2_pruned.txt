Alright, so I've got this question here about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that allows converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically when approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation.

Hmm, okay. Let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down. So, the topic is numerical methods for solving partial differential equations, specifically heat equations. Higher-dimensional problems are more complex, so using finite difference approximations is a common approach. But when it comes to parallel processing, certain methods are needed to split the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously.

The question mentions matrix exponential functions. Oh right, the solution to a system of linear differential equations can be expressed using the matrix exponential. In the context of heat equations, which are parabolic PDEs, the solution often involves exponentiating the discretized operator matrix. But directly computing the matrix exponential can be computationally expensive, especially for large matrices, which is why they're using a fractional approximation here.

Now, the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm to a parallel one. So what's needed for parallelism in this scenario? I remember that methods like the parallel shooting method or the use of domain decomposition might be involved. Alternatively, maybe it's about how the matrix is structured.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is important in numerical methods to ensure that the errors don't grow uncontrollably. But I'm not sure how stability analysis directly relates to converting to a parallel algorithm. It's more about ensuring the method works correctly rather than how it's implemented for parallelism.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal boundary conditions can complicate things, but I'm not sure how they tie into parallel algorithms. Nonlocal conditions might affect the setup of the problem, but perhaps not the parallelism itself.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximations are used to approximate the matrix exponential more efficiently. If the approximation has complex roots, that might affect the splitting of the problem into parallel tasks. Because complex roots can lead to oscillatory solutions, maybe this affects the way the matrix can be split or the regions that can be computed independently.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are a way to decompose a complex function into simpler terms. If the approximation can be broken down into linear parts, each part could be handled by a different processor in a parallel setup. So this might be about how the approximation is structured, allowing it to be split into independent computations.

Wait, so the question is about the key factor in converting the algorithm to parallel. So in the sequential case, you compute the matrix exponential step by step. In parallel, you might need to split the computation into parts that can be done simultaneously.

If the fractional approximation allows for a partial fraction decomposition, each fraction could represent a part that can be computed in parallel. For instance, if the approximation can be expressed as a sum of simpler fractions, each with their own exponentials, then each part can be computed on different processors and then combined. That would make the algorithm parallel.

But another angle: matrix exponentials can sometimes be split if the matrix can be decomposed into commuting parts. For example, if the matrix A can be written as A = A1 + A2, and A1 and A2 commute (i.e., A1*A2 = A2*A1), then e^{A} can be written in terms of e
