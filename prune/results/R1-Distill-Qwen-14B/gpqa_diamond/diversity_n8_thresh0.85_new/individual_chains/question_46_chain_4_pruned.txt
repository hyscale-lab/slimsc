Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about the reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis is when two alkenes exchange their alkyl groups. So, the reaction usually breaks and reforms double bonds. But wait, in this case, the starting material is just a single alkene, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So what's happening here?

Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Hmm, no wait. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right? So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count: pent-1-ene is five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Then, 3-methyl would have a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), then CH2CH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, that doesn't make sense with pentene. Oh wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So substituting a methyl group on carbon 3: CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, but that would make six carbons. No, wait, no, because pentane is five carbons. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The correct IUPAC name would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Let me count: carbon 1 is CH2=, carbon 2 is CH-, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), and then
