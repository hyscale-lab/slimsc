Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think it through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I guess means they're spread out evenly in all directions without any particular pattern. The big thing here is how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So I need to figure out the relation between the number of stars and the parallax.

Wait, what do I remember about parallax? Oh right, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax (in arcseconds). So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsec is 1 parsec away, which is relatively close. If the parallax is smaller, like 0.5 arcsec, the distance is 2 parsecs.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So if I have a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Because the stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of space at that distance. But wait, how does the volume relate to parallax?

Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, but a shell would have a surface area multiplied by the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and the thickness is dr. So the volume element is 4πr² dr.

But here, we're dealing with parallax instead of distance. Since plx = 1/distance (d), then distance d = 1/plx. So let's substitute that into the volume element.

Volume element = 4π ( (1/plx) )² * dr. Wait, but dr is the change in distance. I need to express dr in terms of dplx, the change in parallax.

Hmm, since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as parallax decreases, distance increases. But since we're talking about a range of plx, maybe the negative can be ignored for the magnitude.

So substituting into the volume element: 4π (1/plx²)² * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the volume element in terms of parallax. Let me approach it differently. Let me express everything in terms of plx.

d (distance) = 1 / plx.

So when parallax changes by dplx, the change in distance dr is approximately dr = - (dplx) / (plx)². Because the derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx is -1/(plx)². So dr = - dplx / (plx)^2.

But volume is 4π r² dr, so substituting r as 1/plx, and dr as above.

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - dplx / plx² )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's compute it properly. The volume of a thin shell at distance d (or plx p) with thickness dr is 4πd² dr
