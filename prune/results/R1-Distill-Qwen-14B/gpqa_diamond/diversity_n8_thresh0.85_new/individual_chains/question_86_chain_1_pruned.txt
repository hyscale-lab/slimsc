Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a chemist performing two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B. Each is treated with a different reducing agent: LiBH4 and BH3. The products are both (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one), but one is the R configuration and the other is the S configuration. The question is asking which starting materials A and B correspond to each reaction, with the options given.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, but they might have different effects. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. But BH3 is part of the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which is for adding boron to alkenes in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, the scenario here is that each starting material is a compound that, when treated with either LiBH4 or BH3 followed by H+, gives a specific product. So let's think about what each reagent does.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H-pyran-2-one suggests that the ketone is at the 2-position. So the product is an cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how do LiBH4 and BH3 play into this? Let me think. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but wait, no, maybe it's more about reducing esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters or ketals, which upon reduction give the products.

Wait, wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and when treated with a reducing agent, they are converted into alcohols, which then form the cyclic hemiacetal, leading to the pyranone structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and upon treatment with a reducing agent, they are opened up and the product is formed. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think about the reaction mechanisms.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, esters can be reduced to glycols using LiBH4. Alternatively, if the starting material is a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol.

But
