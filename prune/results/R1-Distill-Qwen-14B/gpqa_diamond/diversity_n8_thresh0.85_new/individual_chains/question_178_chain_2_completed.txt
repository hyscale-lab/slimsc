Okay, so I've got this problem about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the mass dimension of the coupling constant determines renormalizability. So I need to find the mass dimension of κ and then see if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I should recall what each term in the Lagrangian's mass dimension is. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because in four spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so the integral ∫ d^4x L must be dimensionless. So each term in L must have mass dimension 4.

Let's break down the term κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Each field has a certain dimension, and so does κ, which we're trying to find.

I remember that the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because ψ is a spinor, and in four dimensions, the equation of motion (from the Dirac Lagrangian) is dimension 4, so the kinetic term is ψ γ μ ∂_μ ψ, which has each ψ with dimension 3/2 since ∂_μ is dimension 1.

Then the field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from electromagnetism or Yang-Mills. Its mass dimension is 2 because F is made from the field's derivatives, like ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and each A is dimension 1 (since A is a gauge field, like a vector potential). So F would be dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices and their commutators. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So the term σ_{μν} doesn't contribute any mass dimension.

Now, putting it all together. The term is κ times ψ_bar times σ times ψ times F. Let's compute the dimensions.

ψ_bar is the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. ψ is 3/2. F is 2. So the product without κ is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 * 2 is 3, plus 2 gives 5. So the product is dimension 5.

But the entire term must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian. So κ must make the whole term dimension 4. So κ must have dimension 4 minus 5, which is -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Now, the other part of the question: is the theory renormalizable? I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive or zero mass dimension. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, that implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (since dimensions relate to scaling with energy), making the theory non-renormalizable because you can't absorb the divergences into a finite number of parameters.

Wait, but wait. For renormalizability, the coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0. Because in the renormalization process, the counterterms must have the same or lower dimension. If a coupling has negative dimension, you can't write a counterterm (since you can't have an infinite term without going into higher loops or something), making the theory non-renormalizable.

So here, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options, option C says [κ]_M is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Option A says [κ] is -1 and theory is renormalizable, which can't be right. Option D says [κ] is 1 and not renormalizable—no, because our calculation says -1. So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

Thus, the combined dimension of $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\left[\bar{\psi}\right]_M + \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]_M + \left[\psi\right]_M + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

To ensure the term has mass dimension $4$, $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This implies the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
