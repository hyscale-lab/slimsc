Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says: Find the KE of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for mu(+). The options are A to D, each giving two KE values, presumably for the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, right, so this is a particle physics problem, specifically about decay processes. I remember that in such decays, conservation laws apply, like conservation of energy and momentum. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? Or in this case, is the neutrino considered massless? I think in many problems, neutrinos are taken as massless to simplify things, especially in beta decay problems. So I'll proceed under that assumption unless stated otherwise.

So, the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum should still be zero, which means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But wait, if neutrino is massless, then its momentum is just E_nu, since for massless particles, E = |p|c, but I think in units where c=1, E = |p|. Wait, units here are in MeV, so perhaps they're using natural units where c=1. So, p_nu = E_nu.

Wait, but for the muon, which has rest mass, the energy is related to its momentum and rest mass. E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. But again, if c=1, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2. So, E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2).

Since p_mu = p (let's say) and p_nu = p, because they're equal and opposite. So, the total energy would be E_mu + E_nu = E_initial.

The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's at rest. So E_initial = m_pi c^2, which is 139.6 MeV.

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

So, the equation becomes 139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

I need to solve for p here. Hmm, how do I do that? Let me isolate the square root and square both sides.

Let me write:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now square both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

So:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

The p^2 terms cancel out, so:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p.

Rearranging:

2 * 139.6 * p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.

Compute both terms. Let me compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.

139.6 squared: let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: let's calculate, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 +1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So, 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So, 2 *139.6 * p = 8315.67.

So, p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6).

Calculate denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's see, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 30 - (8376-8315.67)/279.2.

Wait, 8376 - 8315.67 = 60.33.

So, 60.33 / 279.2 ≈ 0.216. So p ≈ 30 - 0.216= 29.784.

So p ≈ approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, that's the momentum of the muon and the neutrino. Now, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2).

Let me compute that. 29.78^2 ≈ 887, and 105.7^2 is 11172.49. So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49. Square root of that is about 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the initial energy is 139.6 MeV. So, the neutrino energy E_nu = 139.6 - E_mu = 139.6 - 109.81 ≈ 29.79 MeV.

Wait, but I thought that for the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p_nu, which here is p. So, E_nu should be p. But p is 29.78, so E_nu is about 29.78 MeV. Which matches what I just calculated. So yes, that makes sense.

So, the muon's energy is 109.81 MeV, and its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is ~29.79 MeV, and since it's massless, all of that is kinetic energy.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and 29.79 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for any possible arithmetic errors.

Let me recheck 139.6^2 and 105.7^2 again.

139.6^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute it more accurately.

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Correct.

105.7^2: (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49. Correct.

So, 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67. Correct.
