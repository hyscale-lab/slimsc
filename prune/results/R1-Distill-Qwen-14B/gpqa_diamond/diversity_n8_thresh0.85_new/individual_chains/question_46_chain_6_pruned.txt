Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, not counting ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, the catalyst will break and reform double bonds, right?

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, let me draw that structure to visualize it better. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Oh wait, wait. No, wait, pent has five carbons. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that's six carbons because the main chain is five. Wait, wait, the main chain is five carbons. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2
