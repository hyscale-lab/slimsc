Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about parallax and star distribution.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx. 

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, if I consider a small change in parallax, say dplx, how many stars fall into that range? 

Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess their density in space is uniform. Wait, but parallax is inversely related to distance. So, the number of stars in a certain volume would depend on the volume of that region. 

Let me think about volume in terms of distance. If I have a small change in distance dr, the volume element would be 4πr² dr because it's a spherical shell. Oh wait, but here we're dealing with parallax. Since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by a small amount dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance?

Let me write that down. d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by dplx, the distance changes by dd. Let's see, taking the derivative: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dplx = - plx² dd. Since dplx is a small positive change (because as distance increases, parallax decreases), maybe I should take the absolute value.

So, for a small change in plx, dplx, the corresponding change in volume would be the surface area at that distance times the change in radius. But wait, the surface area at distance d is 4πd². The change in radius would be dd, which is related to dplx. So, the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd) multiplied by the density of stars.

Wait, maybe I should express the volume element dr in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, the volume element is 4π d² |dd| = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²). Because |dd| = (dplx) / plx², right? Because d = 1/plx, so dd is - (dplx) / plx², so |dd| is (dplx)/plx².

So substituting, Volume element dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume would be the density (number per unit volume) multiplied by dV. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the density is constant, say n. So the number of stars N is n * dV. So N = n * (4π dplx / plx^4) ) = (4π n dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dplx). So N per dplx would be (4π n ) / plx^4. So the number per unit parallax range (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, their density is constant. 

The number of stars in a small volume element depends on the volume of that region. For a small change in distance \( dd \), the volume element is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), which corresponds to a spherical shell at distance \( d \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Taking the absolute value, \( dd = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \).

The volume element in terms of parallax becomes:
\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 |dd| = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\right) = \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume element, assuming a constant density of stars. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:
\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Answer: A
