Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem talks about several reactions between substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. My goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, Dâˆžh, and C2v.

Hmm. Let me try to break down each reaction and see what each substance could be.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. What's a bright red product that forms when a solid reacts with a gas? Maybe something like SO3 reacting, but that's a gas. Wait, another bright red substance I can think of is Iodine (I2), but that's a solid. Or maybe it's something like iron(III) oxide? Wait, Fe2O3 is reddish. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, maybe C is something like Na2O2? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: when solid sodium reacts with chlorine gas, you get sodium chloride, but that's white. Hmm. Maybe A is something else.

Wait, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So if C reacts with D, what produces something dangerous? Maybe C is a compound that reacts with a halogen or something. Wait, C is a product from A and B.

Wait, the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C is reacted with water, it produces A, F (strong), and G (weak). So C is probably a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Let's think: For example, if C is something like NaNO2, which when hydrolyzed might produce HNO2 (weak) and NaOH (but that's a strong base). Wait, but the problem states that F and G are acids, so maybe the hydrolysis produces two acids.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite salt. For instance, if C is Na2SO3, then hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then water
