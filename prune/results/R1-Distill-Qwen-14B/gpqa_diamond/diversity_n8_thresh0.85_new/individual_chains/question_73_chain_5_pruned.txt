Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says we have two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²) or something like that. Or maybe it's (v1 - v2) in the denominator? Wait, wait, no, the formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). But since one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate that.

So the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately 0.1428c. Wait, looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and option D also has 0.14c. So that's about 0.14c, I think that's correct. So the relative speed is around that.

Now, the total energy. Each astronaut has kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Wait, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. So each one's energy is gamma times mc². Wait, but their masses are 2m and 3m. So for each, calculate gamma and multiply by their rest mass energy.

Let me think. The formula for energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: 2m, v = 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: 3m, v = 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.1547 times 3 is 3.464, yes.

So total
