Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz in the system's state. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So, I think the formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). 

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

Wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state I'm given is already expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. That's helpful because if the state is |ψ⟩, then ⟨Pz⟩ would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, let me think. The state is a vector (a, b, c) where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2. Since the basis is Pz's eigenbasis, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of Pz.

Looking at the matrix of Pz, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues for each basis vector. The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), so the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the three basis states |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix for Pz is diagonal, right? Because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of Pz. So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalue for the first basis vector is ħ (because the (1,1) element is ħ), the second is 0 (since (2,2) is 0), and the third has eigenvalue -ħ (because (3,3) is -ħ).

So the state is a linear combination of these three eigenstates. The components of the state vector are the coefficients (amplitudes) of each eigenstate.

So the state can be written as: |ψ⟩ = (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/√2)|2⟩ + (-1/2)|3⟩.

To find ⟨Pz⟩, I calculate the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because when you're in an eigenstate, the expectation value is just the eigenvalue.

So for each term:

- The first term: |a|^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4. The eigenvalue is ħ. So contribution to ⟨Pz⟩ is (1/4)*ħ.
- The second term: |b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. The eigenvalue is 0. So contribution is (1/2)*0 = 0.
- The third term: |c|^2 = ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4. Eigenvalue is -ħ. Contribution is (1/4)*(-ħ).

Adding these together: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Now I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, and its eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. But when you square these, each eigenvalue squared is (ħ)^2, 0, and (ħ)^2.

So the expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ would be the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

So:

First term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ².
Second term: (1/2) * 0² = 0.
Third term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ².

Adding them: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2, which matches. So the correct answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $| \psi \rangle = (-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the three basis states $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The state can thus be expressed as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} |1\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |2\rangle - \frac{1}{2} |3\rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the sum of the probabilities of each basis state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in the state vector:

- For $|1\rangle$: $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue is $\hbar$, so the contribution is $(1/4)\hbar$.
- For $|2\rangle$: $| 1/\sqrt{2} |^2 = 1/2$, and the eigenvalue is $0$, so the contribution is $0$.
- For $|3\rangle$: $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue is $-\hbar$, so the contribution is $(1/4)(-\hbar)$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is the sum of the probabilities of each basis state multiplied by the square of their corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, so their squares are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$:

- For $|1\rangle$: $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue squared is $\hbar^2$, so the contribution is $(1/4)\hbar^2$.
- For $|2\rangle$: $| 1/\sqrt{2} |^2 = 1/2$, and the eigenvalue squared is $0$, so the contribution is $0$.
- For $|3\rangle$: $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$, and the eigenvalue squared is $\hbar^2$, so the contribution is $(1/4)\hbar^2$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
