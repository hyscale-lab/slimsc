Okay, let's see. I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That part I get. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The substituents could be anything, but the IR and NMR spectra will help me figure out what they are.

The FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester oxygen. The ester carbonyl usually shows up around 1720-1740 cm^-1. So the compound has at least an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. A benzene ring usually has equivalent protons if it's para-substituted, but since it's di-substituted, maybe the substituents are in positions that make the aromatic protons split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are ortho, meta, or para, but wait, di-substituted can have different substitution patterns. Wait, but if it's a meta substitution, maybe the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. But wait, the ring is benzene, so if it's para-substituted, the ring would have two equivalent protons, but if it's ortho, maybe three sets. Hmm, but here only two aromatic signals. So maybe the substituents are in a position that splits the ring into two sets of aromatic protons. Like, perhaps one substituent is at position 1 and another at position 3. Then the ring would have two doublets or something. Or maybe one substituent is in para, and another is in ortho, creating two different sets. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals after.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or possibly in an ester group. Wait, ester groups have O and carbonyl, but the vinyl signals might come from something else. Maybe the substituents on the ring have double bonds. For example, maybe an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituents are ester groups that are part of a larger structure, like an aromatic ring with two ester substituents. Wait, no, because the ester is a substituent on the ring. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester, and another is a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is part of a larger group, like a vinyl ester.

Wait, in the H NMR, two vinyl signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet indicates coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets (a quartet split into a doublet?) or perhaps a doublet of a quartet pattern. Wait, a doublet of quartets would mean each proton is split by two different coupling constants. Alternatively, maybe a coupling with two sets of equivalent protons. I'm a bit confused about this part.

3. Two signals for â€“CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. Each is a singlet, perhaps, unless
