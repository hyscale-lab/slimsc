Alright, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. Okay, the scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, transfected some cells, but can't get the protein expressed as expected. They found that the plus strand sequence has some issues.

The question is asking why they can't overexpress the protein. The options are A to D. Let's think about each possible issue.

First, the setup: They added a HA tag (hemagglutinin) to the N-terminus. So that should be the beginning of the coding sequence. They used Lipofectamine for transfection, which is a common method. But the expression isn't working.

Looking at the sequence they provided, I'll need to check for possible translation issues. Let's analyze the sequence. The HA tag is a specific peptide, but the main thing here is to see if the coding sequence has any issues that would prevent proper translation.

The first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. So that's good. Then, looking for stop codons. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, or UGA in mRNA. Wait, but the given sequence is the DNA plus strand. So in DNA, the complement would be the coding strand, right? So for the mRNA, it's the same as the plus DNA strand, but T becomes U.

Wait, so the coding sequence is the same as the mRNA. So any T becomes U in mRNA. So the mRNA would have U wherever the DNA has T.

Looking for any in-frame stop codons. Let's scan the DNA sequence for any TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets, because those would be stop codons in the DNA when transcribed. Wait, no, wait. Because the DNA is in the plus strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So the mRNA is built from the DNA's plus strand, so any TAA on the DNA would become UAA in mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Looking through the sequence: Let me go through the DNA sequence and look for TAA, TAG, TGA (the DNA triplets) anywhere, which would code for stop codons.

Looking at the sequence:

Wait, I'll look for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA's plus strand.

Let me go through each triplet:

First part: ATG (start), then TAC, CCA, etc.

Looking for TAA (which would be a stop codon in mRNA as UAA), TAG (UAG), TGA (UGA).

Looking through:

Wait, let me look for TGA in the DNA. Because that would mean UGA in mRNA, which is a stop.

Looking for T-G-A in the DNA:

Looking at the end, the last part is ...GAGTGA3'. So the last part is GAG TGA. So the triplet before that is CAG TGA.

Wait, let me look again. The last part is ...GTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, at the very end, there's a TGA. Let me count from the end:

The last few nucleotides: ...CGAGTGA3'. So the triplet before that
