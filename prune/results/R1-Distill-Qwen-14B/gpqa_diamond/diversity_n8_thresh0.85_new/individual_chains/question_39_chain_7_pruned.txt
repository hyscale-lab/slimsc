Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, one of which is that the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1. Oh right, that's the normalization condition.

Wait, the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside of this region when measured, meaning that the probability of finding the particle outside 1 to 3 is zero. But for the wave function given, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but we have a complex wave function here because of the 'i' term. Oh wait, that's the imaginary unit. But for the normalization, I think we only consider the modulus squared of the wave function, which should integrate to 1.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is a function of x, right? So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. So to find the probability, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3. Because outside this region, the wave function is zero, but in this case, the wave function isn't zero in this region, but the problem says particles were found only between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in this interval, so our integral is from 1 to 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But wait, that's a complex function. So the modulus squared would be (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)², because when you square a complex number, the terms cross, but wait, the wave function is written as (real part) - i (imaginary part). So ψ(x) = A - i B, where A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5.

So the modulus squared is |ψ|² = A² + B². So [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So integrating this from x=1 to x=3 will give us the total probability, which should be 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Hmm, let's split the integral into two parts. The first part is a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, and the second part is ∫0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Calculating the first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is the same as ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that integral is ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Because the total integral equals 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Then a would be the square root of that. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, what's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.7213. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to this value.

Wait, but wait. Did I do the setup right? I assumed that the wave function is
