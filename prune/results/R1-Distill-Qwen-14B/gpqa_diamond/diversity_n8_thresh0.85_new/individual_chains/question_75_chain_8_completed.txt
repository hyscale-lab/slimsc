Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress this protein, but it's not working as expected. They've introduced an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, which is the beginning of the protein. So the construct should produce a fusion protein starting with HA followed by GADD45G.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, which is a common method for transfection. They selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, implying that the plasmid has a selectable marker, probably an antibiotic resistance gene. Then they tested the expression level, but there was no overexpression. So they examined the DNA sequence of the plus strand, and there's an issue.

Looking at the options, the problem could be any of these:

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag isn't correctly formed, which might affect purification or protein function, but wouldn't necessarily prevent expression.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That implies a stop codon is present somewhere in the sequence, causing the ribosome to stop before the full protein is made. Like a premature stop codon.

Option C: No linker sequence, leading to proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly attached without a linker, maybe the cell's proteases are cutting it, but that would probably result in lower levels of the HA-GADD45G protein, not no expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse (or the transfected cells, which are CHO, not mouse) don't have a tRNA for UAA, that would cause issues. Wait, but all three stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are read by the same release factors, so the presence of a stop codon would terminate regardless. So maybe if the coding sequence ends with a UAA, but the host doesn't have tRNA for UAA? No, that doesn't make sense because tRNA doesn't recognize stop codons. They recognize amino acids. Stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So option D is probably wrong.

So the problem is likely either a stop codon in the sequence (option B) or a missing linker causing degradation (option C). Let me look at the given DNA sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me scan through for any in-frame stop codons. The DNA sequence is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be complementary to this, so let's think in terms of mRNA.

The coding sequence is in the plus strand, so when transcribed, the mRNA would have the sequence complementary to the given plus DNA strand (since DNA is double-stranded, mRNA is synthesized from the template, complementary to the plus strand). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mRNA sequence.

Actually, the plus strand of DNA is the same as mRNA except T instead of U. So to find the mRNA, I can replace T with U.

But wait, the construct is for overexpression, so the plasmid must have the coding sequence in the correct reading frame, with the HA tag at the N-terminus.

If the HA tag is at the N-terminus, then the HA sequence should be first in the DNA, followed by GADD45G.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, the first part is ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait, what's TGA in DNA? That's T-G-A, which in mRNA is U-A-A, which is a stop codon (UAA). Oh wait, but wait: in DNA, the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T for U. So if the DNA has a TGA triplet, the mRNA would be UGA, which is another stop codon.

Wait, let's look at the DNA sequence. Let me parse it:

The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first few codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), etc.

Wait, but looking down the sequence, let's check for any in-frame stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA in DNA). Let's scan the DNA sequence:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets. Let's go through:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Oh, wait, looking at the next part: after TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA, the next is TGA.

So that's TGA, which is a stop codon in DNA. So in the mRNA, it would be UGA, which is another stop codon. So the reading frame would end at this point, meaning the HA tag is only partially expressed, and the rest of the GADD45G isn't made. So the HA tag might be partially produced, but the protein would terminate early.

Wait, but the HA tag is probably at the beginning. The HA sequence would be part of the coding sequence. If the HA coding sequence includes a stop codon, then the HA isn't even fully formed, and the rest is truncated.

Wait, in the problem statement, the HA is added to the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA sequence followed by GADD45G. So the HA coding sequence should not include any stop codons. But in the given DNA, after some initial codons, there's a TGA, leading to a premature stop. So the coding sequence for the HA must have a stop codon in it, which would cause the premature termination.

So the problem is that the HA sequence includes a stop codon (TGA), which the ribosome would hit early, leading to no full-length protein. So the HA tag is not correctly expressed, and the rest of the protein isn't made either.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be due to a stop codon in the coding sequence. Option A is about a missense mutation in the HA sequence, but if the HA sequence itself has a stop codon, that's a nonsense mutation, not missense.

So the issue is that the HA sequence introduced includes a TGA triplet, which is a stop codon. So when the construct is expressed, the ribosome stops early, so no overexpression of the full-length HA-GADD45G protein.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but let me check the rest of the sequence. The HA tag is probably a short peptide, so maybe the HA coding sequence includes a stop codon after the HA sequence. But in the given DNA, the HA is part of the coding sequence. Wait, the problem says they introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So the HA coding sequence should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But the presence of TGA (a stop codon) in the middle of the HA sequence would terminate translation prematurely, preventing any of the GADD45G from being expressed.

So this is a problem in the construct design: the HA coding sequence contains a stop codon, perhaps due to a mistake in the inserted sequence. So the HA may not even be correctly expressed, and the rest is not expressed.

So the result is that the HA-GADD45G fusion protein isn't made because the ribosome stops at the TGA codon in the HA part, so the protein isn't overexpressed.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model for overexpressing the GADD45G protein, tagged with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequence at the N-terminus, failed to produce the desired protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals a potential issue in the coding sequence. 

Key observations:
1. The sequence starts with `ATG`, the start codon, followed by several codons encoding the HA tag and GADD45G protein.
2. Scanning the sequence for stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) reveals a `TGA` triplet in the middle of the coding sequence. In the mRNA, this corresponds to `UGA`, another stop codon.
3. The presence of this stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion protein from being expressed. This explains the lack of overexpression observed.

Analysis of the options:
- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA sequence would alter the amino acids but would not necessarily prevent translation of the full-length protein. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B**: The premature stop codon (`TGA` in DNA, `UGA` in mRNA) causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being synthesized. This aligns with the observed failure to overexpress the protein.
- **Option C**: A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would result in degradation of the protein after expression, not a complete lack of expression.
- **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for the `UAA` codon is irrelevant because stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. This option is incorrect.

The most likely cause of the failure to overexpress the protein is the premature stop codon in the coding sequence, which terminates translation early. 

Answer: B
