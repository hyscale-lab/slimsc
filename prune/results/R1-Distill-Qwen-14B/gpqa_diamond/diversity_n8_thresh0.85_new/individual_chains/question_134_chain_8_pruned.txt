Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, the problem states that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are all mixed together. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt, usually releasing heat, which is why enthalpy of neutralization is typically exothermic, so the answer should be negative, I think.

Wait, but wait. I should figure out the moles of each acid and base first. Because the enthalpy change depends on how much acid and base there is. Oh right, because neutralization is about H+ and OH- ions reacting.

Let me list out the acids and bases. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is another strong acid, but since it's sulfuric acid, which is diprotic, I think each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit releases two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH^-.

So, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. But wait, if there's an excess of acid or base, that would affect how much neutralization occurs.

Let me calculate the moles of HCl first. HCl is H+ and Cl^-.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
Volume of HCl is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
So moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is 1:1, moles of H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole releases 2 H+ ions. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, M = 0.3 M.

Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So H
