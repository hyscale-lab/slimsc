Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me read through the question again. So, compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I have to choose the correct structure from the options.

Wait, what's that reaction about? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Epoxidation is the process where a double bond is converted into an epoxide. So, compound X must have a double bond that's been epoxidized.

So, the product has an epoxide group. Looking at the options, all of them except maybe D are epoxides. Let me check the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: That would have a styryl group (like a benzene ring attached to a CH2CH2 group) attached to an oxirane (epoxide). The position is at 2, so the epoxide is probably between two carbons adjacent to the styryl group.

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Hmm, so the substituent is a propenyl group attached via the 1 position of the phenyl, and the oxirane is at position 2. Wait, the structure would be something like a phenyl group attached to a CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2? Not sure, maybe it's a more substituted structure.

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: This would be an epoxide where the substituents are a methyl group and a styryl group. The positions here are 2 and 3 on the epoxide ring.

D) 2-styrylepoxide: This would be an epoxide where both substituents are styryl groups, but wait, no, styryl is a benzene ring attached to a vinyl group. Wait, styryl is (vinylbenzene). So 2-styrylepoxide would have the styryl group attached to one of the epoxide oxygens. Alternatively, maybe the styryl is attached to one of the epoxide carbons. Like, the epoxide is between two carbons, one of which is connected to a styryl group.

Now, the NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR signals are:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

So, the singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm are probably two different methyl groups. Since they're both singlets and same integration, they're each a CH3 group attached to something that doesn't split the signal (like being next to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric position).

The aromatic signals are a set of doublets and so on. Let's see: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). 

Wait, perhaps this is a para-substituted benzene? Or maybe a more complex coupling pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a conjugated system, like a styryl group.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

13C NMR:
- 21.3 (s, 1C)
- 28.4 (s, 1C)
- 126.9 (s, 2C)
- 127.1 (s, 1C)
- 129.1 (s, 2C)
- 130.3 (s, 1C)
- 141.5 (s, 1C)
- 144.1 (s, 1C)
- 197.7 (s, 1C)

Hmm. The 197.7 is a carbonyl, but wait, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Oh wait, wait. Oh, no, the epoxide is an oxygen in a three-membered ring. The carbonyl might be from another part, but let me think again. Wait, in epoxide, the carbons are adjacent to oxygen, so their shifts are usually around 60-70 ppm. But the 197 is way higher. Maybe that's not part of the epoxide. Wait, but looking at the molecular formula, it's C1
