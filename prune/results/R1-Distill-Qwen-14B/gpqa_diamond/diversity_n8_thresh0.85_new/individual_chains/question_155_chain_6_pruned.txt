Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector, and I need to compute the uncertainty of P_z.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then plug those into the formula.

Wait, but wait a second. The state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, right? So that should make things easier because the components of the state are already in the eigenbasis of P_z. That would mean that the expectation value of P_z is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the probabilities (the squares of the amplitudes) of each eigenstate.

Wait, no, the state is given as a column vector, but in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So each component represents the amplitude for each eigenstate of P_z. So let me think: the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

The eigenvalues of P_z are given by the diagonal elements of its matrix. Looking back, P_z's matrix is diag(ℏ, 0, -ℏ). So the eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ for the three basis states.

So the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates. The coefficients are the amplitudes. So the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients.

Let me compute the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ first. Each component of the state is (c₁, c₂, c₃), so the expectation value is c₁*(ℏ) + c₂*(0) + c₃*(-ℏ). Because c₂ is 1/sqrt(2), which when multiplied by 0 gives zero. So let's compute:

c₁ = -1/2 → so (-1/2) * ℏ
c₂ = 1/sqrt(2) → 0
c₃ =
