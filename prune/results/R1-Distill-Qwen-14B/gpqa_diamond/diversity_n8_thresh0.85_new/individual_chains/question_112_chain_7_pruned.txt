Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard basis for spin-½ particles. So, |up> is (1, 0) and |down> is (0, 1) in the computational basis.

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think—what kind of matrix is that?

A_ij is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would be:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Wait a second, that matrix looks like it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Since the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, this operator should also be Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but the problem says that |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, so I probably need to normalize that state first. Because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes.

Let me write the state:

|alpha> = k * [(1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>]

where k is the normalization constant. So first step: find k by ensuring <alpha|alpha> =1.

Compute the inner product:

( (1-i)k* + (2+i)k* ) ( (1+i)k + (2−i)k ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the state is written as a linear combination of |up> and |down>. So in component form, the state vector is [ (1+i)k, (2−i)k ]^T.

The inner product is the conjugate transpose times the original vector. So ( (1−i)k* , (2 + i)k* ) multiplied by ( (1+i)k, (2−i)k ).

So the inner product is (1−i)(1+i)k² + (2+i)(2−i)k².

Multiply each term:

(1−i)(1+i) = 1 + i -i -i² = 1 +1 = 2, since i² is -1.

(2+i)(2−i) = 4 -2i + 2i -i² = 4 +1=5.

So sum is 2 +5 =7. So the inner product is (7)k² =1. Therefore, k²=1/7 → k=1/sqrt(7).

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Alright, now, the operator given has matrix elements A_ij. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, A is as I wrote before.

I need to find the eigenstates of A because the measurement probabilities correspond to the eigenvalues of A.

So, the eigenvalues of the matrix A can be found by solving det(A - λ I) =0.

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So the characteristic equation is:

(0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 =0 → λ² - (ħ²/4) =0 → λ= ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator's matrix is A, which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Pauli X has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Each eigenstate of A is an eigenstate of X, so the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x> which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of Pauli X are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> − |down>)/√2.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. The eigenvalue equation for X is X|+x> = |+x> and X|−x> = -|−x>, right? So the eigenvectors are (1,1)/√2 and (1,-1)/√2.

So, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and −ħ/2 respectively.

So, the problem is now to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, because the probability of measuring each eigenvalue (i.e., each eigenstate) is the square of the amplitude in that direction.

So, |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

I need to find a and b, then the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

So, let me first express |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2

|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/√2

So, I can write |alpha> = c |+x> + d |−x>.

So substituting the expressions for |+x> and |−x>,

|alpha> = [ c (|up> + |down>)/√2 ] + [ d (|up> − |down>)/√2 ]

Grouping terms:

= [ (c +d)/√2 ] |up> + [ (c -d)/√2 ] |down>

But we know |alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2−i)/√7 |down>.

So, equating the coefficients:

(c + d)/√2 = (1+i)/√7 → (c + d) = (1+i)√2 / √7

Similarly, (c −d)/√2 = (2−i)/√7 → (c−d) = (2−i)√2 / √7

So we have a system of two equations:

1. c + d = (1+i)√(2/7)

2. c - d = (2−i)√(2/7)

We can solve for c and d by adding and subtracting these equations.

Adding them: 2c = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * √(2/7) = (3)√(2/7) → c= (3/2)√(2/7 )

Subtracting them: 2d = [ (1+i) − (2−i) ] * √(2/7) → (−1 +2i )√(2/7) → d= (−1 +2i ) * √(2/7)/2

Wait, let me compute this:

The equation 2d is (1+i - 2 +i) multiplied by √(2/7):

( (1-2) + (i + i) ) → (−1 + 2i )

So 2d = (−1 +2i ) * √(2/7 )

So d = (−1 + 2i ) * √(2/7 ) /2

Similarly, c is ( (1+i) + (2−i) ) * √(2/7 ) /2 → (3 ) * √(2/7 ) /2 → (3/2) √(2/7 )

But perhaps it's easier to write c and d as:

c = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / (2√(7/2)) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the squares of c and d to get the probabilities.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x> will give me the amplitudes.

Because |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |< +x | alpha>|², and similarly for |−x>.

So, let's compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is (1/√2, 1/√2 ), because |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2, so the conjugate is (1/√2, 1/√2).

|alpha> has components ( (1+i)/√7, (2−i)/√7 ).

So the inner product is (1/√2) * (1+i)/√7 + (1/√2) * (2−i)/√7

= [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / (√7 * √2 )

= [ 3 ] / (√14 )

So the amplitude a is 3/(√14 ), so |a|² is (9)/(14 ) ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, compute < −x | alpha >.

|−x> is (|up> - |down>)/√2, so < −x | is (1/√2, -1/√2 )

Inner product is (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (-1/√2)(2−i)/√7

= [ (1+i) - (2−i) ] / (√7 √2 )

= [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ] / (√14 )

= ( -1 + 2i ) / √14

So the amplitude b is (-1 + 2i)/√14.

The modulus squared is |b|² = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (14) → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. But wait, 9+5=14, so that adds up to 1.

So the probabilities are 9/14 for +ħ/2 and 5/14 for -ħ/2.

Wait, but let me check the calculation of <−x|alpha>.

Wait, let me recompute that step.

< -x | alpha > = (1/√2) * (1+i)/√7 + (-1/√2) * (2−i)/√7.

So, (1+i − 2 +i ) / sqrt(14) → ( (1-2) + (i +i ) ) → (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So the modulus squared is |(-1 + 2i)|² / 14 → (1 +4 ) /14 → 5/14.

So the two probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm, 9/14 is 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3hbar/sqrt(7)

Option C: 0.28, 0.72, hbar/sqrt(7)

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7)

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.643, so option A has 0.64, which is close. But the third part is the average value of the operator A.

Wait, the average value is <alpha|A|alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities.

In this case, the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the average is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] * ħ/2 → (4/14) * ħ/2 → (2/7) ħ/2 → (2 ħ)/(7*2) ) → ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has the average value hbar/7, which matches.

Wait, but the probabilities for option A are 0.64 and 0.36, which are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14 ≈0.3571, which would round to 0.64 and 0.36. So option A seems correct.

But wait, another way to calculate the expectation value is to compute <alpha|A|alpha>.

Let me compute that to confirm.

A is the matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/√7 , (2−i)/√7 ]

So, compute A |alpha>:

First component: 0 * (1+i)/√7 + (ħ/2) * (2 -i)/√7 → ( (2 -i) ħ )/( 2√7 )

Second component: (ħ/2) * (1+i)/√7 + 0 * (2−i)/√7 → ( (
