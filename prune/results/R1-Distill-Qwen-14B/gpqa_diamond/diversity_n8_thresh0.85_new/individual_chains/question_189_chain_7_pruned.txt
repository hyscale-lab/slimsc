Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and broken symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given particles isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Wait, I remember that when a symmetry is spontaneously broken, it leads to the appearance of new particles called Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem states that for each broken continuous symmetry, there's a corresponding massless boson. But wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism breaks symmetry, and the Higgs is a massive particle. Oh right, because the symmetry is broken by a scalar field getting a vacuum expectation value, which gives mass to some bosons through the Higgs mechanism.

So the particles in the options: which ones are Goldstone bosons or related to broken symmetries.

Phonons are quantized sound waves in crystals. They arise from the vibrational modes of atoms in a lattice. I think phonons are related to broken translational symmetry in solids. Because in a crystal, the translational symmetry is broken compared to a liquid or gas. So phonons are Goldstone bosons for that broken symmetry. So A is associated with broken symmetry.

Skyrmions are topological solitons originally proposed to model nuclear particles, like pions. Wait, pions are also Goldstone bosons. Skyrmions are more about having nontrivial topology, like in certain field configurations. I'm not sure if they are directly tied to spontaneously broken symmetry, but I think they can arise from such scenarios in certain models, maybe in the context of chiral symmetry breaking. So B might be associated.

Magnons are the quanta of spin waves in magnetic materials. These are similar to phonons but for magnetic moments. So when magnetic ordering happens, like in a ferromagnet, the continuous symmetry of the disordered state is broken, leading to magnons as Goldstone bosons. So C is associated with broken symmetry.

Pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When the quark condensate forms, the chiral symmetry is broken, and the pions are the massless particles that result (though they get a small mass due to electromagnetic interactions). So D is associated with broken symmetry.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So looking back, the options are A, B, C, D. Phonon is from broken translation symmetry, so yes. Skyrmion... Hmm, I'm a bit iffy on that. Skyrmions are solutions in a model where symmetry is unbroken but certain constraints lead to solitonic solutions. Or perhaps they can also arise from broken symmetries. For example, in the context of pion physics, Skyrmions are used to model nuclei, but the pions themselves are Goldstone bosons.

Wait, another angle: Which of these is not a Goldstone boson? Because the question is about particles associated with spontaneously broken symmetry. Goldstone bosons are from continuous symmetries broken spontaneously. So:

- Phonon: Yes, from broken translational symmetry in crystals.
- Skyrmion: Not a Goldstone boson. Skyrmions arise due to topological reasons, perhaps from a symmetry that's not spontaneously broken but is more about the vacuum structure. Or maybe from a discrete symmetry. I'm not so sure. Alternatively, Skyrmions can be solutions in a theory even when the symmetry isn't broken. Or maybe they are associated with a broken symmetry but not as Goldstone bosons.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each particle's origin.

Phonon: yes, from crystal's broken translational symmetry. So associated.

Magnon: yes, from broken magnetic symmetry (like in ferromagnetism). So associated.

Pion: yes, from chiral symmetry breaking. So associated.

So the odd one out is Skyrmion. Because Skyrmions are more about topology and solitons, maybe not directly tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry. Or perhaps they are, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think Skyrmions are not Goldstone bosons. Because they're topological, so they don't come from
