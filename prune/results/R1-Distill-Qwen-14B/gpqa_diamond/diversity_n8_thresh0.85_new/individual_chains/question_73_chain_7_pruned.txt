Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, the first thing I think is that since they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds, like in classical mechanics. Oh wait, right, because at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So I should plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that: 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, and c squared over c squared is 1. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (0.1c) / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857, so about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c, which is one of the options.

Now, the total energy of the system. Oh, right, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest masses. Each astronaut's energy includes their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. So total energy E_total is the sum of each astronaut's energy.

The formula for total energy of an object is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate gamma for each astronaut and then multiply by their respective masses, then add them together.

Let's compute gamma for each. For the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Next, the second astronaut (3m) at 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) which is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So their energy is 1.1547 * 3m * c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 *3 is approximately 3.464 m c².

Now add the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So roughly 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc^2. That fits. Option D has E=5 mc^2, which is lower, so probably not. Option B has E=4.96, which is less than 5.96. Option A's E is mc^2, which is way too low.

So the correct answer should be option C.
