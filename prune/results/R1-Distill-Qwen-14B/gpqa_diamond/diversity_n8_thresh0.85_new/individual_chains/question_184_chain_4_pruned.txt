Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The starting material is benzene, and I have to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

Hmm, let me first visualize what the target molecule looks like. Benzene rings have six positions, right? The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So numbering them, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

Wait, no, actually, the IUPAC numbering for such a compound would depend on the substituents. Let me think. The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Nitro is a strong meta-director, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky group which is a weak activating group, but since it's a substituent, it directs incoming groups to certain positions.

Wait, but the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the numbering would have the ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So that's like a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.

But wait, that's three substituents all adjacent to each other. How does that happen? Let me think about the synthesis steps.

Benzene is the starting material. So the first step would be to add one substituent, then another, then the third. But the order of adding these substituents is crucial because each substituent will affect where the next one attaches.

Let me list the substituents:

- tert-butyl (a bulky alkyl group, which is activating, so it's a strong ortho/para director)
- ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3; an activating group, ortho/para director)
- nitro (a deactivating, meta-directing group)

Wait, but nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing. So when introducing a nitro group, it's best to think where it would be placed relative to the existing substituents.

But the target has three substituents, so it's a trisubstituted benzene, which suggests that each substituent is added in a specific position based on the directing effects of the existing substituents.

I think the key here is to determine the order in which the substituents are added so that each new group is added in the correct position as dictated by the directing effects.

But wait, considering the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, maybe it's better to add it later because once it's present, it will deactivate the ring, making further substitutions harder. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think: when adding substituents, the order affects where each new group goes.

Wait, another approach: let's break down the target structure. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, looking at the ring, they are adjacent to each other in a meta
