Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on stellar abundances and these logarithmic scales, but I'll give it a go.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. Wait, the question is about elemental abundances, specifically silicon. So maybe the mass isn't directly relevant except for context. Let's see.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and similarly 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7.

Wait, the [X/Y] notation is logarithmic. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, actually, in the standard notation, [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) minus log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic difference between the star's abundance and the Sun's.

But wait, the problem says "assuming LTE and using the EW method" â€” I think that's about how they measure the abundances, so maybe not directly relevant to the calculation.

The key is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], but wait no, actually, the ratio of silicon in each star compared to the Sun?

Wait, no. Wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si_1) / (n_Si_2) ? Or maybe the ratio of their abundances relative to each other.

Wait, the wording says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So maybe n_Si1 / n_Si2. But I'm not sure if that's right.

But let's look at what information we have. Let's list out the given data.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

So, I need to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to that in Star_2, right?

Wait, perhaps I can find the abundance of Si relative to H for each star, then take the ratio.

Because if I have [Si/H] for each star, then the ratio would be 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

So, how do I calculate [Si/H] for each star.

Let me think. For Star_1, we have [Si/Fe]_1 and [Fe/H]_1.

In the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, which means the solar abundance of Fe is at the reference level
