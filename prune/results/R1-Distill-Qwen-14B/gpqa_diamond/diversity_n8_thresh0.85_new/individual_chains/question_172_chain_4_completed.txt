Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the excitation of iron atoms and the effective temperatures of the stars. Let me try to break it down.

So, the setup: there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the photospheres. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, what do I remember about excitation in LTE? Oh right, in LTE, the population of energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So the number of atoms in a higher energy state divided by the lower is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation is higher in star_1. Let me think. The problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, if I let N1 be the number in star_1 and N2 in star_2, then N1 = 2*N2.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio N_upper/N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Oh, wait, but in star_1 and star_2, the same energy levels are being considered. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or whatever the lower state is) would be different because their temperatures are different.

But wait, the question is about the specific energy level. So for each star, the excitation level is a certain fraction. Star_1 has twice as excited, so for each star, their excitation can be compared. Let me formalize this.

Let me denote for star_i, the excitation as N_i (the number in the specific energy level). So, N_1 = 2*N_2.

But the ratio of N_i to the lower level (say N_i_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So N_i = (g_i/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_i)) * N_lower, where g_i is the statistical weight. But I think for this problem, maybe the statistical weights are the same, so they can be ignored. Or perhaps the question simplifies by considering the same level in both stars, so the ratio can be directly compared.

Wait, maybe I should write the ratio for each star. For star_1, the ratio of excited to lower is N1 / N1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, for star_2, N2 / N2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). But in the question, what's given is that N1 is twice N2, but we don't know their respective lower levels. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So perhaps it's the same energy level in both stars. Or perhaps it's the same transition, so same ΔE. But perhaps the question is that for each star, the number in that energy level is N1 and N2, and N1 = 2*N2.

Wait, but in LTE, the population of a particular level depends on the temperature. So for each star, the fraction in that level is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is comparing the excitation in both stars at the same level. So in each star, the number of atoms in that specific level is N1 and N2, respectively. And N1 = 2*N2.

Wait, but the ratio of N1 to N2 would be (N1/N2) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) * (g1/g2), but assuming same g, then N1/N2 = exp[ΔE/(k)(1/T1 - 1/T2)].

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's approach it step by step.

The Boltzmann factor says:

N_i / N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, assuming the same level in both stars, but different temperatures. Let's set E_i as the specific energy level in star_1, and E_j as the same level in star_2. Wait, no, maybe E_i is a higher level than E_j. Or perhaps it's the same level, and the lower level is a common one.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as, for each star, the population in the specific energy level (say E) is given by N = N_total * (g_E / g_lower) * exp( - (E - E_lower)/(k T) )

But since N_total (the total number of atoms) probably differs between the stars, it's tricky. But the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps it's the ratio N1/N2 = 2, but considering that N1 and N2 are populations in the same energy level in their respective stars.

But in that case, the ratio would be:

(N1 / N2) = [ (g_E / g_lower1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / ( (g_E / g_lower2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) ]

But since the same g factors might not be known, perhaps the problem is assuming that the lower level is the same for both stars, or that the same statistical weight applies. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by assuming that the ratio of the populations in the same level for each star is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the specific energy level as a particular transition, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should approach this by considering the excitation in each star relative to a common lower level.

Wait, maybe each star's photosphere has a certain fraction of iron atoms in a specific excited state. Let's say for star_1, the fraction is f1, and for star_2, it's f2. According to LTE, f = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming the same energy levels are considered, and same statistical weights (g_upper and g_lower), the ratio f1/f2 would be exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

Because:

f1 = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

f2 = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So f1/f2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute f1/f2:

f1/f2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )] ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b) 

So, if a = -ΔE/(k T1), and b = -ΔE/(k T2), then a - b = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, that's correct.

So f1/f2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So f1 = 2 f2. Thus, f1/f2 = 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me write that equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

But I can rearrange this equation. Let's see:

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

( k ln(2) ) / ΔE = (1/T2) - (1/T1 )

Wait, but in the problem statement, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but 1.38 is close to the value of Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, yes! So ΔE is equal to k (Boltzmann's constant) multiplied by some temperature, say T. Because 1.38e-23 J is k*T, for T=1 K because k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K.

But wait, in our equation, we have:

ln(2) = (ΔE /k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Substituting ΔE = k * 1 K:

ln(2) = (k * 1 K) / k [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

The k's cancel:

ln(2) = 1 * ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (1/T2) - (1/T1)

Alternatively,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Because:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, that's the equation we get. So looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, exactly. So the correct equation is D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in a specific energy level is observed to be twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

In LTE, the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution, which states that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is proportional to the Boltzmann factor:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( N_{\text{upper}} \) and \( N_{\text{lower}} \) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation levels are proportional to:

\[
N_1 \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad N_2 \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right),
\]

where \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) are the populations of the specific energy level in star_1 and star_2, respectively. The problem states that \( N_1 = 2 N_2 \), so the ratio \( \frac{N_1}{N_2} = 2 \). Taking the ratio of the Boltzmann factors:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \frac{N_1}{N_2} = 2 \):

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the value of \( k \) (Boltzmann's constant, \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) when \( T = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{k \cdot 1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The \( k \)'s cancel:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
