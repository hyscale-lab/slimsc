Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so relative speed—oh right, that's the speed one would measure between the two astronauts. But wait, in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds normally. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Let me recall. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or is it (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²)? Yeah, I think that's right.

Wait wait, but wait—since both are moving in the same direction, their speeds subtract. Oh, right, because if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c /0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, the relative speed options are 1.1c, 0.1c, 0.14c, and 0.14c again. So options C and D have 0.14c.

Now for the energy part. The total energy of the system—they’re asking for the sum of their energies. Oh right, the relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma for that is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together, 2.5 + 3.464 is about 5.964 m c². So E ≈5.96 mc².

Looking at options, option C has E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So the correct choice should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "the total energy of the system." Are they considering rest energy or kinetic energy? Oh, the question says "total energy," which includes rest mass energy. So yes, our calculation is correct. So option C has both the right relative speed and energy.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy formula is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), speed = \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = 2m \cdot 1.25c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), speed = \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = 3m \cdot 1.1547c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(5.96mc^2\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
