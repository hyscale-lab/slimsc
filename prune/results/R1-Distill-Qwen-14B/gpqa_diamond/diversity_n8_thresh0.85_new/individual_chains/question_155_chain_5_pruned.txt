Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for a given quantum state. The state is an eigenstate of the operator P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for this state.

But wait, the state is not in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is expressed in the P_z basis. Oh wait no, if the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, then the state can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. So to compute expectation values, I can just take the components of the state vector and use them.

Wait, the state is given in the basis of P_z. So when I write the state as |ψ⟩ = (a, b, c), it's in the eigenbasis of P_z, meaning that each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, the matrix for P_z is diagonal, which makes sense because it's diagonal in its eigenbasis. So the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. So the first basis vector corresponds to eigenvalue ħ (since P_z matrix is diag(ħ,0,-ħ)), the second to 0, and the third to -ħ.

So the state is a combination of these three. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4. (1/√2)^2 is 1/2. (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. So 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Yep, so it's normalized.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value. Since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component is an eigenvalue multiplied by the amplitude.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of (amplitude)^2 times the eigenvalue for each component.

So the components are:

First component: -1/2, amplitude squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Its eigenvalue is ħ.

Wait no, wait: the first component of the state vector is the amplitude for the first eigenstate, which has eigenvalue ħ. So the contribution is ( (-1/2) )^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ.

Second component: 1/√2. Its square is 1/2. Eigenvalue is 0, so contribution is 0.

Third component: -1/2. Square is 1/4. Eigenvalue is -ħ. So contribution is
