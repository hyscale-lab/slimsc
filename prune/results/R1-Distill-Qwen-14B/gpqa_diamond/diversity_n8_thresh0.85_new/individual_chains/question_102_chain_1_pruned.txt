Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some genetic constructs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair is found in neural crest cells, and they want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and some beta sheets for the binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

Then, they're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic means two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it's a way to have two genes expressed from a single mRNA, right? So the ligand would be translated first, then the receptor after the IRES.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants used in Cre/loxed systems. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can cut them out in recombination, but I think lox2272 might be a variant that's not recognized by wild-type Cre but perhaps by another, like a mutated version? Or maybe they're using different sites for different purposes.

So when they create the vector, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop, but with another lox site. The idea is probably that Cre will excise these stops, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

They've raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They tested the construct expression on a Western blot after transfecting plasmids into primary astrocyte cultures. The actin loading is used as a control, which is standard.

Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably expressed in neural crest-derived cells. After the offspring are born, they look for fluorescence under a confocal microscope. But they don't see a green signal. Why?

The options are A to D.

So the question is why there's no green signal. The green would come from eGFP. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or the eGFP isn't getting made.

Looking at the construct: the ligand is under CBA promoter, then IRES, then the receptor. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. But there are stop cassettes between ligand and mCherry, and receptor and eGFP, each with different lox sites.

Wait, so the ligand's ORF is before mCherry, but they're separated by a stop with loxP. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or wait, the ORF is for the ligand. So when the vector is made, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or is mCherry a separate marker? I think the ligand's ORF is at 5', then a stop, then mCherry. But with the loxP cassette, maybe Cre can remove the stop and allow the ligand to be expressed, and mCherry to be expressed as a separate ORF downstream.

Hmm, but the focus is on the mouse model. They're using SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in the neural crest. So when the Cre is active, it should excise the lox sites. So in the construct, the ligand and mCherry are under CBA, which I think is a strong promoter, and the receptor and eGFP are under the IRES, which is after the ligand.

Wait, the structure is probably: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF with stop and loxP, then IRES, then receptor ORF with stop and lox2272, then eGFP.

So when Cre is introduced, it would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. Wait, but how do those sites work with the IRES? Let me think. So the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. So the mRNA would be made from the CBA promoter, starting at the ligand ORF. The first ORF is ligand, then after the stop, the IRES. The IRES would allow for the translation of the receptor downstream.

But wait, if the ligand has a stop after it with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272, then without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would have a stop before eGFP, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But when Cre is introduced (from the SOX10-Cre mice), it would recombine the lox sites. So for the ligand, the loxP cassette would be removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 cassette would be removed, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but the lox
