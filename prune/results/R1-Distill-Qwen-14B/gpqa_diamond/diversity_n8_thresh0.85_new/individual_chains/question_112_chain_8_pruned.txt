Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully again.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. 

The question is asking me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of an operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So first, I need to figure out what this operator looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because the state is a two-level system), the matrix will be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because when i≠j, Aij is ħ/2, and when i=j, Aij is 0.

Wait, but wait. Actually, looking again, the problem says Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So yes, that's the matrix:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

So this operator A is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

So, the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, because they're just scaled by a factor. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be ±ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The question says, calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So the operator A has eigenstates, say |+x> and |–x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x. So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (|up> and |down>), but the measurement is in the x-basis.

So the approach would be to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and find the probabilities. Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, the measurement is in the σ_x eigenbasis.

Wait, another way: The operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So when you measure A, you'll get either ħ/2 or -ħ/2, depending on whether the state is |+x> or |–x>.

So the probability of each outcome is the square of the amplitude when you project |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to just work with the σ_x eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A is a spin-x operator scaled by ħ/2.

Another approach: To find the probabilities, I can expand |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A and the coefficients squared will be the probabilities.

But first, let's normalize |alpha>.

Given that |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so let me write |alpha> = (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down>.

Wait, but first, what's the normalization factor? Because it's
