Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values, probably for mu and neutrino.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means their momenta have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

I think the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion because it's not moving. So the initial energy is m_pi * c², which is 139.6 MeV. The energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass, so its energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino is massless (I think), so its energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest energy is zero).

Wait, but neutrinos do have some mass, but I think in this case, because the pion's mass is much larger, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So we can approximate it as massless.

So the energy conservation equation would be:
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p_nu c

Since momentum is conserved, p_mu = p_nu in magnitude, but opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of the muon. So p_nu = p as well.

Then, E_mu = sqrt(p² c² + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p c

Total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² c² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c.

Set that equal to m_pi c².

So:

sqrt(p² c^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c^2

Hmm, solving for p. Maybe square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me rewrite without c for simplicity since units are in MeV and c=1 in these units.

So:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Let me denote variables without c: m_pi = 139.6, m_mu = 105.7.

So:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me set x = p.

So equation is sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So:

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x

Compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6^2 = let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, 0.4^2 is 0.16, and 2*140*0.4=112. So (140 - 0.4)^2 is 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100 +5.7)^2=10000 +1140 +32.49=11172.49.

So substituting:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - (2 * 139.6 ) x

Wait, 2*139.6 is 279.2. So:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Rearrange:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

19488.16 minus 11000 is 8488.16, minus 172.49 is 8488.16 -172.49 = 8315.67.

So 279.2 x = 8315.67

Then x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = let's see: 279 *30= 8370, but 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(30-1)=8376 -279.2= 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

But 8315.67 is 218.87 more than 8096.8.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 *29 + 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 is approximately 0.783.

So x ≈29.783.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 279.2 *29.783 is about 29.78 *279.2 ≈ 29 *279=8091, plus 0.78 *279.2≈217.8. So total about 8308.8. Which is a bit less than 8315.67. Hmm, perhaps I should be more precise.

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me
