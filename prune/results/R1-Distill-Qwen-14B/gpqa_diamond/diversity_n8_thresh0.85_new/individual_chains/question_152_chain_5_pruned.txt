Okay, so I just came across this question about quorum-sensing peptides and their effects on yeast. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that a new quorum-sensing peptide was found in Lactobacillus acidophilus. The person treated yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with this peptide and observed the formation of a shmoo. I remember that the shmoo is a structure formed by yeast cells when they're in response to certain mating pheromones. It's like a signal of their readiness to mate. So, the peptide probably is acting like a signaling molecule, causing the yeast to change their behavior.

Now, the next part is about finding the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo. They're using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. I think chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a method to identify DNA regions bound by specific proteins. In this case, they're probably looking for proteins associated with active chromatin regions, maybe transcriptionally active areas.

The question is asking which complex's proteins will be the least observed in this assay. The options are four complexes: nucleosome histone complex, pre-replication complex, pre-initiation complex, and enhancer protein complex.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Nucleosome histone complex. Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin, made of histone proteins around which DNA wraps. Active chromatin is typically more open, like euchromatin, which might involve nucleosome remodeling. So the nucleosome complex proteins are probably present.

Option B: Pre-replication complex. This complex, also known as the origin recognition complex (ORC), is involved in initiating DNA replication. It binds to the origins of replication. But replication happens during S phase, and whether this is active in the shmoo? The shmoo formation is more about mating and cell polarity changes, so maybe not directly related to replication. But I'm not sure if the pre-replication complex is active during that time.

Option C: Pre-initiation complex. This is a set of proteins that assembles on the promoter region of a gene to initiate transcription. The PIC includes RNA polymerase II, various transcription factors. If the chromatin is active, these would definitely be present because transcription is happening. So the proteins from this complex would be abundant in the assay.

Option D: Enhancer protein complex. Enhancers are regions of DNA that increase the transcription of genes. Proteins like transcription factors that bind enhancers would be part of this. Active enhancers are marked by certain histone modifications and proteins, so these would be present in active chromatin, leading to their presence in the assay.

Now, the question is which complex will have the least proteins in the assay. The assay is looking at active chromatin, so the pre-initiation complex (C) is definitely there because transcription is active. The pre-replication complex (B) is about replication origins. But the shmoo formation is a response to pheromones, which leads to changes in gene expression but not necessarily an immediate need for DNA replication. Unless the yeast is preparing to mate, which might involve entering the cell cycle, but I'm not sure if replication is the main focus here.

Wait, I remember that when yeast cells form a shmoo, they are preparing for conjugation, which involves a lot of transcriptional changes. The genes involved in mating are turned on. So, the pre-initiation complex would be active because genes are being transcribed. Nucleosome histone complexes are part of the chromatin structure, so they would be present.

The pre-replication complex is involved in replication. If the cells are in the G1 phase, then ORC (pre-replication) is bound, but during S phase, replication starts. But shmoo formation might not directly correlate with replication timing. Alternatively, maybe during the mating response, the cells aren't actively replicating DNA. So the pre-replication complex might not be active in the regions being analyzed.

Wait, but in active chromatin, replication origins are unwound and replication machinery assembles. But I'm not sure if the pre-replication complex is part of the active chromatin in the shmoo. The question is about which complex's proteins are least present.

So, the options:

A) Nucleosome: present
B) Pre-replication: maybe not active in this context
C) Pre-initiation: definitely present
D) Enhancer: present if enhancers are active.

So the least observed would be the pre-replication complex (B), because the assay is about active chromatin during gene expression, not replication.


The question involves analyzing the proteome of active chromatin in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) treated with a quorum-sensing peptide, which induces the formation of a shmoo. The goal is to determine which protein complex will be least observed in a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay followed by mass spectrometry. The shmoo formation is associated with mating and transcriptional changes
