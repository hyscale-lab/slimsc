Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the first thing I need to do is figure out the new concentration after dilution.

Wait, right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula I remember is M1V1 = M2V2. So initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, volume V1 is 20 mL. After adding 20 mL water, the total volume V2 is 40 mL. So M2 would be M1 * (V1/V2). Let me calculate that.

M2 = 0.05 M * (20 /40) = 0.05 * 0.5 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm. Let's tackle each part one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, let's calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution. Volume is 40 mL = 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So for NaOH, which has a concentration of 0.1 M, the volume needed at equivalence would be (moles NaOH) / (M NaOH) ) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. But wait, the question doesn't ask for the volume, just the pH at equivalence.

At equivalence, the acetic acid would have been completely neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

But wait, the sodium acetate solution will dissociate into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The Na+ is a spectator ion, so the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of CH3COO^-.

So to find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the pH of a sodium acetate solution. The concentration of sodium acetate will be the moles divided by the total volume.

Wait, moles of sodium acetate are 0.001 mol, same as the initial acetic acid. The total volume after adding NaOH is the initial solution (40 mL) plus the volume of NaOH added. Oh wait, but at equivalence, we've added 10 mL of NaOH. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 mL, or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction for acetate is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C ). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02 ) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH =14 -4.98=9.02. Wait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me double-check calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate:

Ka =1.85e-5. So Kb=1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration is 0.02 M. So Kb*C =5.405e-10 * 0.02=1.081e-11. Square root is about 1.04e-5, as before. So pOH ~4.98, pH ~9.02. But none of the options have equivalence pH near 9. Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) 4.26;8.52  
B) 3.17;6.73  
C)4.73;7.00  
D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, the equivalence point in all options is less than 8.5, except option A. But my calculation says around 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute, let me think again. At equivalence, the solution is a buffer of sodium acetate. The solution is acetate ions in water, which hydrolyze to produce OH-.

Alternatively, another way is to calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But in this case, HA isn't present because it's the conjugate base. Alternatively, perhaps using pOH = pKb - log C ?

Wait, no, the formula is pOH = (pKb + log C ) / 2? No, wait, the correct approach is:

The hydrolysis reaction is as I wrote before. The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-]. Assuming x is small compared to initial, then [OH-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C). But maybe the approximation isn't valid here.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02 M.

5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11. Square root is approximately 1.04e-5, so [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. So pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But none of the options have a pH close to 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles. The initial acetic acid is 20 mL of 0.05 M, so moles=0.05 * 0.02=0.001 mol. Then diluted to 40 mL, so 0.025 M as I correctly found. Then when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, to reach equivalence, moles NaOH needed is 0.001 mol, so volume is 0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 mL. So total volume is 50 mL.

Molarity of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the temperature is 25°C, which isn't affecting the calculations because Ka is given at 25°C.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the hydrolysis calculation. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the exact quadratic equation.

So, Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02.

The expression is Kb = x^2 / (C -x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than C, so C -x ≈ C. So x≈sqrt(Kb * C) = same as before, 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH=9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, the equivalence point pHs are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution isn't just sodium acetate. Oh wait! Because when you titrate, you're adding 25% of the NaOH needed, but wait no—the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the earlier calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial concentration after dilution. Let me re-calculate that.

Initial solution: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 mL water, the new volume is 40 mL. So the concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, what's the molar concentration after adding 20 mL of water? Yes, 20 mL becomes 40 mL, so concentration halves.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the volume at equivalence. Oh wait, when you add 10 mL of NaOH to the 40 mL solution, the total volume is 50 mL, so 0.05 L. So the concentration of the acetate is 0.001 /0.05 L=0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe instead of using Kb, I should calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I confused the Kb with the hydrolysis reaction. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer? No, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions, so it's just the acetate ion in solution, which acts as a base.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it without approximation. Let me set up the equation without assuming x is negligible.

The equation Kb = x²/(C -x) where C is 0.02.

So 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x). Multiply both sides: 5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x) =x².

Expanding: 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x =x².

Rearranging: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Let me write a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The quadratic formula solution is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Calculating the discriminant: b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) = (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.575e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] /2. Since x can't be negative, we take the positive solution.

So [ (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10) ] /2 ≈ (6.575e-6 ) /2 ≈3.2875e-6.

So x≈3.2875e-6 M. So [OH-]=3.2875e-6. pOH= -log(3.2875e-6) ≈ 5.485. So pH =14-5.485=8.515, which is approximately 8.52. Oh! That's option A's equivalence point.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier by assuming x is negligible. The more accurate calculation gives a pH of around 8.52 at equivalence. So the equivalence pH is around 8.52, matching option A's second value.

But wait, let me check the calculations again. So, using the quadratic equation:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11, as before.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.575e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.575e-6 ] /2.

Wait, 6.575e-6 is 6.575e-6, and 5.405e-10 is negligible compared to that. So x≈6.575e-6 /2≈3.2875e-6.

So [OH-] is approx 3.2875e-6 → pOH≈5.48 → pH≈8.52.

Ah! So that's why option A's equivalence point is 8.52. But earlier, when I neglected x, I got a pH of 9.02. But the correct approach using the quadratic gives pH≈8.52.

Wait, but that's a significant difference. So at equivalence, the pH is about 8.52. Looking back at the options, option A's equivalence is 8.52, and option D's is 6.92, which is lower. So perhaps the correct equivalence point is 8.52.

But wait, looking back, the problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So I need to compute both values.

But before that, perhaps I should first compute the pH at 25% titration.

25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So let's find how much NaOH has been added.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol (from earlier calculation: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol).

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 =0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized. So the remaining unreacted acetic acid is 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^- ) formed is 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now is a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and its conjugate base acetate. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log( [A^-] / [HA] )

First, let's find pKa. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.735.

Now, the concentrations of HA and A^-.

The total volume at 25% titration is the initial 40 mL plus the volume of NaOH added. How much NaOH is added?

Moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.00025 / 0.1 =0.0025 L = 2.5 mL.

So total volume is 40 mL +2.5 mL=42.5 mL =0.0425 L.

Concentration of HA (acetic acid)= 0.00075 mol /0.0425 L ≈0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^- (acetate)=0.00025 mol /0.0425 L ≈0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈-0.477.

So pH=4.735 + (-0.477)=4.258. Approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A says pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. That matches exactly.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me calculate the exact ratio again.

Moles HA =0.00075 mol, A^- =0.00025 mol.

Ratio is 0.00025 /0.00075 =1/3.

So log(1/3) =-0.477. So pH=4.735 -0.477=4.258, which is about 4.26.

So the pH is 4.26 at 25% titration, and 8.52 at equivalence. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. Diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water gives a total volume of 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = 0.05 \times \frac{20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid (HA)} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{A}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion (A}^-) = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + \text{volume of NaOH added}.
\]

The volume of NaOH added is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of \( \text{HA} \) and \( \text{A}^- \) are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.735 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.735 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.735 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.258 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion (\( \text{A}^- \)). The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion undergoes hydrolysis:

\[
\text{A}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{HA} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( [\text{OH}^-] \approx \sqrt{\text{K}_b \cdot [\text{A}^-]} \):

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.02)} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the quadratic equation for a more accurate calculation gives:

\[
\text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

Answer: A
