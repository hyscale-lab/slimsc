Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics and energy calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are provided: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two energies, which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in most cases, their rest mass is negligible, so we can approximate it as zero. So, the neutrino's energy would just be its kinetic energy because its rest mass energy is almost nothing. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. No, the problem says the rest mass of Pi and mu are given, but nothing about the neutrino. So yeah, I'll proceed with neutrino mass as zero.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino after decay must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That implies that if the muon has momentum p, the neutrino has momentum -p.

But wait, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

So, the energy conservation equation would be:

E_pion = E_mu + E_nu

But E_pion is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Similarly, E_nu is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible. So,

E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu
E_nu = K_nu

So,

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu

But I also know that momentum must be conserved. The total momentum after decay is p_mu + p_nu = 0, so p_nu = -p_mu. The magnitudes are equal. So, the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum is the same as the muon's.

The energy of a particle is related to its momentum via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². For the muon:

E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2

And for the neutrino, since m_nu ≈ 0,

E_nu² = (p_nu c)^2 + 0 => E_nu = p_nu c

But since p_nu = p_mu (but in opposite direction), E_nu = p_mu c.

Wait, so E_nu = p_mu c. So, p_mu c = E_nu.

Substituting into the muon's energy equation:

E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

But E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu. Also, from energy conservation, 139.6 = E_mu + E_nu.

Hmm, so I have a system of equations here. Let me write them down:

1. E_mu + E_nu = 139.6
2. E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

I can substitute E_nu from equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: E_nu = 139.6 - E_mu.

Plugging into equation 2:

E_mu² = (139.6 - E_mu)^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*E_mu + E_mu² + (105.7)^2

So the equation becomes:

E_mu² = (139.6² - 2*139.6 E_mu + E_mu²) + 105.7²

Simplify:

E_mu² = E_mu² + (139.6² + 105.7²) - 2*139.6 E_mu

Subtract E_mu² from both sides:

0 = 139.6² + 105.7² - 2*139.6 E_mu

Then,

2*139.6 E_mu = 139.6² + 105.7²

Let me compute each term.

139.6 squared: let's calculate that. 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and cross terms are 2*139*0.6=166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 MeV².

Wait, maybe using a calculator would be better. Alternatively, I can just compute 139.6 * 139.6.

139.6 * 139.6:

Let me think: 140 * 140 is 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 0.4 less than 140.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 139.6^2:

(139.6)^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112=19488; 19488 +0.16=19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: let's compute that.

105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and 2*1
