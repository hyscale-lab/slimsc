Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on enthalpy of neutralization. From what I remember, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. It's usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this might vary a bit depending on the specific substances.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out how much acid and base are reacting here. But wait, there are two acids and one base. Hmm, HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. The base is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Each Ba(OH)2 can provide two OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH-.

So, the reaction here is between the acids and the base. But wait, when you mix acids and a base, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. But since there are two acids, I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from both and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each.

First, HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, concentration 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (L). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic. Wait, does it fully dissociate in two steps? For the purpose of neutralization, I think we consider both H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH-. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when you mix these, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base. The total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles of H+. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent here is OH- because there's only 0.2 moles of OH- versus 0.28 moles of H+. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain unreacted.

Wait, but neutralization typically uses the H+ and OH- to form water. That means the moles of H2O formed is equal to the moles of OH- available, which is 0.2 moles. Because OH- is the limiting factor.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of equivalents. Equivalents for acid would be H+ ions. So HCl has 0.1 moles H+ (since 1 per mole), H2SO4 has 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+. So total acid equivalents is 0.28. The base has 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.2 moles OH- (since 2 per mole), so 0.2 equivalents.

So, the neutralization would require 0.2 equivalents of acid reacting with 0.2 equivalents of base. So, the acid with the least equivalents will determine how much reacts. Wait no, the OH- is 0.2 equivalents, and the H+ is 0.28. So the OH- will all react, and there will be 0.08 H+ left.

So, the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles (as OH- is 0.2 moles). Thus, the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Now, the enthal
