Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I remember right, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. These can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the name optical isomers.

The question lists four compounds, and I have to determine which ones show this property. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.** Hmm, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism. If the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond, they can rotate. But wait, if there are bulky groups on each ring that can't rotate past each other, then maybe they can have cis and trans isomerism. But for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center or a central plane of symmetry being absent. Looking at this compound, I see that each phenyl ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Let me visualize it: if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it might be chiral. Alternatively, maybe each ring has multiple substituents that create a chiral center. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. Each phenyl ring has two substituents (like at 2 and 6 positions). So, each ring has two substituents, but if the arrangement around the central bond allows for non-superim
