Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally, right? Like, if one is moving at a high speed, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics. And energy... I think it's related to gamma factors and rest mass energy.

Wait, the problem gives their masses as 2m and 3m, and their speeds as 0.6c and 0.5c. So first, I need to find the relative speed between them. Oh wait, wait. Wait, relative speed in relativity. I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait—what's the frame of reference here? Because if both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but wait—wait, no. Oh no, I remember that when one observer is in a different frame, you use the velocity addition formula. But wait, for relative speed, maybe I should calculate the speed of one from the other's frame. Because in relativity, speed isn't absolute. So let's think: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c—both in the same direction, say the positive x-direction. So the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame, or vice versa?

Wait, relative speed is symmetric? No, not really. Because velocity addition is not symmetric. So, let's clarify: I think the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts from the perspective of one of them. Let's say, the relative speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, but the question says "relative speed"—so it could be either, but since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but corrected for relativity.

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the speed of one astronaut relative to the other when considering their velocity vectors. Let me think. The formula for the relative velocity u' when observing from one frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where v is the speed of the moving frame relative to the original frame.

Wait, let's get this straight. Let's say astronaut A is moving at v = 0.6c in the lab frame. Astronaut B is moving at u = 0.5c in the lab frame. Now, what is the speed of B as seen from A's frame? That's the relative speed.

So using the velocity addition formula: the speed u' of B in A's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait no, I got that wrong. Wait, the formula for relative velocities is when you have two frames S and S', moving at speed v relative to S. Then, an object's velocity in S is u, and in S' it's u'. So u' = (u - v)/(1 - u v/(c²)).

Wait, so in this problem, let me consider astronaut A as being in the S' frame, which is moving at v = 0.6c relative to the lab frame S. Then, the speed of astronaut B in the lab frame S is u = 0.5c. So in A's frame (S'), the speed of B (u') is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1 c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates the direction is opposite to the x-direction in A's frame. So the magnitude is about 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but wait—if the question is asking for the relative speed, it's just the magnitude, right? So 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for relative speed. So that's the first part.

Now the second part: the total energy of the system. Hmm. The system is the two astronauts. Each has their own relativistic energy, so I have to compute each of their energies and add them.

The energy of a relativistic object is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, speed 0.5c): gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me calculate it more precisely. 1/sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(4/3) because sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 is 3m * 1.1547 c² = 3.4641 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says 5 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

So the options that have 0.14c and 5.96 mc² are option C.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. Option D has v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc². So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So each astronaut's energy is calculated in the same frame. Wait, but in the lab frame, each has their own energy. So adding their energies in the lab frame gives the total energy for the system. Hmm, yes.

Alternatively, if the system's energy is considered in the center-of-momentum frame, but I don't think that's what the question is asking. The question says "the total energy of the system," which in relativity is just the sum of their energies in the same frame.

So I think the calculation is correct. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the negative sign indicates the direction is opposite to the reference frame.

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1
Mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2
Mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
