Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³ volume, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values are provided as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 for H3PO4.

Hmm, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, right? So I need to figure out the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution. But wait, in a solution with both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, I think these are buffer solutions. Because H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved, and they can buffer the solution around certain pH ranges.

Let me recall. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The three dissociation steps are:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So the salts provided are KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is Na2HPO4, so HPO4^2-). So when they dissolve in water, they'll contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

Wait, but the question is about PO4^3- concentration. How does that happen? Well, in solution, some of the HPO4^2- may deprotonate to form PO4^3-. But given the Ka2 and Ka3 values, the second deprotonation is much less likely than the third. Because Ka3 is much smaller than Ka2. So in a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the PO4^3- concentration would be determined by the third dissociation.

But wait, wait, in the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution is probably buffering around the second or third dissociation. Because when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, they form a buffer. So in this case, the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- could form a buffer around the second Ka (Ka2), but if there's also HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, they'd buffer around Ka3.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The two salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when they dissolve, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's Na2HPO4, which is the sodium salt of HPO4^2-).

So the solution will have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But wait, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).

Wait
