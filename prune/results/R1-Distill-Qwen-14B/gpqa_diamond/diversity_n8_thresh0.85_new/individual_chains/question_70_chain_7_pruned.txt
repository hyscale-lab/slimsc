Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. I remember that molecular symmetry groups are determined by the symmetry elements present in the molecule. Common groups include things like Cn, Dnh, Td, Oh, Ih, etc. So I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its symmetry.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I'm thinking, what bright red product could that be? Maybe something like a transition metal compound. Oh, wait, I remember that copper(II) compounds are often blue, but maybe the product is FeS or another sulfide? Wait, no, when you have metals reacting with sulfur... Oh, wait, maybe A is a metal, and B is sulfur gas. So 8 equivalents of sulfur (B is S8, perhaps) reacting with A (maybe a metal like iron) to form a sulfide. But wait, iron sulfide is usually black, like FeS. Wait, but A is solid, B is gas. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, B is chlorine gas? No, that would form chlorides which are usually white. Hmm.

Wait another thought: when a metal like iron reacts with chlorine, it forms FeCl3. But that's not bright red. Alternatively, sulfur is S8, a bright yellow solid, but in the reaction, B is a gas. So maybe B is Cl2? No, Cl2 is a gas, but reaction with metals would form chlorides. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 if A is something that forms a bright red oxide. Wait, some metal oxides are red. Like maybe CuO is black, but Fe2O3 is reddish. Oh, wait, Fe₂O₃ is reddish, like rust. So if A is iron and B is oxygen, but the reaction is between a solid metal and a gas (oxygen), then product C could be Fe₂O₃. But wait, the stoichiometry here: 8 equivalents of B. Let me think about the reaction.

If A is Fe and B is O2, the reaction is 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe₂O₃. So 3 equivalents of O2. But in the problem, 8 equivalents are used. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe B is another diatomic gas. Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is Cl2. Then, the reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But that's white, not red. Alternatively, maybe A is aluminum and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal and B is sulfur. Let's think: Metal sulfides. For example, FeS is black, CuS might be black too. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal reacting with another gas. Wait, another idea: Maybe A is copper metal and B is sulfur vapor. The reaction would produce CuS, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like lead, and B is another gas. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's look
