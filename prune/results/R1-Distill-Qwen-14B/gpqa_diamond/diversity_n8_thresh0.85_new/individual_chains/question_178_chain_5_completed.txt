Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So this must be some kind of interaction term between the Dirac spinor fields and maybe a gauge field, since F is the field strength tensor, which usually appears in electromagnetism or Yang-Mills theories.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must be dimensionless because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) must be dimensionless. Wait, no, the Lagrangian density itself has to have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over a four-dimensional spacetime volume (which is dimensionless), the integrand must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} should have dimension 4.

Let me break down each component:

- ψ is a Dirac spinor. I think each Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1 (since it's like ∂/∂x^μ, and x has dimension -1 if mass is positive). So the term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimension [γ matrices are dimensionless, ∂ is 1, ψ is whatever. So 1 + [ψ] = [ψ] +1? Wait, no. Wait, the term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ would have dimension equal to [∂_μ] + [ψ]. Since ∂_μ has dimension 1, and ψ is a spinor, which I think has dimension 3/2. So 1 + 3/2 = 5/2. But the mass term is mψ, which must have the same dimension as the kinetic term. So [m] + [ψ] = [∂_μ ψ], which is [ψ] = 3/2. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of γ matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is (3/2) * 2 = 3. Because ψ̄ has 3/2 and ψ has 3/2, multiplied together gives 3.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1. Because the field strength is like ∂ A, which is dimension 1 (since A is 1) plus 1 (from the derivative), so F has dimension 2. Wait, no: wait, the derivative has dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂ A, which is dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) which is dimension 3, multiplied by F which is dimension 2. So the entire term has dimension 3 + 2 = 5. We need the term to have dimension 4 because the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So κ must have dimension 4 - 5 = -1.

So [κ]_M = -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. In four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling has positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling κ is [κ] = d. The theory is renormalizable if d ≥ 0. Wait, actually, I remember that the superficial degree of divergence is determined by the dimension of the coupling. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, let's think about how renormalizability is determined. In a theory with interaction term L ~ g φ^n, the coupling g has a certain mass dimension, and the theory is renormalizable if the dimension is ≤ d (d being the spacetime dimension, which is 4 here). Wait, no: the condition is that the coupling g must have a mass dimension of at least 0. Because the coupling's dimension tells us about the possible divergences. If [g] is positive, the theory is renormalizable; if it's negative, it's nonrenormalizable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the formula. In four dimensions, a coupling constant g in a term g φ^m has a mass dimension [g] = d - ( (d-2) * (m-1) ) / 2. Wait, maybe I should use the general approach.

In general, for a term in the Lagrangian like g O, where O is some operator with dimension Δ, the dimension of g is [g] = 4 - Δ, because the term g O must have dimension 4 (since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 in four dimensions). So if [g] is positive, the theory is renormalizable; if [g] is negative, the theory is nonrenormalizable.

In our case, the interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So let's compute the dimension of the operator ψ̄ σ ψ F. As above, ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3, F has dimension 2. So the operator's dimension is 3 + 2 =5. So [g] = [κ] =4 -5= -1. So [κ]=-1.

Since the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is nonrenormalizable. Because for renormalizability, the coupling must have a non-negative mass dimension. In 4 dimensions, a coupling with [g] >0 is allowed, [g]=0 is marginal (super-renormalizable?), and [g]<0 is nonrenormalizable.

So the theory is nonrenormalizable.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: [k]= -1, renormalizable. No, because the theory can't be renormalizable if [k] is negative.

Option C: [k]=-1, theory not renormalizable. Yes, that fits.

Option D: [k]=1, not ren. Then the [k] would be positive but theory not ren. Not the case here.

So the correct answer is option C: [k]=-1 and theory not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Each term in the Lagrangian must also have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the components of the interaction term:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) and \( \psi \) are Dirac spinors, each with mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless, as it is constructed from the commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices.
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor, which has mass dimension 2 (since it is proportional to derivatives of the gauge field, and the gauge field has dimension 1).

The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) has mass dimension:
\[
\text{Dimension of } \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi = \text{Dimension of } \bar{\psi} + \text{Dimension of } \psi = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
Including \( F^{\mu\nu} \), the total dimension of the term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) is:
\[
\text{Dimension of } \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must compensate for the excess dimension:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension (\( [\kappa]_M \geq 0 \)). In this case, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) has a mass dimension of \( -1 \), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory cannot be renormalizable with a negative coupling dimension.
- **Option B**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the calculated dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), not \( 1 \).
- **Option C**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as explained above.
- **Option D**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), not \( 1 \).

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.

**Answer: C**
