Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through this.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give different possible answers for the relative speed and total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is different. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). Wait, but wait—since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, right? Or do I add them? Wait, no. Let me think. If astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, both in the same direction, then the relative speed of A with respect to B would be u - v, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, wait. Relativity adds speeds when they're in different frames. So if you have two objects moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't simply subtracted. So I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Because the velocity addition formula when moving in the same direction is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is the velocity of A, v is the velocity of B. Wait, but wait: in this scenario, each astronaut is in their own frame, right? Or are they in the same frame?

Wait, the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So one is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.5c, how fast is the other moving? So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, so about 0.14c. That makes sense. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's good.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. Wait, but wait: each has a rest mass, but their energies are each gamma * m_i c^2, where m_i is their rest mass.

Wait, the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So their energies would be gamma1 * 2m c² and gamma2 * 3m c².

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36)) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

The second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Wait, sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660, so 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547.

So energy2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So close to 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options: option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So that's the correct one.

Wait, let me double-check the relative speed calculation. So (0.6c - 0.5c) is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Oh, that's 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 0.7. So 0.1 / 0.7 is 1/7 ≈ 0.1428, so 0.14c. Yes, that's correct.

So the answer must be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \(v = 0.5c\) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
