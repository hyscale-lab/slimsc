Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is involved in some kind of ring-closing metathesis, but wait, maybe it's used for other things too. Oh right, Grubbs is also used for olefin metathesis, which can involve breaking and reforming double bonds.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. So first, I should probably draw the structure of that. Let's see, pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2-CH3? No wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent means five carbons. Numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a 3-methyl group. So at position 3, which is the third carbon from the double bond. So the structure should be:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait, pent has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would put a methyl on the third carbon. So the
