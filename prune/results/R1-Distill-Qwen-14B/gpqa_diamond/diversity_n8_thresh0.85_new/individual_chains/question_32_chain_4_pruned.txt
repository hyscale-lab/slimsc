Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when it accelerates a certain nucleus to 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The common isotopes are like Li-6 and Li-7. Since it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be Li-7 because Li has 3 protons normally (since atomic number 3 is Li), and 3 neutrons would make the mass number 6? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait: Li has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 +3 =6. So it's Li-6. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me double-check. Isotopes are defined by the number of neutrons. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Li-7 has 4 neutrons. So the question says the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Another point: the question is about the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions. So the energy per ion or per nucleon? I think RHIC typically gives the energy per ion, so the total energy per nucleus.

So the problem is to find the total energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c. Because relativistic speeds, we need to use relativistic equations.

First, let's find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons, but wait, ions have a charge. Li has 3 protons. So Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and no electrons because it's a nucleus (it's positively charged). So the mass is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons.

Wait, but wait. The exact mass of the nucleus is a bit tricky because of binding energy, but for high school or basic physics problems, we often approximate using the sum of the individual masses. But wait, no, wait, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum because of the binding energy (E=mc², so mass deficit). Alternatively, in particle physics, sometimes we use the atomic mass unit and the mass of the nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, we're supposed to model the nucleus as having a rest mass equal to the sum of the individual protons and neutrons.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the atomic mass. The mass of the Li-6 atom is known, but since it's a nucleus, we can find the mass of the nucleus by subtracting the mass of the electrons. But wait, Li has 3 electrons per atom. So the nucleus's mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass of the nucleus as roughly the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons. Let me think about the numbers.

Mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². Neutron is slightly heavier, about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6: 3 protons + 3 neutrons.

So let's compute that. Each proton is 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = let's compute:

Protons: 3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
Neutrons: 3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's the sum of the individual masses. But the actual mass of the nucleus is less because of binding energy. So the actual rest
