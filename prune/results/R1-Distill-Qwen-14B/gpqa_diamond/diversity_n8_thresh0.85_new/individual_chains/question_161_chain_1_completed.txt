--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, so the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with a 1000 kV accelerating voltage. He's got vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr. But some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike measures the mean free path as λ1, considering factors like volume, pressure, and temp.

Wait, mean free path. Right, that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions in a gas. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), or something like that. Or wait, maybe it's λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and P is pressure. Alternatively, another formula I've seen is λ = (3/√2) * (k*T)/(π*d²*P) ), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, but the key here is that when the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The question is asking why λ2 is different.

So without the beam, the mean free path is λ1. But when the beam is on, does the presence of the electrons affect the gas? Oh, right! The electron beam can cause ionization of the gas molecules. Because high-energy electrons (like 1000 kV is 1 MeV, which is pretty high) will interact with the gas atoms, knocking electrons off or exciting them. So the gas molecules might become charged—ions.

Now, ions behave differently in a vacuum. In a vacuum, the gas molecules (neutral) have certain mean free paths determined by their collisions. But when they become ions, they can experience electric fields. Wait, but the electron beam itself is a source of an electric field. Or maybe not, because the beam is moving so fast and is focused. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, the ions might have different collision rates.

Wait, another angle: when the gas is neutral, their mean free path is λ1. When the gas is ionized, perhaps their behavior changes. Ions can be more easily deflected by the electric fields in the microscope's columns, but I'm not sure that affects the mean free path directly.

Wait, but in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized. So the mean free path is determined by the collisions between the gas molecules themselves, but if they're ionized, maybe their effective cross-section for collisions changes. Alternatively, the presence of charged particles might lead to additional interactions, like Coulomb forces between the ions and the electron beam, or between ions themselves.

Wait, but the mean free path is about the average distance between collisions. So when a gas is neutral, collisions are between neutral molecules. When some are ionized, maybe the collision cross-section changes. Alternatively, maybe the ions are less likely to collide because they're charged, so the mean free path would be longer. Or the opposite?

Wait, no, because if some molecules become ions, the number of neutral molecules decreases. But the collision process between neutral gas molecules is what determines λ1. When some are ions, perhaps the collision rate between the remaining neutral molecules is the same, so λ remains λ1. But that doesn't explain why λ2 would change.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes more frequent ionization, so the gas density effectively increases because the ions are being created and perhaps not pumped out as quickly. Wait, but the pressure is already ultra-high vacuum, so the pumps must be working. But the electron beam could affect the gas in another way.

Wait, think about the physics. The mean free path in a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square of the mean collision diameter, and directly proportional to the temperature. So, all else equal, if pressure changes, the mean free path changes.

But in this scenario, the sample compartment's temperature is the same. So the pressure is the same because the pumps are presumably working. Unless the electron beam is somehow causing a change in pressure.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to be knocked out of the compartment via the beam's interaction. Because high-energy electrons can impart enough energy to the gas molecules to overcome the vacuum's hold, perhaps via the gas being ionized and then accelerated out of the system. So the effective pressure might decrease, which would increase the mean free path.

Wait, but wait—the question says that the mean free path was measured by Mike as λ1 before the beam was on. Then, when the beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2. So if the pressure is lower when the beam is on, then λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But wait, how? If the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be removed, then the pressure would drop, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But the options are about λ2 compared to λ1. So the answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. Looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

Hmm, but why would it be >= 1.22 times? Maybe because the mean free path formula includes a factor of sqrt(2) or similar. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, the mean free path equation is: λ = 1/(n * σ * sqrt(2)), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter. So if the pressure decreases (because some gas is being removed), then λ increases.

But in the scenario, the beam is causing more gas to leave, so pressure is lower. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22*λ1, option D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1, and C is λ2 < λ1.

So why would λ2 be exactly 1.22 times λ1? Or more?

Alternatively, maybe because when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions have a longer mean free path. Because the ion's mean free path isn't affected the same way as neutral molecules. Wait, no. Or perhaps because the ions are being repelled or attracted by the electric fields in the electron beam, which may cause them to move away, reducing the effective density of the gas in the beam path. So the gas in the region of the electron beam has a lower density, leading to a longer mean free path for the gas molecules.

Wait, so in the sample compartment, without the beam, the gas is at pressure P, so λ1 = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). But when the beam is on, the gas in the beam path is more ionized. Now, if the ionized gas molecules (ions) are deflected away from the beam path, the density of gas in that area decreases. So the local pressure in that area is lower, so the mean free path for the gas molecules in the beam path is longer. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But why would it be exactly 1.22 times? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the mean free path increases because the ions are charged and their collisions are less frequent. Wait, no, charged particles would have different collision rates. Or perhaps, the ions have a longer mean free path because they interact differently with the vacuum chamber walls? Or maybe because the ionization reduces the number of collisions as charged particles might be more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces, thus reducing the effective number in the gas phase, leading to a longer mean free path.

Another angle: the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, and the ions are then extracted from the chamber, perhaps by the electric fields in the beam or due to pumping. So the effective number of gas particles in the chamber decreases, leading to a lower pressure, which increases the mean free path.

Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is already under 1e-9 Torr, so how much lower can it get? Even if the beam causes a slight drop in pressure, the mean free path would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

So given the options, the only options where λ2 is larger than λ1 are A and D. Option B says λ2 equals λ1, which wouldn't make sense if the beam is causing changes. Option C is λ2 smaller, which would be if the beam somehow increases the pressure or decreases the temperature, but that's not the case here.

So between A and D, which say λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 and λ2 in between λ1 and 1.22*λ1.

Wait, why 1.22 times? Oh, wait, the mean free path equation can sometimes have a factor involving sqrt(2), but perhaps in another context. Alternatively, when gas is ionized, the collision cross-section changes. The collision cross-section σ for ions might be different than for neutral molecules.

Wait, but if the gas is fully ionized, then the collision cross-section might be zero because ions might not collide in the same way as neutral molecules. But that can't be right because in reality, ions can still collide.

Wait, perhaps the presence of ions increases the mean free path compared to neutral molecules because they have different collision dynamics. Alternatively, maybe the presence of charged particles allows them to be accelerated away, reducing the effective density in the beam path, thus increasing the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions are accelerated out of the system. So the number of gas particles in the beam's path is reduced, thus the mean free path for the remaining gas is longer. So the mean free path increases.

So λ2 is greater than λ1.

Now, the question is, how much larger is λ2 than λ1?

Looking back at the problem statement, the initial scenario says that Mike accurately determined the mean free path to be λ1. So λ1 is the value under the ultra-high vacuum conditions without the beam.

When the beam is on, the presence of the beam leads to ionization of some gas molecules. The ions may be accelerated away from the sample compartment, perhaps through the ion extraction process or due to electric fields. This would effectively reduce the number density of gas in the compartment, leading to a lower pressure.

Wait, but if the pressure is lower, then the mean free path becomes longer. So λ2 = λ1 * (P1 / P2). Since P2 is lower than P1, λ2 is larger than λ1.

But the question is, by how much?

Wait, but the problem states that the mean free path when the beam is on is λ2. So the question is whether λ2 is greater or less than λ1.

So according to the analysis, λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking back at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1 (so no change, but the observation is that it's changed, so B is unlikely)

C) λ2 < λ1 (opposite of what we think)

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1

Wait, so why would it be option D or A?

The mean free path equation is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P). So λ is inversely proportional to pressure.

If the pressure in the compartment when the beam is on is lower than P, then λ2 would be higher.

But how much lower is P? It depends on how much gas is being removed when the beam is on.

If the beam removes some gas, the pressure decreases. The question is, by how much?

In the absence of the beam, the pressure is P, so λ1 = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π d² P).

When the beam is on, the pressure is P', which is less than P.

So λ2 = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π d² P') = λ1 * (P / P').

Since P' < P, λ2 > λ1.

But the question is, how would λ2 compare to λ1? For example, if half the gas is removed, then P' = P/2, so λ2 = 2 λ1.

But the options don't have 2λ1 as an option. So perhaps the way the question is framed, the mean free path is dominated by another effect.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be scattered by the electrons. So the mean free path in terms of electron scattering could be different.

Wait, but wait, the question says that Mike observed a change in the mean free path based on the electron scattering. That's a bit confusing. Or perhaps he measured the mean free path of the gas molecules, but under the influence of the electron beam, their mean free path changes.

Alternatively, maybe the mean free path of the electrons is changing, but no, the question is about the gas molecules.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized, and the ions have a longer mean free path than the neutral molecules. Because ions can be more easily accelerated away, so their mean free path increases.

Wait, but the mean free path for the gas molecules (assuming they're all neutral) was λ1. Now, with the beam on, some are ionized. The ionized gas would have a different behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the neutral gas remains the same, but the ionized gas's mean free path is longer. But how does that affect the overall mean free path?

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas has a longer mean free path because the ionization reduces the number of collisions, as ions might not collide as often as neutral molecules. Or maybe the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces, reducing their contribution to collisions.

Wait, if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral molecules decreases, so the mean free path for the remaining neutral molecules would increase, as n decreases. Because λ is inversely proportional to n (number density). So if n goes down, λ goes up.

Wait, but how much does n decrease? If the ionization removes some of the gas, then n decreases, leading to longer λ.

But without knowing the exact change in n, we can't say for sure whether λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1 or significantly larger.

But looking back at the options, the options are about a factor of 1.22. I think this number comes from the factor of sqrt(2) in the mean free path formula. Let me think about that.

The mean free path formula is λ = 1/(n σ √2), where σ is the collision cross-section. So if the cross-section changes, the mean free path changes.

Wait, but under what circumstances would the cross-section σ change?

If the gas is ionized, the cross-section for collisions could be different. For example, ions might have a smaller cross-section because their charge affects how they interact. Alternatively, if the ions have a larger cross-section, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps when the gas is neutral, the mean free path is λ1. When some of the gas is ionized, the neutral molecules have the same cross-section, but the number of neutral molecules is lower. Wait, no, because the number of collisions would be between neutral molecules. If some are ions, they don't contribute to collisions between neutral molecules.

Wait, maybe the number of neutral gas molecules is the same, but the presence of ions causes additional scattering or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the temperature locally, but the question states that the compartment's temperature remains the same.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes partially ionized, creating positive ions. In ultra-high vacuum, these ions can have a longer mean free path because the chamber's walls are far away. So the ions might not collide as often, leading to a longer mean free path.

But wait, the mean free path is about the gas molecules (neutral) colliding with each other. If the electrons are causing some of them to become ions, which don't collide as much, but the neutral molecules are still the same, their mean free path remains λ1.

Wait, no, because the presence of ions could affect the neutral molecules' motion. Maybe ions create an electric field that affects the neutral molecules, changing their mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are more massive, so when they collide with neutral molecules, it doesn't contribute much to the mean free path. But this is getting complicated.

Another approach: the mean free path is determined by the gas's properties and the pressure. If the pressure is the same, but the gas is ionized, then perhaps the mean free path doesn't change. But in reality, ionized gas (plasma) has different behavior.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path changes when the beam is on. So the presence of the beam must be causing a change in either the pressure or the gas's properties.

Wait, perhaps when the beam is on, the gas is heated. But the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Alternatively, the beam could cause gas molecules to be removed from the system, either by being ionized and accelerated out, or by being ejected due to the energy imparted.

If the number of gas molecules decreases, the pressure decreases, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 > λ1.

So which option says that?

Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Option D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

But why 1.22?

Wait, wait, perhaps the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure. So if the pressure is lower by a factor, say, 0.8, then the mean free path would be higher by 1/0.8 = 1.25, which is about 1.22 or close.

But why would the pressure be lower by a factor that leads to λ2 being 1.22x λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes an increase in the mean free path, but not by a huge factor. So λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1.

But without knowing the exact factor, the options don't give exact numbers except option A, which is >=1.22.

But the question is, what can we conclude about λ2? Since the presence of the beam causes some gas to leave, the mean free path must increase. So λ2 is greater than λ1.

So the options are A and D. But the question is, which is it? Is λ2 significantly larger (A) or just a little larger (D)?

Wait, perhaps the effect is not that big. Because the vacuum is already ultra-high, at <1e-9 Torr. So even if some gas is removed by the beam, the pressure might not drop by a huge factor. So maybe λ2 is a little larger than λ1 but not more than 1.22 times.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is exactly a factor of sqrt(2), which is about 1.414, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options say 1.22 is the lower limit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the mean free path increases when the beam is on because the gas density decreases. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, only options A and D fit that.

But the problem states that Mike found that λ2 was no longer equal to λ1. So the options are whether λ2 is greater or less than λ1.

The correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so options A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, can we decide between A and D?

The question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. But when the beam is on, the gas is ionized, and perhaps the ions are less likely to collide, so their mean free path is longer.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas (neutral molecules) would be unchanged, because the number of neutral molecules and the conditions (like pressure, temperature) are the same. Unless the ionization changes the effective pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the beam is on, the mean free path of the electrons is changing, but the question is about the gas molecules.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think in terms of physics principles.

In the absence of the beam, the gas is neutral, and the mean free path is λ1. With the beam on, the gas is partially ionized. The mean free path of the neutral gas would remain the same, as their collisions are only with other neutral molecules.

But wait, the presence of ions could influence the motion of the neutral gas. For example, ions could exert an electric field, or perhaps the ions would cause additional scattering for the neutral molecules.

Alternatively, considering that ions are charged, and the electron beam is high-energy, perhaps the ions are being repelled or attracted, leading them to leave the beam area. That reduces the number of ions and neutral gas in the beam area, so the effective density in that region is lower, leading to a longer mean free path for the gas in that region, making λ2 larger than λ1.

So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Therefore, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the correct options are A or D.

But why would option A say λ2 >= 1.22λ1?

Hmm. Maybe because when the gas is ionized, the mean free path formula includes a different factor.

Wait, the mean free path formula for a gas is λ = (k*T) / (√2 * π * d² * P). So if the pressure P decreases, λ increases.

Assuming that the pressure decreases by a certain factor, perhaps the pressure becomes P' = P / 1.22, which would make λ2 = 1.22 λ1.

But why would the pressure decrease by 1/1.22? Because of the electron beam's effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the mean free path to increase by a factor of sqrt(2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the 1.22 factor could relate to the ionization process. For example, if the ionization reduces the effective number of collisions, the mean free path increases by a factor.

But without knowing the exact reason, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so either option A or D is correct.

But looking at the options, option C says λ2 is less than λ1, which contradicts our conclusion. So it's not C.

Option B says λ2 equals λ1, but Mike observed a change, so B is incorrect.

So the options are A or D.

But the question says that the compartment's temperature remains the same. So it's all about pressure.

If the beam causes the pressure to decrease, then λ2 increases. But how much?

If the pressure drops by a factor of 1/1.22, then λ2 = 1.22 λ1, which is option A. If the pressure drops by a smaller factor, λ2 would be between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, making option D correct.

But without knowing the exact pressure change, we can't be certain. However, the question says Mike accurately measured λ1, but upon initiating the beam, the mean free path became λ2. The options ask what we can conclude.

The only conclusion possible is that λ2 > λ1. So the correct options are A or D.

But the options don't offer a clear indication of how much it has changed. But the options A and D are the possible ones.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure, but wait, the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure (since λ ~ 1/P). So if the pressure decreases, λ increases.

Wait, if the pressure was initially P, and then drops to P', then λ2 = λ1 * (P / P').

So for example, if P' is 0.8 P, λ2 is 1.25 λ1, which is just over 1.22.

But if the pressure doesn't change much, λ2 would be just a little larger than λ1.

But in an ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is already so low that a small change in pressure could lead to a significant change in λ.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is small, making λ2 slightly larger than λ1, so option D is correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: in a vacuum, when you have a beam, the gas can be ionized, and the ions are then extracted from the system, effectively lowering the pressure. So the mean free path increases.

But how much does the pressure drop?

Suppose that the electron beam causes a significant number of gas molecules to be ionized and pumped out. If the number of gas molecules decreases by, say, 20%, then the pressure would drop by 20%, leading to λ2 = 1/(0.8) λ1 = 1.25 λ1, which is just over 1.22.

So that would make option A correct.

But if the pressure drops by less than that, say 10%, then λ2 would be 1.11 λ1, which is in option D.

But without knowing the exact fraction, it's hard to say. However, the question is a multiple-choice, and the options are about the possible conclusion.

The correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So options A and D are possible. But the question is about what we can conclude.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is influenced by the presence of the beam in a way that doesn't involve pressure changes. For example, when the beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions have a longer mean free path because they're charged and interact differently. So the mean free path of the ions could be longer than that of the neutral gas.

But the question refers to the mean free path of the gas molecules in the vacuum, which are mostly neutral, but some are ions now.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam increases the effective temperature, but the question says the temperature remains the same.

Hmm, perhaps the right approach is to think that when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized, and the mean free path for the remaining neutral molecules increases because the number of collisions between neutral molecules is the same, but the overall density is lower, leading to a longer mean free path.

But I'm stuck between options A and D.

Wait, the question says that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1. So λ2 is different, but whether it's longer or shorter.

In the scenario, the presence of the electron beam leads to more gas molecules being ionized and possibly removed from the compartment. Thus, the pressure would drop, so λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer must be A or D.

But I'm not sure which. Maybe I should think about the options.

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Option D: λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1.

So if the pressure drops by, say, 20%, making λ2 = 1.25 λ1, which is above 1.22, then A would be correct.

If the pressure drops by 10%, λ2 is 1.11 λ1, which is less than 1.22, so D is correct.

But without knowing how much the pressure changes, perhaps the best conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct options are A or D.

But the question is a bit tricky. I think the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct options are A or D.

Wait, the question says that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1, but Mike was expecting some gas to remain. The presence of the beam causes gas to be ionized, but perhaps the ionization doesn't change the mean free path as much as the physical removal of gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the ions have a longer mean free path, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The mean free path is given by λ = L/(n*L), where L is something else. Wait, no, the formula is λ = 1/(n σ √2), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section.

If the presence of the electron beam causes ionization, which reduces the number of neutral molecules (n decreases), then λ increases.

So λ2 > λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Therefore, the correct options are A or D.

But the options also specify the possible magnitude. The question is about what can we conclude.

If the beam's effect is to reduce the pressure, but not by a huge factor, then λ2 would be a little larger than λ1, so option D.

But since the initial pressure is already ultra-low, the mean free path is already long. The effect of the beam might be a small change, making λ2 just a bit larger than λ1, which would fit option D.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the correct answer is C, but that would mean λ2 is less than λ1, which doesn't make sense because the pressure would be lower, so λ increases.

No, that's not right. So the only options are A and D.

Given that, and considering that the beam might cause a noticeable but not large change, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is that the mean free path increases, but not by a significant factor. So the answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not very confident. Another approach: the mean free path depends on the presence of particles. If the beam causes more particles to be removed, the mean free path increases. So λ2 is larger. So the answer is either A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, the best I can do is to choose the option that says λ2 is larger than λ1. So the options are A and D.

The question gives us four options, and from the reasoning, the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking back, the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So the correct answer must be either A or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, because when the electron beam is on, the gas is more ionized, which reduces the number of collisions between neutral molecules, thereby increasing the mean free path by a significant factor.

But I'm still not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path just increases a bit, so D is correct.

But I think the intended answer is C, but that can't be because the mean free path should increase. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. So, if the pressure decreases, the mean free path increases. Wait, no, the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, not the square root.

Wait, the formula λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P).

So λ is proportional to 1/P.

Therefore, if P' is the new pressure, then λ2 = λ1 * (P / P').

So if P' is lower than P, λ2 is larger.

But how much lower is P'?

If the pressure is reduced by a factor, say, 0.8, then λ2 is 1.25 λ1.

Which is more than 1.22, so option A would apply.

But if the pressure only drops by 0.9, λ2 is 1.11 λ1, which is option D.

So without knowing the exact factor, it's unclear.

But the problem states that Mike accurately determined λ1, but upon initiating the beam, the mean free path became λ2. How much has it changed?

Perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, but the options don't give a 'greater than' without a factor. So the options are A and D.

But the possible conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking at the options, the only ones that fit are A and D.

But the question says 'what can we conclude about λ2'?

So perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Among the options, A and D fit.

But without more information, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1, which is option A.

Wait, but why 1.22? That number is approximately sqrt(1.5), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a factor from another formula. For instance, sometimes in mean free path calculations, the factor of sqrt(2) comes into play, so perhaps the change leads to λ2 being sqrt(2) times λ1, which is about 1.414. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that would imply λ2 is less than λ1, which contradicts the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

When the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized, and the ions are accelerated away. So the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, which reduces the pressure. Lower pressure means longer mean free path.

So yes, λ2 is larger than λ1.

Therefore, the correct options are A or D.

But since the options don't specify exactly how much, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct option is A or D.

But the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C. Wait, why? Because when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas becomes more dense in some regions, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path decreases because the ions are more likely to scatter the electrons, but that wouldn't affect the gas's mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective temperature, but the question states the temperature remains the same.

I think I'm stuck. My best guess is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct answer is either A or D.

But since option A says >=1.22 λ1, and if the pressure drops by 20%, λ2 would be 1.25 λ1, which is above 1.22, making option A correct.

Therefore, the answer is A.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike observed a change in the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment upon initiating the electron beam. Initially, the mean free path was measured as $\lambda_1$ under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, when the electron beam was turned on, the mean free path changed to $\lambda_2$. The key factors influencing this change are as follows:

1. **Mean Free Path Basics**: The mean free path $\lambda$ is inversely proportional to the pressure $P$ and depends on factors such as temperature $T$, collision diameter $d$, and number density $n$. The formula is approximately $\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}$.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**: When the electron beam is activated, high-energy electrons interact with gas molecules, causing ionization. This ionization can lead to the removal of gas molecules from the compartment, either by being accelerated away or pumped out. As a result, the effective pressure in the compartment decreases.

3. **Pressure and Mean Free Path Relationship**: Since $\lambda \propto \frac{1}{P}$, a decrease in pressure due to the removal of gas molecules increases the mean free path. Thus, $\lambda_2 > \lambda_1$.

4. **Magnitude of the Change**: The question specifies that $\lambda_2$ is no longer equal to $\lambda_1$, but the exact factor by which $\lambda_2$ increases is not provided. If the pressure decreases by a factor of $0.8$, $\lambda_2$ would increase by approximately $1.25$, which is just above $1.22$. This aligns with option A, which states $\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1$. If the pressure decreases by a smaller factor, $\lambda_2$ would fall between $\lambda_1$ and $1.22 \lambda_1$, corresponding to option D.

5. **Eliminating Other Options**: 
   - Option B ($\lambda_2 = \lambda_1$) is incorrect because Mike explicitly observed a change in the mean free path.
   - Option C ($\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$) contradicts the reasoning, as a decrease in pressure increases the mean free path.

Given the reasoning above, the most plausible conclusion is that $\lambda_2$ is greater than $\lambda_1$, and the factor of $1.22$ in option A is consistent with the expected change in pressure and mean free path.
