Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So, the scenario is that Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 1e-9 Torr, which is really low. But despite that, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. So if pressure is lower, the mean free path should be longer.

Then Mike starts the electron beam. He notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, which is not the same as λ1. But the temperature is the same, so that's not the factor here. What's different when the electron beam is on?

Oh, wait! When the electron beam is active, it's producing a high-energy electron flux. Those electrons can interact with the gas molecules. I think this could cause some sort of effect on the gas. Maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize? So, the gas molecules become charged particles.

In a vacuum, charged particles (ions) behave differently than neutral ones. Because they're charged, they might interact more with the electron beam or the walls of the chamber. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels without colliding with others. If the gas is neutral, they don't interact much with each other. But if they become charged, do they start to attract or repel each other more? Or maybe the ions stick to the walls or other surfaces, which would reduce the number of gas particles in the compartment.

Ah, right! When gas molecules are ionized, they can be more easily captured by the walls of the chamber. Because the vacuum is so good, but the chamber surfaces can act like plates in a capacitor. High-energy electrons can cause molecules to lose or gain electrons (ionization), making them charged. Charged particles are more likely to stick to the walls because of electrostatic forces. So, more ions are lost from the gas phase.

If the number of gas molecules decreases due to ionization and sticking to the walls, the pressure effectively goes down. Because pressure is proportional to the number of particles (from the ideal gas law), lower pressure would lead to a longer mean free path. So λ2 should be greater than λ1.

Wait, but the sample compartment's temperature remains the same. Let me think again. Mean free path formula: λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). Since T is same, if P decreases (because some molecules are lost due to ionization and sticking), λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

But looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1, which suggests a significant increase. Option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be if the pressure went up, which doesn't make sense here.

Wait, but another angle: when the electron beam is on, maybe the ions are being accelerated or influenced by the beam, moving faster. But wait, the mean free path is about molecular collisions, so higher speed would mean a shorter path before collision. But wait, if they're ionized, perhaps their movement is more constrained. Or maybe the ions are being pushed away, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas molecules have a different cross-sectional area for collisions. If they're ions, maybe their effective size changes. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, but let me think about the effect of ionization on the gas. Ionized gas (plasma) behavior is different from neutral gas. In a plasma, the mean free path might be shorter because charged particles can interact through electromagnetic forces, not just collisions. Or wait, perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, so the
