Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (which is denoted as plx) changes with plx. The options are all different power laws, like 1 over plx to some exponent.

Hmm, I think parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance d in parsecs. So plx = 1/d.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So I guess it's like, how many stars do you see when you look at a range of parallax values. And how does that count change as plx changes.

So if stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their distances are uniformly distributed in some way. But wait, uniform distribution in what sense? In terms of volume? Because in 3D space, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on the volume up to that distance.

Wait, let's think about this. Suppose the stars are uniformly distributed in space, which means the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Then, the number of stars at a certain distance depends on the volume up to that distance.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πd³. So if the number density is n stars per cubic parsec, the number of stars within distance d is n*(4/3 π d³). But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx.

Wait, so the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx would be the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d = 1/plx, with thickness dd = ... Hmm, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to model this.

The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume of a spherical shell between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. Because the volume between d and d+dd is like the surface area (4π d²) multiplied by the thickness dd.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd. But we want the number per unit parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. To find how many stars are in a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, we need to express the number in terms of plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx would be (n * 4π d²) / dplx, but wait, what's d in terms of plx? d = 1/plx. So d² is (1/plx)^2.

But also, we need to find how dplx relates to dd. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative of d with respect to plx: dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So dd = -dplx/(plx^2). Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases, so maybe the negative sign just takes care of the direction, but for the purposes of the number, we can consider the magnitude.

So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is n * 4π d² dd. But dd = |d (dplx)| = dplx/(plx^2) because d = 1/plx.

Wait, let me correct that. Let me think in terms of plx. So when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dd = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx.

d = 1/plx. So derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = -dplx/(plx²). But since we're considering a small positive change in plx, d decreases, so the thickness in terms of d would be negative. But for the number of stars, we take the absolute value.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is n * 4π
