Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with NMR spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's start by figuring out the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, it's Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens here, but the formula doesn't have any. So plugging in the numbers: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So 2*8 +2 = 18. Minus H (9) and plus N (1) gives 18-9+1=10. Divide by 2, 5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturation. That would be, for example, a benzene ring (which is 3 degreesâ€”three double bonds or one ring plus two double bonds) plus some other double bonds or rings. Or maybe a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, which is another double bond. Let's see.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm, the peaks. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, integrating to 1H. That seems like an aldehyde proton, because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be that downfield, but the triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, aldehyde is typically a singlet, but sometimes if it's adjacent to something, maybe it could show coupling? Or maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenol? But phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm, unless something's deprotonating them. Wait, but the other options have multiple O's. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO, so it's one N and one O. Wait, wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So that's 8 carbons, 9
