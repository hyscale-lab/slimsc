Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, the standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be Li-6. Because 3 protons +3 neutrons equals 6. So, the nucleus has a mass number A of 6, right?

So, the problem is to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed v of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations because classical mechanics won't work here.

The first thing I think about is the relativistic energy of a particle. The total energy E is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, E = gamma * m c².

But wait, the nucleus is moving, so its kinetic energy is a part of the total energy. Oh, wait, no. The problem is about the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the total energy each nucleus has, not just the kinetic part. Or does it? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So I think they're asking for the total energy each nucleus has when moving at v=0.96c. So that would be the relativistic energy E = gamma * m c².

So first, let's compute gamma for v=0.96c. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)). Plugging in v=0.96c, we have:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)
= 1 / sqrt(0.0784)
What's sqrt(0.0784)? Let me think, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28=0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). One atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So the mass m is 6 u.

Calculating m: 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg
= 9.9632344e-27 kg.

Now, c is
