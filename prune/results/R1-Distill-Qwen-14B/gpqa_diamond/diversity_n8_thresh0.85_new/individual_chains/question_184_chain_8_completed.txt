Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, benzene is a ring, so numbering might be tricky. Let me visualize it. The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, it's a meta arrangement.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the order in which substituents are added matters because each substituent directs the next substitution. Also, activating and deactivating groups influence where the next substituent comes in.

So, I need to think about the order of adding these groups. Let's consider each substituent:

1. tert-Butyl: This is a strong activating group (alkyl group) which is ortho/para directing.
2. Ethoxy: Another activating group (electron-donating via O-), so it's ortho/para directing as well.
3. Nitro: A strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So, if I add nitro last, it might complicate things, but if I add it earlier, it would deactive the ring, making other substitutions harder.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added after some other groups that can direct it properly.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so when adding a nitro group, the directing would depend on the existing substituents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced in a position where the other substituents are already present and can direct it appropriately.

Wait, but the target has all three substituents. So, the order of adding substituents is crucial because each new group affects where the next one attaches.

Let me think about the possible steps.

I think the nitro group is likely the first to be added because it's deactivating, making the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions, but wait, that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, adding a nitro group after activating groups could be tricky because the ring might not be activated enough.

Wait, benzene is a good starting point. Let's think about introducing substituents in an order that allows each step to direct the next correctly.

I remember that nitration is a common first step. Let me consider that.

Option D starts with nitration. So, if I nitrate benzene, I get nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps add the tert-butyl group next, but wait, nitro is deactivating and meta-directing. So if I have nitro on benzene, adding an activating group (like tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts) would require that the tert-butyl goes in a position that's ortho or para to the nitro. But since nitro is meta-directing, the next group would come in the meta position relative to it. Hmm.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3) is for activating the ring. If the ring is already deactivated (like with nitro), the Friedel-Crafts might not work because they require an activated ring. So, perhaps adding nitro after the other groups might be better because the ring is activated when Friedel-Crafts is done.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts can't be done on a deactivated ring. So, if the first step is nitrating benzene, getting nitro group, then trying to add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult because nitro is deactivating. So that might not work.

So perhaps the nitro group is added later. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we first add activating groups, which direct the next substitution, then add the nitro group in the correct position.

So, first, perhaps introduce the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so it's ortho/para-directing. If I first add ethoxy, then the next substitution (tert-butyl) would be directed by ethoxy.

Wait, let me outline possible steps:

1. Benzene → nitrate? Maybe not first, because then Friedel-Crafts would be hard. Alternatively, add ethoxy first.

Wait, how do you add ethoxy to benzene? That's via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but benzene is not very reactive. Alternatively, ethoxy group can be introduced via a diazonium salt coupling, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, like using a nitration, then some directing, then another group.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each substituent and their introduction.

The ethoxy group is an activating group. So perhaps it's introduced via a substitution reaction, but benzene doesn't undergo substitution easily. Alternatively, maybe it's added via a Friedel-Crafts alkoxylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts doesn't work with alkoxy groups because oxygen is more electronegative and the AlCl3 would react with the alcohol.

Wait, another way to introduce ethoxy is via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires the ring to be activated towards that. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, like using a vinyl group or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions.

Looking at the target molecule, perhaps the nitro group is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in 2. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering depends on the substituents.

But regardless, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But then, when adding the nitro group, the existing groups should direct it to the correct position.

Wait, another approach is to use the directing effects of the substituents.

Let me try to plan the synthesis:

Step 1: Introduce ethoxy group. How? Well, one way is to first nitrate benzene, then reduce the nitro group to amine, then perform some reaction to substitute it with ethoxy. That might involve multiple steps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a Friedel-Crafts alkylation but that's for alkyl groups. Wait, ethoxy is an ether group, so maybe it's introduced via a substitution. Hmm, perhaps not straightforward.

Wait, maybe ethoxy is introduced as a side reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after another substituent is already present. For example, if we first add a tert-butyl group, then ethoxy, then nitro. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has an activating group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each step in the options.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine? Fe/HCl is a typical reduction for nitro groups, but under acidic conditions. Wait, nitrobenzene with Fe/HCl (maybe H2SO4) gives phenylamine? Or does it form a diazonium salt?

Wait, maybe step ii is nitration followed by a reduction. But let me think: If I have nitrobenzene, then I add Fe and HCl. Wait, Fe/HCl is a way to reduce nitro groups to amines, but in acidic conditions, perhaps to form a diazonium salt, but that usually requires lower temperatures.

Wait, another thought: maybe after nitration, they're doing a sulfonation or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me look for the steps that would build the substituents correctly.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, nitro.

Suppose the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification. How? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's not straightforward for benzene.

Wait, perhaps using a vinyl group and then a substitution, but that's complicated.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after activating the ring. Let me think about the steps.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using a nitration as the directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: first, nitrate benzene, then introduce ethoxy, then introduce tert-butyl, but I'm not sure about the feasibility.

Wait, another approach: think about the substituents in the target.

The substituents are at positions 1,2,3. Let's assume that the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, when adding substituents, the order must allow each new substituent to be added in the correct position.

Let me think about the order of adding substituents.

Option: let's first add tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But after tert-butyl (an activating group, ortho/para), adding ethoxy would go in ortho or para to it.

Then, when adding nitro (deactivating, meta), the nitro would be added in a position directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but in reality, each substitution is directed by the strongest or most activating group.

Wait, perhaps the first substituent is the tert-butyl group. Let's say we do Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using t-butyl chloride and AlCl3) on benzene. That gives tert-butylbenzene. Then, we add ethoxy group, which is an activating group, so it can be added in the ortho or para position relative to the t-butyl group.

But wait, how do you add ethoxy to benzene? Friedel-Crafts doesn't work for ethers. Maybe via a substitution. Alternatively, maybe you introduce a nitro group, then reduce it to an amino group, then substitute with ethoxy.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps.

Option: 

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Then, introduce nitro group in the para position relative to tert-butyl (since t-butyl is ortho/para directing). So nitration would add nitro in para position. Now, the molecule is 4-nitro-t-butylbenzene.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy group. Wait, but nitro is meta-directing, so the ethoxy would go in the meta position relative to nitro, which might not be where we want it.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding tert-butyl and nitro, we can introduce ethoxy. But this may not lead to the right positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group first.

2. Then add nitro group.

3. Then add t-butyl.

But how to add ethoxy to benzene? Maybe via benzene sulfonic acid, but that's another story.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a nitro group. Wait, but that's not feasible.

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group has been added. Let's say, nitrate benzene, then substitute nitro with ethoxy. But that would require a good leaving group, which nitro isn't.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reaction, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, each one has a series of steps. Let me see which option has the steps that would lead to the correct substitution pattern.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So nitrobenzene becomes phenylamine? Or perhaps make a diazonium salt.

Wait, if you have nitrobenzene and treat it with Fe and HCl (like in a diazotization?), but usually diazotization requires low temperatures (like 0-5°C) and uses NaNO2 and HCl. Fe/HCl is more for reductions. So, maybe step ii is reducing nitro to amino. So nitrobenzene → phenylamine.

Then, step iii: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, phenylamine is a strong activating group (NH2 is ortho/para directing, but it's a strong activating group, so perhaps we can perform Friedel-Crafts on it.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts can't be done on amines because the ring is already activated. Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires activating groups, but amines are very activating. However, the presence of amino groups can make the ring too reactive, leading to side reactions. Alternatively, perhaps after reducing nitro to amino, add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but after reduction, the ring has an amino group. So, when performing Friedel-Crafts, the tert-butyl would add in positions ortho or para to the amino group.

So, benzene → nitro → amine → alkylation.

But the target has nitro in position 3. So perhaps after adding t-butyl and ethoxy, the nitro is in the correct position.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit lost. Let's think about each step in option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → phenylamine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → adds tert-butyl group in ortho/para to NH2. So, the substituents would be NH2 and t-butyl in ortho or para.

iv) Nitrate again → so now adding a second nitro group. Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. Hmm, perhaps option D is not the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is a nitration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has only one nitro group. So option D's step iv would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm, so perhaps option D is not correct.

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts add t-butyl to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the benzene ring. Since t-butyl is ortho/para directing, nitro would add in ortho or para.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine? Or perhaps another reaction.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again? But target has only one nitro.

Hmm, maybe not.

Option A:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add t-butyl to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro in ortho/para to t-butyl.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis? Maybe to form a phenol?

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → possible hydrolysis of a nitro group? Not sure.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, but I'm not sure.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction?

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

This seems complicated and may not lead to the correct substitution.

Option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Sulfonic acid is a strong activating group, ortho/para.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate, which would go ortho/para to sulfonic acid.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this is not the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a way to activate the ring for further substitution.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so option C may not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a sulfonic acid group as a directing group, then substituting it later.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Let's think about the positions.

The target has 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro.

So, let's number the ring as follows:

Positions 1: ethoxy.

Position 2: t-butyl.

Position 3: nitro.

So, substituents are at 1,2,3.

Now, when adding substituents, each new group must be directed by the existing groups.

Let me outline a possible synthesis:

1. First, introduce the ethoxy group. But how? Perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that might not give an ethoxy directly.

Alternatively, maybe using a coupling reaction. Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be strongly activated, perhaps with a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

a) Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

b) Reduce nitro group to amine (using Fe/HCl), giving phenylamine.

c) Substitute the amine group with ethoxy. But how?

Wait, perhaps using a diazonium salt. Let me think:

Phenylamine → diazonium salt (using NaNO2 and HCl, cold) → then treated with ethanol (as a nucleophile) to substitute the amino group with ethoxy.

Wait, does that work? Diazonium salts can be used for substitution reactions. So, if I have phenylamine, I can convert it to benzene diazonium chloride, then substitute with ethanol to get benzene ethoxy.

Wait, but is that feasible? Let me think. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like substitution with a nucleophile. So, if you have a diazonium salt and you add ethanol (with H+ and heat?), perhaps you can substitute the N2+ group with OEt.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about this step. Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe introducing the ethoxy group via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible because it's an ether. So, perhaps using a different method.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been activated by another group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group via a substitution reaction, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the tert-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then add the ethoxy group via a substitution (but I'm not sure how).

3. Then add the nitro group in the correct position.

But again, step 2 is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the ethoxy and t-butyl, but that would require the ring to be activated, which is difficult with nitro.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced last, after activating groups are present to direct it.

So, the steps could be:

1. Add ethoxy group (activating, ortho/para).

2. Add tert-butyl group (activating, ortho/para).

3. Add nitro group, which is deactivating and meta, but directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but after steps 1 and 2, the ring has two activating groups. The nitration would be directed by the most activating group or the one that's in position to direct it.

But in this case, ethoxy is a stronger activating group (electron-donating via lone pairs) than alkyl groups. So, perhaps the nitration is directed by the ethoxy group.

So, if ethoxy is in position 1, then the nitro would be added in the meta position relative to ethoxy, which would be position 4, but that's not what the target has. Hmm.

Wait, the target has nitro in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy in position 1, but also in a certain relation to the tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene.

2. Add nitro group in meta to ethoxy.

3. Then add tert-butyl in ortho to nitro?

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so after adding nitro, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult because the ring is deactivated.

Hmm, perhaps that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add nitro group in meta to tert-butyl.

3. Then add ethoxy group in ortho to nitro.

But wait, after nitro (deactivating), adding ethoxy via substitution would be difficult.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which sequence logically adds the substituents correctly.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → phenylamine.

iii) Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → since phenylamine is a strong activating group, the alkyl group would add in ortho/para.

Then, iv) nitrate again? That would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

So option D probably isn't correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitrate → nitro in ortho or para.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitrate again → another nitro, not good.

So option B isn't correct.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate → SO3 group.

iii) nitrate → nitro in ortho/para to SO3.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) nitrate again? Hmm, not sure.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis?

viii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution.

This seems complicated, but perhaps the substitution is for introducing the ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe after several steps, the substituents are added in a way that leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, another approach: look for the presence of steps that introduce the ethoxy group.

Looking at option B:

vi) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, but I'm not sure what is being reacted here.

Looking at option D:

vii) dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat → maybe acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → could be an SN2 substitution, perhaps substituting a leaving group with ethoxy.

So, for example, if there's a good leaving group like a tosylate or a sulfate ester, then NaOH and ethyl bromide could perform an SN2 substitution.

But how would that leave group form?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a diazonium salt, which is then substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, the steps in option D include:

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-butyl.

Then steps iv) nitrate again, which would add another nitro group which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group, but that's not feasible. So maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring is activated by a strong activating group.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy group via a substitution, which requires the ring to be activated.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reaction, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after making a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe after forming a nitro group, which is a poor leaving group, but perhaps with some activation, like through sulfonation.

Hmm.

I think I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the correct order of adding substituents.

The target has substituents at 1,2,3 positions. Let me imagine that the ethoxy is added first, then t-butyl, then nitro, but directed by the ethoxy.

Wait, but ethoxy is a strong activating group. So, adding nitro after ethoxy would direct it to the meta position.

So:

1. Add ethoxy to benzene.

2. Nitrate the ethoxy benzene → nitro in meta to ethoxy.

3. Then add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, which would need to be in a position directed by the ethoxy and nitro.

But after nitration, the ring has a nitro group (deactivating, meta) and an ethoxy group (activating, ortho/para). The Friedel-Crafts (AlCl3) would require an activated ring, but nitro deactivates it. So maybe Friedel-Crafts can't be done after nitration.

Hmm, maybe this approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add ethoxy via substitution, but how?

3. Then add nitro, which would be directed by the ethoxy.

But again, the substitution step is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution using a tosylate or similar leaving group.

But how to get that group on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after a nitro group is present. Let me think:

Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

Then, nitro is reduced to amine → phenylamine.

Then, phenylamine is treated with something to substitute NH2 with OEt.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, perhaps using a diazonium salt and substitution. So, phenylamine is converted to a diazonium salt, which then reacts with ethanol to substitute the amino group with ethoxy.

That could work.

So, steps would be:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro.

ii) Reduce nitro to amino → NH2.

iii) Diazotize (NaNO2, HCl, cold) → diazonium chloride.

iv) Substitute with ethanol → OEt.

Then, add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but after substituting with OEt, the ring has an ethoxy group, which is activating, so Friedel-Crafts can proceed.

So, after ethoxy:

v) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → adds t-butyl in ortho/para to ethoxy.

Then, add nitro group in meta to ethoxy.

Wait, but after adding t-butyl, the ring has two activating groups (ethoxy and t-butyl), so the next substitution (nitro) would be directed by the strongest activating group, which is ethoxy.

So nitro would go meta to ethoxy, which is position 3.

So, this seems to fit the target structure.

So the steps would be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amino → phenylamine.

3. Diazotize → benzene diazonium chloride.

4. Substitute with ethanol → 1-ethoxybenzene (phenetole).

5. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl in ortho or para to ethoxy.

Wait, but after ethoxy is in position 1, adding t-butyl in position 2 (ortho) would be possible.

Then, nitrate the ring. Now, with ethoxy in 1 and t-butyl in 2, where would the nitro group go?

Wait, the ethoxy is a stronger activating group, so nitration would be directed by ethoxy. So, meta to ethoxy is position 4, but the target has nitro in position 3.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy in position 1, the t-butyl is added in position 2 (ortho), then nitration in position 3 (meta to ethoxy? Or para to t-butyl?).

Wait, when you have two substituents, the directing can be a bit complicated. The nitration would be influenced by both substituents.

But ethoxy is a stronger activating group than t-butyl, so it would direct the nitro group to its meta position, which would be position 4, not 3.

Hmm, so this approach may not yield the desired product.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → phenylamine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → adds t-butyl in ortho/para to amine.

iv) Nitrate again → adds another nitro group, which isn't desired.

So option D probably isn't correct.

Option C:

i) t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate → sulfonic acid group (strongly activating, ortho/para).

iii) HNO3 → nitrate. Now, nitro would be in ortho/para to sulfonic acid.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

This seems like it's adding more substituents than needed.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this might not be the correct path.

Option B:

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Again, adding another nitro group, which isn't desired.

Option A:

i) t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

ii) nitrate → nitro in ortho/para.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotize.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → possible hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the target has nitro in position 3. Let me think about how that position can be achieved.

If one substituent is in position 1 (ethoxy), and another in position 2 (t-butyl), then nitro in 3 would be meta to ethoxy and para to t-butyl.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, the nitration would need to be directed to position 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, and then the ethoxy and t-butyl are added in positions directed by the nitro.

But nitro is deactivating, making it hard to add substituents via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, unless the nitro group is meta to where the next substituent can be added.

Hmm, perhaps the order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce ethoxy via substitution. But how?

Wait, perhaps using the amine reduction method.

Then, steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Diazotize to form diazonium chloride.

iv) Substitute with ethanol → ethoxy group.

Then, add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, which would add in ortho/para to ethoxy.

Finally, add nitro again? No, that's not desired.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that option D is the correct one.

Wait, another thought: looking at option D, after adding t-butyl, you nitrate again. But that would add a second nitro group, which isn't in the target. So option D can't be correct.

Looking back, perhaps option D is not the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) nitrate → nitro in ortho/para to sulfonate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) nitrate again → unclear.

Hmm, not making much sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

First, add ethoxy group via substitution, then nitro, then t-butyl.

But how to add ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option D.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps are:

i) nitrate → nitro.

ii) reduce nitro to amine.

iii) add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts in para to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro.

But target has only one nitro, so this can't be correct.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added last, directed by the ethoxy and t-butyl groups.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl.

3. Nitrate, which is directed by ethoxy to position 3.

But how to add ethoxy.

Perhaps, using a diazonium salt substitution.

Wait, let's think of the steps in option B.

Option B:

i) t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

ii) nitrate → nitro in ortho/para.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro.

No, that's adding two nitros.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitro.

ii) reduce to amine.

iii) add t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → ortho to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro? Not desired.

No, that's not correct.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to outline the synthesis again.

The target has:

- ethoxy in position 1.

- t-butyl in position 2.

- nitro in position 3.

So, after adding ethoxy in 1, t-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3.

But how to add the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a nitro group.

But that would require the nitro group to be a good leaving group, which it isn't. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a better leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is first converted to a nitroso group, which can leave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is sulfonylated to become a better leaving group, but that's not standard.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the steps that would lead to the correct substituents in the correct positions.

After considering all possibilities, perhaps the correct option is D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has the nitro group at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and para to t-butyl (position 2). So, when nitro is added after ethoxy and t-butyl, it must be directed by one of them.

But if ethoxy is present, it's a strong activating group, so the nitro would be added meta to it, which is position 4, not 3. Hmm, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added in a position that is ortho to t-butyl and meta to ethoxy. But how?

Wait, perhaps the t-butyl is added after the nitro and ethoxy. But that would require the ring to be activated for Friedel-Crafts, which would be difficult if nitro is present.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the options, the correct sequence would involve adding the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts first, then adding nitro, then ethoxy via some substitution.

Wait, looking at option D again:

i) Nitrate.

ii) Reduce to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts t-butyl → adds in ortho or para to amine.

iv) nitrate again → another nitro.

Not helpful.

So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the right one.

Wait, another thought: the ethoxy group could be introduced via a coupling reaction after the ring has a nitro group, but that requires specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group, but that's not feasible.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time, and I'll have to make a choice. Based on the analysis, I think option D is the correct one, but I'm not fully confident.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each step. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The order of addition of these groups is critical because each substituent influences the position of subsequent substitutions.

### Key Considerations:
1. **tert-Butyl Group**: This is an activating, ortho/para-directing group introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. **Ethoxy Group**: This is an activating, ortho/para-directing group, but its introduction is less straightforward due to the challenges of directly substituting ether groups onto benzene.
3. **Nitro Group**: This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Introducing it early would deactivate the ring, making subsequent Friedel-Crafts reactions difficult.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- **Sequence**: 
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Sulfonation.
  4. Diazotization.
  5. Hydrolysis.
  6. Acid workup.
  7. SN2 substitution.
  8. Reduction.
  9. Nitration.
- **Issues**: The sequence introduces multiple substituents but does not clearly lead to the desired substitution pattern. The nitro group is added multiple times, which is not consistent with the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
- **Sequence**: 
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Nitration.
  3. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  4. Nitration.
- **Issues**: The nitro group is added twice, which is not desired. Additionally, the sequence does not clearly establish the ethoxy group in position 1.

#### **Option C**:
- **Sequence**: 
  1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  2. Sulfonation.
  3. Nitration.
  4. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  5. Diazotization.
  6. Nitration.
  7. Acid workup.
  8. Dilute H2SO4.
  9. SN2 substitution.
- **Issues**: The sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group (SO3) as an intermediate, which is not present in the target molecule. This makes the sequence unlikely to yield the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
- **Sequence**: 
  1. Nitration.
  2. Reduction of nitro to amine.
  3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride.
  4. Nitration.
- **Issues**: The nitro group is added twice, which is not desired. Additionally, the sequence does not clearly establish the ethoxy group in position 1.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the desired substitution pattern. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** appears to be the most plausible, despite the issue of adding the nitro group twice. This conclusion is made with some uncertainty, as the exact steps for introducing the ethoxy group remain unclear.

**Answer: D**
