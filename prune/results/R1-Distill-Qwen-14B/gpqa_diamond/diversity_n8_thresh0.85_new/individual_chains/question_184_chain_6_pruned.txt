Okay, I need to figure out which reaction sequence will give me 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let's break it down.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3, so they're all adjacent. Wait, wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. Let me think: if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's ortho and meta relationships. Wait, the actual structure might have 1-nitro, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-ethoxy? Or maybe I should number them differently. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in such a way that they're all meta or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the positions based on the substituents. The nitro group is a strong meta-directing group. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, deactivating (because it's an alkyl group, which is activating but maybe here it's just bulky) but actually wait, tert-butyl is an alkyl group, so it's activating, but it's bulky so it might direct ortho and para, but in reality, bulky groups tend to direct more to para because of steric hindrance. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the tert-butyl group is a meta director. No, no, alkyl groups are ortho/para directors because they're activating. But their bulk might affect where substitution occurs.

But the main point here is to plan the synthesis steps. So starting with benzene, I need to introduce three substituents. Nitration, ethoxylation, and tert-butyl group introduction.

But the problem is about the sequence of reactions. The key is that the order of introducing substituents affects the positions they end up in because each substituent directs the next substitution.

Let me think about the order of adding these groups.

Optionally, the first substituent might be the nitro group because it's a strong meta director. If I add nitro first, the next substituents will go into certain positions.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification, which is typically done via a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps using a Williamson synthesis. But benzene isn't directly nucleophilic, so we use some kind of electrophilic substitution.

Wait, for the ethoxy group, perhaps we can introduce a hydroxyl group first, then perform an alkylation. But wait, benzene can't be directly alkylated; we need to make a phenol first. So maybe we would do nitration, then sulfonation, then something else. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Alternatively, the tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent. Friedel-Crafts alkylation is one way to introduce that, but Friedel-Crafts doesn't work if the ring is already strongly deactivating. So if I introduce nitro groups early, Friedel-Crafts might not work anymore because nitro is deactivating. So perhaps the order is important.

Wait, let me think step by step.

The target molecule has nitro (NO2), ethoxy (OEt), and tert-butyl groups. So three substituents on the benzene ring.

Let me plan the order of addition.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Using Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene is activating enough for Friedel-Crafts. So add tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 as catalyst. It would add as a substituent. Then, after that, maybe nitrate. But where would the nitro group go? The tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director, but it's bulky, so maybe the nitro group would go para to it. Then, after nitration, add ethoxy.

Wait, but ethoxylation needs to be done via some substitution. Let me think: benzene can't be directly converted to ethoxybenzene unless we have a directing group. Maybe we can do a sulfonation first to activate the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: Add substituents in the order that allows each new group to be added with the correct directing. Let me think.

Wait, another plan: Maybe the nitro group is added last, because nitro is a meta director, so to control the positions, perhaps adding it last.

Let me outline a possible sequence.

First, introduce the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts. Then, introduce the ethoxy group, and then nitrate.

But wait, the nitration is a strong meta director. So let's see.

After adding tert-butyl, when we nitrate, the nitro group would enter in the meta position relative to tert-butyl.

Wait, but then when we add ethoxy, where does it go? Let's plan this step.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after nitration. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then introduce the tert-butyl, then ethoxy. Or another way.

Alternatively, let me think about the steps in each option and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, nitro group is added. Where? The tert-butyl is a strong ortho/para director, but bulky. So nitro would add preferably to the para position, but maybe ortho is hindered. So nitration would give para-nitrotoluene analog. But wait, in this case, the ring has a tert-butyl group, so the positions available are ortho, meta, para to that group.

Wait, but since tert-butyl is bulky, the nitration would likely occur para to it. So nitration step adds nitro at para.

Then, iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is introduced. Where? Sulfonation is directed by the substituents. The ring has tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta).

But wait, which group is more directing? The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So when sulfonating, the incoming SO3H would go meta to nitro. But I'm not sure since the ring has two substituents now. It's possible that the nitro group is more influential, so the sulfonic acid group goes meta to nitro.

Then, iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Wait, but where? This step is typically after nitration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a step for a different purpose.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option D would be better.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → HCl with Fe, which is used in the reduction of nitro groups. Wait, but reduction of nitro to amine? But why would that be done? Nitrobenzene to phenylamine?

But then, iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts. But wait, nitro is a deactivating group. Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating ring. Nitrobenzene is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So step iii) would fail. So option D's step iii is Friedel-Crafts on nitrobenzene, which probably won't happen. So D is unlikely.

So option D is probably incorrect.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. As before, nitro group would add para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But that doesn't make sense since we have a nitro group. Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, Fe/HCl is often used in the Sandmeyer reaction or for diazonium salts. Alternatively, maybe it’s used to reduce nitro to amine.

Wait, if you have nitrobenzene and treat it with Fe and HCl, you get aniline. So in step iii of option B, they have Fe/HCl, which would reduce the nitro group to amine.

But then, why would you do that? Because if you have an amine, you can perform other reactions, like alkylation or acetylation. But in the target molecule, we have a nitro group. So perhaps this step is not correct.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group, so maybe this step is not the way to go. So option B's step iii reduces nitro to amine, but target requires nitro
