Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize what's needed. The molecule is benzene with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be adjacent positions. Let me make sure I get the positions right. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they're all meta to each other? No, wait. Benzene has ortho, meta, para positions. So if the ethoxy is at position 1, then the nitro is at position 3 (which is meta to ethoxy), and tert-butyl is at position 2 (which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro). Hmm, but wait, am I numbering correctly? Or maybe the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 as in adjacent to each other. That would make them all ortho and meta in a row.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So positions 1: ethoxy, 2: tert-butyl, 3: nitro. So that's positions 1, 2, and 3 all adjacent to each other. So ethoxy is at position 1, then moving clockwise, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

So the substituents are in adjacent positions, which suggests that they might have been introduced via some directed substitution, perhaps using activating groups.

Benzene is the starting material. So I need to think about how to add these groups in the correct order.

The substituents are a nitro group, a tert-butyl group, and an ethoxy group. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para), and tert-butyl is a bulky group, which is a weakly activating, but also directs ortho/para.

Wait, but the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, which are all adjacent. So maybe the first substitution is ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl? Hmm, but the order matters for directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first. Let me think about each substituent and their directing effects.

Nitro is meta-directing. Ethoxy is ortho/para. tert-Butyl is bulky, but also ortho/para-directing. So the order in which substituents are added will determine the positions of the other substituents.

The target has three substituents in a row, so we need to figure out
