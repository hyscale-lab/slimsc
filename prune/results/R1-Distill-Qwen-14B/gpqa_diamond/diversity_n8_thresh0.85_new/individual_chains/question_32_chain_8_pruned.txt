Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach 0.96c speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's try to work through this.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the isotope would be Li-6 because Li usually has 3 protons and if it has 3 neutrons, that's 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, the question is about finding the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So I think this is about relativistic energy. Oh right, the total energy of a particle is gamma times m c squared. But wait, I need to relate this to the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because sometimes these problems can be tricky about whether they're asking for total energy or just the kinetic part.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed...". RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy they're referring to is probably the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the formulae.

In special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma * m c². The kinetic energy K is E - m c², which is (gamma - 1) m c². So if the question is about the energy of the collider, I think it refers to the kinetic energy given to each ion. Because the collider's energy specifications are usually given in terms of kinetic energy per particle.

But wait, sometimes people refer to the total energy when talking about collider energy. So I'm not entirely sure. Hmm. Well, maybe I can proceed and see which option fits.

So, first, let's find the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. So the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. The mass of Li-6 is 6 u. So m = 6 * u.

Wait, but sometimes particles in colliders are accelerated to a certain speed, and their kinetic energy is a significant fraction of their rest mass energy. So let's compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that. v is 0.96c.

So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28² is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Let's compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. Let me do that: 96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784
