--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see, the question is about reaction sequences and determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. Hmm, I remember symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, like whether they're tetrahedral, octahedral, etc., and the point groups they belong to.

Alright, let's break down the reactions step by step. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. The product is bright red, so that gives me a hint. I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur reacting with oxygen? Wait, but sulfur is bright yellow, not red. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Another thought: maybe it's a transition metal compound. Like, perhaps copper reacting with something. But copper oxide is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: product C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4. Weak acids are like H2O or CH3COOH. So maybe the reaction of C with water produces a strong acid and a weak one. Like, if C is a sulfide, maybe reacting with water to form H2S and something else? Or perhaps it's a nitride? No, that might form NH3 which is a weak base, not an acid. Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, maybe it's a metal carbonate which upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid like H2SO4 (if the metal is sulfur?) Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate, but that's more of a salt.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is produced when C reacts with D. What's D? Let's see, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like that. But B is a gas. So B and D in 1:1 ratio form a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, earlier, when C reacts with water, it gives A and two acids. So maybe C is a metal sulfide? Like CuS? No, but if C is CuO, and when it reacts with water, it might not produce acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. Let's think: if C is, say, PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is dark brown, but that doesn't fit the red color. Alternatively, could it be something like Fe2O3? No, that's reddish, but maybe that's C?

Wait, another thought: when A reacts with B to form C. If B is a diatomic gas like O2, then perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide. For example, if A is Fe, and B is O2, then Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO or Fe3O4. But Fe3O4 is black, not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur, B is O2. Sulfur burning in O2 gives SO2 or SO3, which are gases, but C is a solid. So not that.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is sodium, B is Cl2. Sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl, which is a solid. That's white, not red. Hmm.

Wait, the product when C reacts with water gives A, F, and G. Suppose C is something like a nitride. Wait, but nitrides would react with water to give NH3 and metal hydroxides. But F is a strong acid and G a weak acid. So maybe not.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide. Let's say A is a metal, and when it reacts with B (maybe O2), it forms an oxide, C. Then when C is treated with D (another gas) to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Oh, wait, if C is Fe3O4, reacting with Cl2 might form FeCl3, but I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that when reacted with D, forms a highly dangerous substance, like sarin gas or something, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another angle: D is a gas that reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Solvents include things like ethanol (but that's a liquid), water (but B is a gas, so maybe D is H2O and B is something else?), or maybe D is CO2 and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then they would form H2O. But H2O is a solvent, so that fits. So B is O2, D is H2. Then, in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So A is a metal that reacts with O2 in a 8:1 molar ratio? Wait, for example, maybe A is aluminum, which reacts with O2 in a 4:3 ratio, but not 8:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Suppose D is another gas, like H2. Then B and D reacting in 1:1 would be Cl2 and H2 reacting to form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe D is NH3. But NH3 is a gas, and B could be something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: C reacting with D (2 equivalents) produces E. E is extremely hazardous. So perhaps E is a gas like phosgene, or a nerve agent, but more likely it's a common chemical. Another thought: E could be a highly toxic gas like HCN, but how would C and D produce that?

Alternatively, maybe E is H2SO4, but that's not a gas. Wait, perhaps E is a gas like NO2, which is red-brown, but that's a possibility.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. A + 8 B → C. So 8 equivalents. So 8 moles of B per mole of A. That might suggest that B is a diatomic gas, and each A molecule takes 8 B atoms. For example, if B is O2, then each A might combine with 8 O atoms. That would imply a formula like A O4, perhaps. Wait, for example, if A is Fe, then FeO4^2- is not common, but Fe3O4 is iron(II,III) oxide, which is a mix of FeO and Fe3O4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, and B is O2. Then, S reacting with O2 gives SO3, which is a liquid or gas. But wait, SO3 is a gas but more commonly a liquid. Plus, SO3 isn't bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal that forms a sulfide. So, A (metal) + B (sulfur vapor) → C (metal sulfide). But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide, which is red. Like, perhaps CuO is black, but maybe some other oxide. Wait, lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal compound. For example, maybe it's a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe chromium(VI) is orange.

Wait, perhaps C is lead(IV) oxide, PbO2, which is dark brown. But the product is bright red, so maybe it's Pb3O4, which is reddish. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3, which is reddish. Oh, that's possible. Fe2O3 is reddish, but the color may vary. So if A is iron, B is O2, then 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. But in the question, 8 equivalents of B. Wait, in the reaction, 8 equivalents of B per A. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B. So, for Fe, 4 Fe would react with 3 O2, so the ratio is 3/4 per Fe. Hmm, not matching 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur, and B is something else. Sulfur (A) reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. So S (solid) + 8 B → C. If B is O2, then S + O2 → SO3. But SO3 is a gas, but C is a solid. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Then S + Cl2 → SCl2 or SCl4. But SCl2 is a liquid, and SCl4 is a solid. Maybe that's possible. So C would be SCl4, which is a solid. But then what happens when C reacts with D?

Wait, another angle: when C is reacted with H2O, it produces A, F, and G. So for example, if C is a sulfide, like CuS, then reacting with water might produce H2S (acid F?), but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, but F is a strong acid and G a weak acid. So perhaps C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. Then reacting with water (H2O) wouldn't do much. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then reacting with water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, but F is a strong acid. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. If C is Na2SO4, then reacting with water wouldn't give acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is Al2O3. Reacting with water might not give much, unless it's a high temperature. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal hydroxide, but that doesn't make sense as it's formed from A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with water might not do much, but perhaps with acid? Wait, no, the question says C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So if C is CaCO3, and it reacts with H2O, perhaps under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the other reactions. D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, B and D reacting 1:1 to make a solvent. Let's think of possible solvents: H2O, ethanol, methanol, etc. But B is a gas. So, if B is O2, then D could be H2, making H2O. But H2O is a solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, D could be H2, making HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). Or B is O2 and D is C (solid carbon?), but that would form CO or CO2. If D is C, which is a solid, but the question says D is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is O2 and D is H2. They react in 1:1 ratio to form H2O, which is a solvent. So that fits. So D is H2 gas, B is O2.

So in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2 in an 8:1 ratio. Let's see, perhaps A is Fe. Let's think about the reaction:

4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3.

In this case, for 4 Fe, 3 O2 are used, so the ratio is 3/4. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum. 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So for 4 Al, 3 O2 used. Again, not 8 equivalents.

Wait, wait. Maybe the reaction is A + 8 O2 → C. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are consumed. So perhaps A is a metal with a valency that requires 8 O2 per A. Let's see:

If A is a metal with a valency of +4, then each O is -2, so each A would need 2 O2 (since 4 O atoms). Hmm, not 8 O2.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal with a higher valency. For example, if each A is +8, then maybe it forms AO4? But that's rare. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal with a higher oxidation state.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. For example, S (sulfur) reacting with O2 to form SO3. The reaction is S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. So for 1 S, 3 O2 are used. Not 8. Hmm.

Another approach: when C is reacted with D (H2 gas) in a 2:1 ratio to form E. So C + 2 H2 → E. E is extremely hazardous.

Wait, if C is Fe3O4, and reacting with H2, that's a reduction reaction. Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. But that's not a product that's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that, when reacted with H2, produces a metal and water. But E would be the metal, which might not be extremely hazardous.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a compound that when reacted with H2 (D), forms a highly toxic gas. For example, if C is a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a metal and water. But that's not giving a dangerous product. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, and D is H2. Then FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. H2S is a toxic gas. So E could be H2S, which is dangerous. But the reaction of FeS with H2 would require some conditions, maybe high temperature.

Wait, but in the reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2) to produce E. So if C is FeS, and D is H2, then the reaction would be FeS + H2 → Fe + H2S. The ratio is 1:1, but the question says 2 equivalents of D. So perhaps another stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacting with H2 might not do much, unless under high heat, producing CO2 and H2O. But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous.

Wait, another possibility: E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but how would that form from C and H2? Maybe if C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Si3N4, and reacts with H2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the reactions. Let me think about the symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are point groups. D∞h is the symmetry of a diatomic molecule with an infinite axis, like O2 or H2. D4h is a higher symmetry, like a square planar or octahedral structure. C2v is a two-fold axis with vertical mirrors, like water (H2O) or ammonia (NH3).

Wait, but E is a product of the reaction of C with D. So what's E's structure? If E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or H2, but those are the starting materials. Alternatively, maybe E is something like HCl, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but in the reaction C reacts with D (H2) to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So if E is HCl, it's a gas, but not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Or perhaps E is H2S, which is toxic.

Wait, but if C is a metal sulfide and reacts with H2, perhaps E is H2S gas. H2S is a molecule with a structure of H-S-H, which is bent, so its point group is C2v. So the symmetry group would be C2v.

Wait, but let's check the options. Option D is C2v. So maybe the answer is D.

Alternatively, let me recap. The possible E is H2S. H2S has a bent structure, so the point group is C2v. So the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But wait, another possibility: if E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or H2, their symmetry group is D∞h (option C). But in that case, E would be O2 or H2, which are the reactants. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, which is a bent molecule, so its symmetry group is C2v. But how would E form from C and H2? I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to form A and two acids F and G. If F is a strong acid and G a weak one. Let's say F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak). So C could be a sulfate and carbonate? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, suppose C is a metal sulfide. When it reacts with water, it gives H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But metal hydroxides aren't acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: C could be a metal oxide. For example, if C is CaO, reacting with water gives Ca(OH)2 and releases heat. But that's not producing acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (acidic gas). But the question says F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide? No, that doesn't make sense as it's formed from A and B.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate, like Fe2(SO4)3. Reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck on what C is. Let's try a different approach. Let's think about the possible structure of E.

If E is H2S, then its point group is C2v. Because H2S has a central S atom with two H atoms attached, making a bent structure. The symmetry operations include a C2 axis (180-degree rotation), a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis, and inversion. So yes, C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2, the symmetry is D∞h. But O2 is one of the reactants, so I don't think E is O2.

Another possibility: E is a triatomic molecule like SO3, but that's a trigonal pyramidal structure with C3v symmetry, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, but if E is something like HCN (which is a linear molecule, so D∞h symmetry), but how would it form from C and D?

Alternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule like CH4, its symmetry is Td, which isn't an option.

Wait, given the options, and the possible structures, E being H2S would have C2v symmetry, which is option D. Another possibility is if E is a molecule with D4h symmetry, but I can't think of any that would form under these conditions.

Wait, another angle: if E is a linear molecule like CO2, its symmetry is D∞h, which is option C. But how would CO2 form from C and H2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry (option D). But how would that form from C and H2?

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let's say C is FeO. Then, reacting with H2 (D) would produce Fe and H2O (E). So E is H2O, which has C2v symmetry. That would fit. So the reaction would be FeO + H2 → Fe + H2O. But then, why would C react with water to form A (Fe), F and G (acids)?

Wait, if C is FeO, then FeO + H2O → Fe(OH)2, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit the condition where F and G are acids.

Hmm, maybe C is a sulfate, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reactions again.

A + 8 B → C (bright red solid)
C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

D + B → H (solvent, 1:1)

Assuming B is O2 and D is H2:

A + 8 O2 → C (bright red)
C + 2 H2 → E
C + H2O → A + F + G

So, in the third reaction, when C reacts with water, it gives back A, and two acids. So maybe C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it forms a metal hydroxide, but that's a base. But F and G are acids, so perhaps C is a carbonate or a sulfide.

Wait, if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide, like FeS. Then, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. H2S is a weak acid, but Fe(OH)2 is a base. So F would be H2S (weak acid), and G would be something else. Hmm, not matching because we have two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce a strong acid and a weak acid. But metal oxides typically form bases, not acids. Unless it's a non-metal oxide. For example, SO3 is an acid anhydride. But SO3 is a gas, not a solid.

Wait, if C is a metal sulfate, but that doesn't help either.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed oxide. For example, Pb3O4 is a mixed oxide of lead, but I'm not sure about its reaction with water.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. Reacting with water might not do much, but perhaps under acidic conditions? But the reaction is with water, not acid.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about E's structure. The options are about symmetry groups.

If E's molecular symmetry is D∞h, it would be a linear molecule like O2, H2, CO2, etc. But O2 and H2 are the reactants, not products. CO2 is a possibility, but how would it form?

Wait, if C is CO2, but that doesn't fit because C is a solid formed from A and O2. Not sure.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a starting material as B, perhaps. So E can't be Cl2.

Wait, another thought: E is a molecule like HCl, which is linear, so D∞h. But how? If C is something that reacts with H2 to produce HCl. But that would require C to be Cl-based, which doesn't fit earlier steps.

Alternatively, E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry. So if E is SO2, the symmetry group is C2v, option D.

But how would that form? If C reacts with H2 to form SO2, which would imply C is a sulfur compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3, which is a triatomic molecule with C2v symmetry. But O3 is not formed from H2 and another compound.

Wait, let's think about E as H2S. Structure is bent, so C2v symmetry. That would make option D the answer.

So putting it all together:

A is a metal, perhaps iron.

B is O2.

C is Fe3O4 (magnetite), which is a dark reddish solid.

D is H2.

Reaction 1: Fe + O2 → Fe3O4.

Reaction 2: Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe + H2O (but wait, that's reduction, producing metal and water. But E is supposed to be extremely hazardous. H2O isn't hazardous. Hmm, maybe another reaction.)

Wait, maybe when C (Fe3O4) reacts with H2, it forms Fe and H2O. But E would be H2O, which isn't hazardous. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about D and B. Another possibility: B is Cl2, D is something else.

Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is something else. Let's say D is CH4. But CH4 isn't a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, their reaction would be 1:1, producing HCl (a gas, not a solvent). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: If B is O2, D is CO. They react in 1:1 to form CO2, which is a gas. But CO2 isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O. Then, 1:1 ratio would produce something else. But D is a gas, so H2O is a liquid, not a gas.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is something else. But NH3 is a gas, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Let's try to make an educated guess based on the information.

The correct answer is likely D) C2v, as E is H2S, which has that symmetry. So I'll go with option D.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a sequence of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color of C suggests it could be a transition metal oxide. A plausible candidate is Fe3O4 (magnetite), which is reddish-black but often described as red in certain contexts.  
   - If A is iron (Fe) and B is oxygen (O2), the reaction could be:  
     \[
     4 \, \text{Fe} + 3 \, \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3
     \]  
     However, the exact stoichiometry is not fully clear, but Fe3O4 fits the description of a red solid.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product.  
   - Gas D reacts with B (likely O2) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. A plausible candidate for D is H2, as H2 and O2 can form H2O, a common solvent.  
   - If C is Fe3O4 and D is H2, the reaction could involve reduction:  
     \[
     \text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4 + 4 \, \text{H}_2 \rightarrow 3 \, \text{Fe} + 4 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
     \]  
     However, this does not align with E being extremely hazardous. Instead, if C is a sulfide like FeS, and D is H2, the reaction could produce H2S, a toxic gas:  
     \[
     \text{FeS} + \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{Fe} + \text{H}_2\text{S}
     \]  
     H2S is a plausible candidate for E, as it is a highly toxic gas.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak).  
   - If C is FeS, the reaction with water could produce H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (a base, which does not fit the description).  
   - If C is a sulfide like CuS, the reaction with water might produce H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. However, the exact nature of C remains unclear.

4. **Symmetry of E**:  
   - If E is H2S, its molecular structure is bent, with a central sulfur atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms. This gives it a point group of C2v.  
   - Other options for E, such as O2 or H2, have D∞h symmetry, but these are reactants, not products. CO2 has D∞h symmetry but does not fit the reaction conditions.  

Based on the analysis, the most plausible candidate for E is H2S, which has a molecular symmetry group of C2v.  

**Answer: D**
