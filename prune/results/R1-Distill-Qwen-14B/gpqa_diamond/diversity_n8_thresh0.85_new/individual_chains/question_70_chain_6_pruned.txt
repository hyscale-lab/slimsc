Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me read through the problem again to understand the reactions and the compounds involved.

So, the first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. That's a lot of B compared to A. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what E is to determine its molecular symmetry. Let's think about possible compounds that fit these reactions.

Looking at the first reaction, solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. A solid reacting with a gas in such a high ratio. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen? For example, maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine gas (Cl2). The reaction between sodium and chlorine could form NaCl, but wait, the product is bright red. NaCl is usually white. Hmm, maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: if A is sulfur (S8), and B is something else. But sulfur is a solid, so when it reacts with something, maybe it forms something red. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal. Or perhaps B is oxygen? Let's think again.

Wait, let's consider the second reaction where C reacts with D. C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio (since 2 equivalents of D are used). The product E is extremely hazardous. What's a compound that forms from such a reaction?

Also, when C reacts with water, it gives back A and two acids, F and G. F is strong, G weak. So, C must be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases A and produces two acids. Common reaction like a metal oxide reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide (but that wouldn't give two acids). Or perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's think: if C is a sulfide, say FeS, reacting with water might not form two acids. Alternatively, maybe a nitride? Or perhaps something like a sulfate ester?

Wait, another angle: the reaction where D and B form H, which is a solvent. H is a solvent, so possible candidates could be H2O (but B would be O2?), but maybe H is something like HCl, but that's not a solvent. Or maybe H is H2O, but then D and B would have to be H2 and O2, but their ratio is 1:1, so 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a possibility.

Wait, the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). So if B is Cl2, and A is K (potassium metal), 8 equivalents would be 8 Cl2 molecules reacting with K. But K + Cl2 typically forms KCl, but that's not red.

Wait, bright red product C. What red compounds do I know? Maybe something like mercury(I) oxide, but that's red. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal compound. Or perhaps it's a sulfide? Wait, maybe copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Lead dioxide is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is Na and B is O2. But 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with Na would form NaO2 or something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is S. Iron reacts with sulfur to form FeS, which is black, though. Not red.

Wait, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another oxidation state? Chromium(VI) compounds are usually orange or yellow. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is PbO2 and B is something else. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where C is burned with D. C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a toxic gas. D could be Cl2, and E could be something like SO2 or HCl. But wait, if C is a metal sulfide, reacting with Cl2 might produce HCl and metal chloride? Not sure.

Wait, going back to the hydrolysis of C. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G weak. So, maybe C is a nitride? For example, if C is NH3 (but that's a gas, not solid). Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate? Or maybe a sulfite or sulfate.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a compound like a sulfite ester. Or maybe it's a metal carbonate, but that usually produces just one acid upon hydrolysis.

Wait, if C is a metal oxide. Suppose A is Na and C is NaO2. Then, when NaO2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH (a strong acid? No, NaOH is a base) and O2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a metal peroxide. For example, Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH and O2 gas. But that's just one product, not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, what if C is a sulfate ester, like something that upon hydrolysis gives a strong and weak acid. For example, if C is an acid anhydride. Like, say, SO3 reacting with water gives H2SO4, which is a strong acid, but wait, that's just one acid.

Wait another thought: maybe C is a mixed carbonate and something else. Or perhaps a nitrate and something else.

Wait, let's think about D and B reacting in 1:1 ratio to form H. H is a solvent. So, D and B could be H2 and O2, but that forms H2O, which is a solvent. So, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2
