Okay, so I've got this question about whether certain organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with chirality, right? Chiral molecules are those that are not superimposable on their mirror images, so they have a plane of symmetry or something like that. Wait, no, actually, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. Because a plane of symmetry would mean the molecule is identical on both sides, making it achiral.

Wait, wait. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has chirality. Chirality requires that the molecule has a carbon atom with four different substituents. Oh right, that's the tetrahedral carbon condition. So if a compound has such a carbon, it can have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

The question gives four options, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Hmm, that's a mouthful. So, it's a biphenyl structure, two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate ester groups (since it's dimethyl, the ester is OMe).

So the structure would have two rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. Now, can this molecule be chiral?

Biphenyl compounds can exhibit something called geometric isomerism if the substituents are on opposite sides, but optical isomerism is about chirality. For a molecule to have a chiral center, it must have a carbon with four different groups attached.

Wait, in this case, the biphenyl's central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is a single bond, so it's like a carbon (the central point) connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents? Or wait, no. Wait, each of the two rings is connected in a 1,1' fashion, meaning each ring is attached at their 1 positions. So the central point isn't a carbon; it's the point where two rings are connected. So no, the biphenyl itself doesn't have a carbon there. Maybe the substituents are in such a way that they create a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine the structure. The central bond is between the 1 positions of each benzene ring. On each ring, the 2 position has a COOCH3 group, and the 6 position has a NO2 group.

Wait, but the question is whether any of the substituents are on a chiral carbon. So let me look at the substituents. Each COOCH3 is attached to the benzene ring. The carbon in COOCH3 is the ester. The carbon in COOCH3 is O-C-O, but the central carbonyl is double bonded, so the adjacent carbon (the one attached to the benzene) is connected to O, two CH3 groups, and the ring. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-O-CH3. So the carbonyl is on the benzene ring, then the ester oxygen is attached to the benzene. The structure is like Ar-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait, the substituent is 2,2'-dicarboxylate dimethyl. So, each benzene ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2.

So, each COOCH3 is attached to the benzene. The structure is O=C-O-CH3. So the oxygen is part of the ester group. The carbon attached to the oxygen is the one attached to the benzene ring. So for each COOCH3 group, the carbon attached to the oxygen (the alpha carbon) would be connected to:

- The benzene ring (so a phenyl group)
- Two oxygen atoms (from the ester group, O-C-O)
Wait, no, the structure is O=C-O-CH3. So the carbonyl is attached to the benzene, then the oxygen is attached to the carbonyl and to the methyl group. So the alpha carbon (the one attached to the oxygen) is the one connected to the benzene, the carbonyl group, and the OCH3.

Wait, so the substituents on the alpha carbon would be:

- Benzene ring
- Carbonyl group (COOCH3)
- Two oxygen atoms? No, wait. Let me think again. The structure is Ar-O-CO-OCH3, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, no. The substituent is a carboxylate ester. So the structure at position 2 is: O=C-OCH3. So the carbonyl is attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is connected to the methyl group. The alpha carbon is the one attached to the oxygen, which is the carbonyl carbon. So that's a double bond, so no, that's spÂ² hybridized, not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: for a substituent like COOCH3, the structure is benzoyl-OCH3. So the carbonyl is part of an ester group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to the oxygen which connects to the methyl. So that carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to OCH3 and the benzene. So, the carbonyl is a trigonal planar structure. So no chiral center there.

But perhaps the molecule has some other chiral centers. Wait, the biphenyl structure could have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, axial chirality is a concept I remember from allenes or certain ring systems. For example, in biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers.

But I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the nitro groups are in such positions that create a chiral center.

Wait, the molecule is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has a COOCH3 at 2, and a NO2 at 6. Now, looking at the structure, since the biphenyl is connected at 1,1', the substituents at 2 and 6 might be on adjacent carbons. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but if the substituents are all symmetrically placed, maybe the molecule is not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to chirality. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a way that the molecule is meso. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but exhibits geometric isomerism. Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is due to chirality, not geometric isomerism.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's put this aside for a moment and look at the other options.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
The structure of this is CH3-C(OH)H-COO
