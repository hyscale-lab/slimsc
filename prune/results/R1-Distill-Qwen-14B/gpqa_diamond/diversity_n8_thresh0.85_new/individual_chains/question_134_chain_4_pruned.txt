Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, how exactly do I approach this?

Let me read the question again. It says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction. The options are in both kcal and kJ, so I guess I have to be careful with the units.

First, I think I should figure out how much H+ and OH- ions are present in each solution. Because when they mix, they'll neutralize each other. But wait, I should consider the stoichiometry here. HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely, so each mole gives one H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, each mole will give two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each mole will give two OH- ions.

So, let's break it down step by step.

Calculate moles for each solution:

For HCl:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.2 M
Moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl. So, 0.1 mol H+.

For H2SO4:
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Molarity = 0.3 M
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol.
Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L
Molarity = 0.5 M
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol.
Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So I need to find out which one is in excess.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.
Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, OH- is the limiting reactant here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves some H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So the total H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So when they mix, they'll neutralize each other. The reaction will use up all the OH-, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain (because 0.28 -0.2 = 0.08). So the total H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles.

But wait, what happens to the excess H+? Since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the second dissociation, it's not as strong as the first. But in this case, since we're mixing with a strong base, I think we can consider that the first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second may not be. Hmm, but in this case, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it's completely dissociated. So for H2SO4, both H+ ions are released.

Wait, no, actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second (HSO4- → SO4^2- + H+) is weaker. But when in solution, especially in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is considered a diprotic acid, but the second H+ may not completely dissociate. Wait, but I think for the purpose of stoichiometric calculations in neutralization, especially when there's a strong base present, we can assume that H2SO4 fully donates both protons. Or is that only when it's in a concentrated solution?

Wait, maybe I should think about it more carefully. The first H+ is definitely released completely, but the second might not be. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, it's assumed that both H+ from H2SO4 are available for neutralization. Let me check.

Wait, the problem is about neutralization when the solutions are mixed. So when H2SO4 is mixed with Ba(OH)2, the OH- will react with both H+ from HCl and H2SO4.

But let me proceed step by step.

So total H+ from HCl is 0.1, from H2SO4 is 0.18, so total 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2.

So, the neutralization reaction will proceed until either H+ or OH- is consumed. Since OH- is less than H+, OH- will be completely consumed, and 0.08 H+ remains.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of water, I think.

Wait, but wait, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So for each mole of H+ and OH- that react, one mole of water is formed.

So, 0.2 moles of water are formed.

But wait, is that all? Let me think about the actual acid-base reaction.

Wait, the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH
