Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me read through it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. The NMR data is given, so I should probably look at that first to figure out the structure. Then, I need to see what happens when it reacts with those three reagents.

The reagents are:
1. NaNO2 and HCl
2. H2O
3. Aqueous KOH and heat.

Wait, the order of reactions. NaNO2 and HCl is usually a nitrous acid condition, which is used for diazotization. That typically happens with aromatic amines, especially aniline derivatives. So maybe the compound has an amino group or something that can be converted into a diazonium salt.

The NMR data is in ppm. Let me write down the signals:

9.72 ppm: a triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton or an acidic proton like a phenol, but aldehyde is more around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes in certain conditions, like if it's conjugated, it could be lower? Or maybe an aldehyde. But wait, in the options, I see a lot of aldehydes, like but-enal structures. So that peak might be the aldehyde proton. But wait, the triplet... Hmm, aldehyde protons are usually singlets or maybe split into something else. Let me think. If it's an aldehyde, but coupled with two protons, like maybe in a CH2 group next to it? No, wait, an aldehyde is RCHO, the proton is on the carbonyl. If there's coupling, maybe the aldehyde proton is coupling with adjacent protons. But wait, the aldehyde is at the end, so maybe if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2, then the H could be split into a triplet? Not entirely sure.

Next signal: 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons, maybe on a para-substituted ring. Because a doublet suggests that each of those protons has one neighboring proton. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has two neighboring Hs, right? Wait, no, that's in a meta position. Wait, no, wait, for a para substitution, each aromatic proton has two adjacent Hs in the ortho positions. So maybe a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps it's a doublet because of coupling to something else, like a substituent.

Then 6.51 ppm, another doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. Maybe in a para-substituted ring. So perhaps two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets, which suggests each is in a para position relative to a substituent.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause that. Wait, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring with two protons that are equivalent. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol structure.

Then 3.66 ppm, a doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something else.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, perhaps two aromatic rings, considering the options have diphenyl groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation: each double bond or ring counts as one. So C8H9NO – formula is C8H9NO. For the degree of unsaturation:

Each degree is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5? That can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Oh wait, wait, I think I messed up the formula. The correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, X=0 (since no halogens), N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees.

That could be from, say, a benzene ring (3 degrees), a carbonyl (1), and an amine group perhaps (but amines are saturated). Or maybe a ring and double bonds.

Wait, maybe the structure has a benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and another double bond (1) – total 5. Or perhaps two benzene rings but that would be 6 degrees (each benzene is 3). Wait, C8H9NO: if two benzene rings, that's 6 degrees, but we have 5, so maybe one ring and some double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring and another ring or a carbonyl. Let's think.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton. Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two different sets of aromatic protons, maybe on two different rings. Or perhaps one ring with substituents.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. Maybe a CH2 connected to oxygen. So perhaps an OCH2 group.

Wait, let me think of the possible skeleton. Let's say the molecule has a benzene ring with a substituent, maybe a CH2-O- group attached to another ring. Or maybe a substituent that includes an aldehyde.

Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm, which is a triplet. So the H is coupled with two others. So maybe RCHO where R is CH2-. So like CH2CHO. Then, the CH2 would be next to the aldehyde. So the CH2 group would have two Hs, each seeing two Hs on adjacent. But wait, the CH2 is next to the aldehyde, so the aldehyde H would be a triplet because of coupling with the two Hs on the CH2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the aldehyde proton (CHO) is adjacent to a CH2 group. So the coupling would be with the two Hs on the CH2. Thus, the triplet at
