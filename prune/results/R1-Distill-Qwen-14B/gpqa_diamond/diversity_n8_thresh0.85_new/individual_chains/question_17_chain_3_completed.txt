Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a given Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. 

The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the complex is 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. A high K value like this means the complex is very stable.

Wait, so the complex is Ca-EDTA. I think the formula for the complex is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. The formation constant, K, is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh right, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about that. That makes things easier because it implies that EDTA is in its correct form to bind Ca²+.

So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. The question is asking for [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions.

Since the formation constant is K = 5e10, which is really large, the complex is almost completely formed. But wait, if K is so large, that would mean that [CaY²-] is much larger than the product of [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-], right? So maybe [Ca²+] will be very small.

But wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of all species related to Ca and EDTA should be considered. Let me think. The total concentration would be [Ca²+] + [CaY²-] ≈ [CaY²-] because K is so huge. Similarly for EDTA: [EDTA^4-] + [CaY²-] ≈ [CaY²-], since most EDTA is tied up in the complex.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, when it dissociates, it can release Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me write the equilibrium expression. The reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-      K = 5e10

So K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M minus the amount that dissociates. But wait, if K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So, [CaEDTA²-] ≈ 0.02 M. That makes sense because the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

So, substituting into the equation:

K ≈ 0.02 / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, what's the relationship between [EDTA] and [Ca²+] in this scenario? Because the EDTA is coming from the dissociation of the complex. Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium. So, [Ca²+] = x. Similarly, [EDTA^4-] = x because each dissociation releases one EDTA^4- ion. So, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So substituting into K:

5e10 ≈ 0.02 / (x * x) → 5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x²

Wait, solving for x²:

x² ≈ 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 → wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, or 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Or wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 which is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Wait, let me double-check. The K expression is correct, right? K is 5e10, and [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02. So 5e10 equals 0.02/(x^2). Solving for x² gives x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14? Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x^2 =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. Wait, 6.3e-7 is approximately 2e-6.5 because 10^(-6.5) is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is ~6.3e-7. So yes, that's correct. 

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) with a formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}, \quad K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and assuming the pH is ideal (EDTA is in its active form), the dissociation is minimal due to the very large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \). Thus, \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \([Ca^{2+}] = x\). Since each dissociation releases one \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and one \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \implies 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
