Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction. Hmm, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? I think that's a base, maybe used in some kind of elimination or ring-opening reaction. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used in the formation of epoxides from certain substrates. Oh wait, actually, wait—no, I think it's used for epoxide openings or maybe as a base in elimination reactions. Or wait, maybe it's used in the formation of epoxides? Alternatively, is it used in the Birch reduction or some other reaction?

Wait, the compound X has the formula C11H12O. Let me think about the options given. The options are all epoxides: A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, D) 2-styrylepoxide.

Oh wait, the product's NMR is given, so I need to figure out what's happening. Let's think about the reaction. If X is an epoxide, and it's reacting with a base, perhaps it's undergoing an acid-catalyzed ring opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation. Wait, no. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, so maybe it's used in the epoxidation of an alkene. Oh wait, epoxidation typically uses peracids, like mCPBA. But 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane isn't a peracid. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide under basic conditions. Or perhaps it's a different reaction, like a conjugate addition.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given, so the reaction is converting X into something else. Or perhaps X is an epoxide, and the base is causing some kind of ring-opening. But the product's NMR doesn't have the epoxide signals. Wait, looking at the product's 1H NMR data: there are signals at 6.75-7.71, which are aromatic. The 1H NMR shows a triplet of doublets or something? Let me see: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, the downfield shifts suggest aromatic protons. Let me count the protons: 1+2+1+2=6 aromatic H's. That might be a para-substituted benzene with some substituents. Wait, but also, two singlets at δ 2.28 and 2.31, each 3H—so two methyl groups. So, what compounds have two methyl groups and an aromatic ring?

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Styryl is a vinyl benzene. So the structure would be an epoxide (oxirane) attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene) which has a methyl in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent on the epoxide is a propenyl group attached to a phenyl. The structure would be like a vinyl group attached to a benzene, but in a different position—so maybe more branching.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The epoxide has a methyl at
