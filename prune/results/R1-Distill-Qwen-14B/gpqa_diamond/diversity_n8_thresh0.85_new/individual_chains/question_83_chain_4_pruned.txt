Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations aren't my strongest suit. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to figure out what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we add water, we're diluting it, which should make it less acidic. Then, when we titrate with NaOH, a strong base, we'll be neutralizing the acid.

Wait, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution can be found using the dilution formula: C1V1 = C2V2.

C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when I titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid. Let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial volume was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So initial moles before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the moles stay the same because dilution doesn't change the number of moles. So yes, 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

So for the equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. The volume of NaOH at equivalence point would be (moles)/(Molarity) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

25% of 0.
