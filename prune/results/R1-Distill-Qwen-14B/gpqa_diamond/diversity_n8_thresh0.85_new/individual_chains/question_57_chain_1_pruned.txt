Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude involves some phase shifts. The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄, and tells me to ignore the rest. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, what's the formula again for the scattering amplitude? Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) depends on the phase shifts. The general form is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ) ) / (something), but maybe that's for each partial wave.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the optical theorem or something related to the imaginary part. Oh right, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. The formula I recall is Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total, where k is the wave number.

But wait, how do I get σ_total from the phase shifts? Oh, right! The total cross-section for elastic scattering can be found using the sum over all the phase shifts. The formula is σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ ( (2l + 1) sin² δ_l ), where the sum is from l=0 to l_max.

So let me see, given the phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and the rest are ignored. So l goes up to 4.

First, I need to compute each term (2l +1) sin² δ_l, sum them, multiply by 4π/k², and that gives σ_total.

Wait, but what's k? The wave number. Remember that the electrons have energy 50 MeV. We can find k from the relativistic energy.

The energy of an electron is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ). For non-relativistic speeds, E≈K.E. + m c², but 50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass (about 0.511 MeV), so it's highly relativistic. So the approximation p ≈ sqrt(2mE) might not hold. Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

Wait, but in electron scattering, the wave number k is given by p/(ħ), because k = p/ħ. Alternatively, since E = ħ ω, and p = ħ k. So perhaps we can relate the energy to the momentum.

Wait, the energy E is given as 50 MeV. But electrons have rest mass m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than m_e c², so E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E / c. But wait, E in eV, c in m/s. Let me think about the units.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate k. Let's start by finding the momentum p.

E = 50 MeV = 50 × 1e6 eV. The rest mass is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV.

In the relativistic limit, when E >> m_e c², E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/(c). But I need to make sure of the units.

Wait, let's calculate p in units of kg m/s. But maybe it's easier to use natural units where ħ=c=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express k in terms of MeV and use appropriate constants.

Wait, the relation between energy and momentum for relativistic particles is E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)^2. So p = sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c. 

But since E is 50 MeV and m_e c² is ~0.511 MeV, E is much larger, so p ≈ E / c. Let me compute p.

But let me get the units right. Let's compute p in kg m/s. Energy E is 50 MeV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

But wait, E = pc => p = E/(c). So c is 3e8 m/s. So p = 8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s). J is kg m²/s², so kg m/s.

So p = (8.01e-13) / (3e8) = approximately 2.67e-21 kg m/s.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because E = 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Hmm, in scattering experiments, when they say energy E, they usually mean the kinetic energy. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, in particle physics, when they say an electron has energy E, it's usually the total energy, including rest mass. So E = 50 MeV is the total energy.

So then, p = sqrt( E² - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c.

But since m_e c² is much smaller than E, p ≈ E/c.

Wait, let's compute p more accurately.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.18e-14 J.

So E² is (8.01e-13
