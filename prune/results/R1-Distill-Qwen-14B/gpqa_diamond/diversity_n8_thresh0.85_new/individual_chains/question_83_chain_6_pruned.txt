Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let me read the question again. So, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. They also give the Ka of acetic acid as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution because that will be the starting point for the titration.

So, the initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. When we add the same volume of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. So, dilution. Molarity is moles over volume, so the moles of acetic acid before dilution are 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters). Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L (40 cm³), so the new concentration is moles over volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that makes sense because when you double the volume, the concentration halves. So now the acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, we're going to neutralize the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So, each mole of acetic acid will react with a mole of NaOH.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to find out how much moles of NaOH have been added, which is 25% of the moles of acetic acid present.

Wait, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid first. The diluted solution is 0.025 M, and the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, that matches what I thought earlier. So the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, amount of NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. So, initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001, moles of NaOH added: 0.00025. So, the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So after reaction, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, when you titrate, the total volume of the solution increases because you're adding NaOH solution. But for the 25% mark, I think we can calculate the volume of NaOH added and then find the new total volume.

Wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, moles of NaOH = 0.00025 = 0.1 * V → V = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So the total solution volume at 25% titration is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- in the solution are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. So yes, that's correct.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a mixture of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, let's calculate pKa. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let me compute that. log(1.85e-5) is about log(1.85) + log(1e-5). log(1.85) is around 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) ≈ -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, [A^-] is the concentration of acetate (from NaOH), which is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Rounding to two decimal places, that's about 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 at 25%, and 8.52 at equivalence. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So first part matching option A and D. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculation steps.

Wait, let me re-calculate the concentrations:

moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.00075 mol.

moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Perfect, same as before.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pKa + log(0.005882/0.017647) = 4.733 + log(0.3333) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈4.256, so 4.26. So first part is 4.26, which matches option A and option D is higher. Wait, options: A says 4.26 and 8.52; D says 4.57 and 6.92.

So the first part is 4.26, so perhaps the answer is A or D.

Wait, but wait—another thought: perhaps I should consider the dilution more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, when you add 25% of the required NaOH, it's 25% of the moles of acetic acid. So the moles of NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025. Correct.

So the buffer is correct. So the pH at 25% is 4.26, so option A's first part matches.

Now, what's the pH at equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So total solution volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L.

At equivalence, all the CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^- (acetate ions). So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So the acetate ion is a weak base, and it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb → Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that x is the concentration of OH^- produced, and x is small (since Kb is small), we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈9.02.

Wait, but that's around 9.02, but none of the options have a pH of 9 at equivalence. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the solution at equivalence point is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should be basic, but the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

Wait, Kb is correct: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10 = (x^2) / 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5, as before. So pOH is about 4.98, pH is 14 -4.98=9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → that's lower than my calculation.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → also lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I calculated the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt. The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, but at equivalence point, all the acid is converted to conjugate base. So [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is 0, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base:

The hydrolysis reaction is as I did before. Alternatively, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

OH- concentration = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which is what I did.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Wait, another way: Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. What is log(1.85e-5)? Let me compute it:

log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5)= 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa =4.7328.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So that's correct. Now, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb =5.405e-10 = (x^2)/0.02 → x^2=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, none of these have pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the dilution correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.001, so the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³ =0.05 L. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M.

Hmm, that's correct. So why is the pH not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps I'm using wrong formula.
