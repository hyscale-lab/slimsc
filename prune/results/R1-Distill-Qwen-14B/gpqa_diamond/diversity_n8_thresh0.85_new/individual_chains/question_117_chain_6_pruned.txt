Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are also called enantiomers. So, the compounds must have chiral centers or some other form of asymmetry to exhibit this.

The question gives four options, each a different organic moiety, and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations A to D. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So the structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The groups attached are nitro at 6 and 6' positions on each ring and a dicarboxylate (two ester groups) at 2 and 2'. Wait, but the possibility here is for the biphenyl to have some kind of stereoisomerism. Biphenyls can have different conformations due to rotation around the central bond, but can they have a fixed configuration that would lead to optical isomerism? Oh, wait, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetric, maybe it can have enantiomers. The nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are para positions on each benzene ring. The ester groups are on the 2 positions. So looking at the structure, if each benzene ring has substituents that make the entire molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the biphenyl system has a plane of symmetry, maybe not. Let me think. Since the substituents are on 2 and 2', and 6 and 6', around each ring. If the molecule has a mirror plane, maybe it's achiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think that if the substituents are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, it can have isomers. For example, if the substituents are such that the two rings are different, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself doesn't have enough symmetry, leading to the possibility of enantiomers. So I'm leaning towards yes for option 1.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw this structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the structure is (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's a three-carbon chain. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) has an OH group, a CH3 group, and a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, wait, no: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? No, because propanoate has three carbons. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that can't be right because the middle carbon would have two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the methyl ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) has four different groups: a methyl (CH3), an OH, a COOCH3 group, and a hydrogen (since it's CH(CH3)(OH)(COOCH3)H?) Wait, no, wait. Let me try again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? So the carbon chain is CH2-CH(OH)-CH2COOCH3? No, I think I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3-O-C-O- something. No, wait. The correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) has the OH, two CH2 groups (one connected to the first carbon, which is CH3, and the other to the third, which is COOCH3). Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one attached to OH) has groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and one more. Wait, let me count: the structure is:

CH3
|
C(OH)
|
CH2COOCH3?

No, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon of propanoate) is connected to:

- One CH3 group
