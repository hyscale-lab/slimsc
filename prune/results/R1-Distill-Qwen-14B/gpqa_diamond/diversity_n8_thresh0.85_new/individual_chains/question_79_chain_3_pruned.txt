Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction and the resulting NMR spectra. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this.

First, the reaction details. Compound X (C11H12O) is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used base, often called DABCO. It's used in various reactions, like as a base in epoxide ring-opening reactions, or maybe in elimination reactions. Oh, wait, DABCO is often used in the Hofmann elimination as a catalyst, but in this case, maybe it's acting as a base to deprotonate something or facilitate a reaction.

The product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H and 13C NMR. The 1H NMR shows several signals: a singlet at 2.28 ppm (3H), another singlet at 2.31 (3H), a doublet at 6.75 (1H), another doublet at 7.08 (2H), a doublet at 7.68 (1H), and a doublet at 7.71 (2H). The 13C NMR has signals at 21.3 and 28.4 (each singlets, probably CH3 groups), some carbon signals around 126-130 (probably aromatic carbons), and some higher up like 141.5, 144.1, and 197.7 (that's a carbonyl or maybe an epoxide oxygen-bearing carbon? Or maybe an ester? Wait, 197 is pretty high; carbonyls are around there. Or an epoxide would have carbons around 60-70 maybe? Hmm, not sure. Wait, epoxide carbons are typically around 55-65 ppm, but maybe that's the carbonyl in an ester or ketone.

Wait, the starting material is compound X (C11H12O). The product is formed after reaction with DABCO. So what kind of reaction could that be? DABCO is a base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something. Maybe an epoxide opening? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide via a base?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination. Let me think about epoxides. Epoxides can undergo ring-opening reactions under basic conditions. For example, if the starting material is an epoxide, and DABCO, a strong base, is used, perhaps it's opening the epoxide.

Wait, another thought: DABCO is sometimes used as a catalyst in the formation of epoxides from alkenes via the Prilezhaev oxidation, but that's with peracids, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide to form a diol? But then the product would have diol groups, which would show up in the NMR as OH protons, perhaps. But in the 1H NMR, I don't see any broad signals that would indicate OH groups. So maybe it's not that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination, forming an epoxide. Wait, but then the starting material would have a diol or something else. Hmm, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and DABCO is causing some rearrangement or opening.

Wait, looking at the product's NMR. Let's analyze the 1H first. There are two singlets for 3H each. Those are probably two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signalsâ€”like if they're attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons. Maybe they're on a quaternary carbon or attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like an oxygen. But wait, in epoxides, the adjacent carbons can have protons that might split each other.

Wait,
