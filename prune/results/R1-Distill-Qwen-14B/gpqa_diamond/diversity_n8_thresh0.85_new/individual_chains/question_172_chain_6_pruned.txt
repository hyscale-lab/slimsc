Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember something about the photosphere and LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Oh right, LTE means that in the photosphere, the gas behaves almost like a perfect blackbody emitter, and the conditions are such that we can use the Boltzmann distribution for energy levels.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution formula is probably key here. The distribution of particles in different energy states is given by the Boltzmann factor. The number of particles in a higher energy state compared to a lower one is proportional to the Boltzmann factor of the energy difference divided by kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant.

So if the energy difference is delta E, the ratio of populations should be (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-delta E/(k T)). But wait, in this case, star_1 has twice as many atoms excited in a specific level as star_2. So the ratio for star_1 would be n1_upper/n1_lower, and for star_2 it's n2_upper/n2_lower.

Wait, no. Wait the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for the same energy level, the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio is (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * [ (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) ].

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the setup wrong. Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So for that specific energy level, say E, the number of atoms in E in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or is it the excitation relative to the ground state?

Wait, but the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given. So let's think: The excitation is from a lower energy level to a higher one, say E and E + delta E. The ratio of the excited state to the lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for each star, the ratio would be (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -
