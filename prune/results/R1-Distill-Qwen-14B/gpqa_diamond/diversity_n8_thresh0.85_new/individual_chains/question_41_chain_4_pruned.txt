Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. 

Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through glass with refractive index n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So, the glass is moving towards the lab frame—wait, no, the observer is in the lab, right? So the glass is moving towards the observer because it's moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the lab. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me visualize this.

The light beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So if the beam is moving towards the observer, then the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

Wait, but the question is about the speed of the light relative to the lab. So when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of light in it? Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but this might involve both the refractive index and the motion of the medium.

Wait a second, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. The refractive index affects the speed of light in the medium. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? So without any movement, the speed would be 1/n, since c=1 here.

But here, the glass is moving. So how does the movement of the medium affect the speed of light in it, as observed in the lab? I think it's a case where you have to consider the medium's motion and the light's motion through it.

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when the medium is moving, the speed of the light as observed in the lab would be different. The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + u*v), where u is the speed of the light in the medium's frame, and v is the speed of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. In the frame of the glass (the medium), light is moving at speed 1/n. Because normally, speed in medium is c/n. So u is 1/n.

But wait, no—wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light_medium = c/n = 1/n.

So the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the lab
