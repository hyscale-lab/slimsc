Okay, so I have this physics problem about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Wait, phase shifts in scattering... Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * Pl(cosθ), where the sum is over all the orbital angular momentum states l. But wait, the question specifies to ignore the rest of the phase shifts except those given. So they only provide δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4. I guess I need to consider all these up to l=4.

The problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh, wait, along the incident direction means θ = 0 degrees. Because that's the direction the particle is coming from. So when θ is 0, cosθ is 1. That might simplify things because Pl(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because the Legendre polynomials Pl(1) = 1 for any l. So each term in the sum will have Pl(1) = 1.

So the formula for f(θ=0) would be (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum from l=0 to 4 of (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) multiplied by (2l+1) and then multiplied by Pl(1), which is 1. So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) ] for l=0 to 4.

Now, I need to compute this sum. Let me list the given phase shifts: δ0 is 90°, δ1 is 67°, δ2 is 55°, δ3 is 30°, δ4 is 13°. All in degrees, so I might need to convert them to radians for calculations, or perhaps I can handle the exponentials in degrees? Well, in any case, the formula uses 2iδ_l, so I'll have to calculate e^{2iδ_l} for each l.

Wait, but in the formula, δ_l is in radians or degrees? Because when dealing with complex exponentials, angles are typically in radians. So I should convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians. Let me think about that.

So for each l from 0 to 4, I need to compute e^{2iδ_l}. Let me write down each term:

For l=0: δ0 = 90° = π/2 radians.
e^{2iδ0} = e^{iπ} = -1. So (e^{2iδ0} - 1) = (-1 - 1) = -2. Multiply by (2l+1)=1, so term is -2 *1 = -2.

Wait wait, no. Wait l=0, 2l+1 is 1. So term is (e^{2iδ0} -1) * 1 = [e^{iπ} -1] = (-1 - 1) = -2. So that term is -2.

For l=1: δ1=67°. Let's convert to radians. 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.169 radians. 2δ1 ≈ 2.338 radians. e^{2iδ1} = e^{i2.338}. Hmm, let's think about that. The complex exponential e^{iθ} has a real part cosθ and imaginary part sinθ.

So e^{i2.338} ≈ cos(2.338) + i sin(2.338). Let me compute those values.

cos(2.338): 2.338 radians is about 134 degrees. Cos(134) is cos(180-46) = -cos(46) ≈ -0.6947.

Sin(2.338) is sin(134) = sin(46) ≈ 0.7193.

So e^{i2.338} ≈ (-0.6947) + i (0.7193). So (e^{2iδ1} -1) is [ (-0.6947-1) ) + i (0.7193) ] = (-1.6947) + i 0.7193.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3 (since l=1, 2*1+1=3) → 3*(-1.6947 + i 0.7193) = -5.084 + i 2.1579.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = e^{iθ} - 1, which can be written as e^{iθ/2} * 2i sin(θ/2). Because e^{iθ} -1 = e^{iθ/2} (e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2}) ) = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2). So perhaps using that identity would be easier.

But perhaps for simplicity, I can just compute each term numerically.

Similarly, for each l, compute (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) and multiply by (2l+1), then sum all terms.

But this seems a bit tedious. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me compute each term for l=0 to 4.

l=0: δ0=90°, so 2δ0=180°, which is π radians.

e^{iπ} = -1.

(e^{2iδ0} -1) = (-1 -1)= -2.

Multiply by (2*0 +1)=1. So term is -2.

l=1: δ1=67°, 2δ1=134°.

In radians, 134° is (134 * π)/180 ≈ 2.34 radians.

e^{i2.34} = cos(2.34) + i sin(2.34).

Calculating cos(2.34): 2.34 radians is about 134 degrees. cos(134)= cos(180-46)= -cos(46)= -approx 0.6947.

sin(134)= sin(46)= approx 0.7193.

So e^{i2.34}= (-0.6947) + i (0.7193).

So (e^{2iδ1} -1) = [ (-0.6947 -1) ] + i (0.7193) → (-1.6947) + i 0.7193.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3 → 3*(-1.6947 + i 0.7193) = -5.0841 + i 2.1579.

l=2: δ2=55°, 2δ2=110°.

Convert 110° to radians: 110 * π/180 ≈ 1.9199 radians.

e^{i1.9199} = cos(110°) + i sin(110°).

cos(110) = cos(90+20) = -sin(20) ≈ -0.3420.

sin(110)=sin(90+20)=cos(20) ≈ 0.9397.

So e^{i1.9199} ≈ (-0.3420) + i 0.9397.

(e^{2iδ2} - 1)= (-0.3420 -1) + i 0.9397 → (-1.3420) + i 0.9397.

Multiply by (2l+1)=5 → 5*(-1.3420 + i 0.9397) = -6.71 + i 4.6985.

l=3: δ3=30°, 2δ3=60°.

60° is π/3 radians ≈1.0472 radians.

e^{i1.0472} = cos(60°) + i sin(60°) = 0.5 + i (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.5 + i 0.8660.

(e^{2iδ3} -1) = (0.5 -1) + i 0.8660 → (-0.5) + i 0.8660.

Multiply by (2l+1)=7 → 7*(-0.5 + i 0.8660 )= -3.5 + i 6.062.

l=4: δ4=13°, 2δ4=26°.

Convert 26° to radians: 26 * π/180 ≈0.4537 radians.

e^{i0.4537} = cos(26°) + i sin(26°).

cos(26)= approx 0.8988.

sin(26)= approx 0.4384.

So e^{i0.4537} ≈ 0.8988 + i 0.4384.

(e^{2iδ4} -1) = (0.8988 -1) + i 0.4384 → (-0.1012) + i 0.4384.

Multiply by (2l+1)=9 → 9*(-0.1012 + i 0.4384) = -0.9108 + i 3.9456.

Now, summing all these terms for l=0 to 4:

Let me list each term:

l=0: (-2) + i 0 → Real: -2, Imaginary: 0.

l=1: Real: -5.0841, Imag: 2.1579.

l=2: Real: -6.71, Imag:4.6985.

l=3: Real: -3.5, Imag:6.062.

l=4: Real: -0.9108, Imag:3.9456.

Summing the real parts:

-2 + (-5.0841) = -7.0841.

-7.0841 + (-6.71) = -13.7941.

-13.7941 + (-3.5) = -17.2941.

-17.2941 + (-0.9108) = -18.2049.

Summing the imaginary parts:

0 + 2.1579 = 2.1579.

2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564.

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184.

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So the total sum is (-18.2049) + i (16.864).

But wait, the formula has (1/(2ik)) multiplied by this sum. So f(0)= [1/(2ik)] * (sum).

Wait, but wait, what is k? Because in scattering theory, k is the wave number, which is sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, in the given problem, the electrons are 50 MeV. So I need to compute k.

Wait, the problem states that the electrons have 50 MeV. So the incident electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if this is their kinetic energy or their total energy. Typically, in scattering experiments, especially high-energy, the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, so the electrons are ultra-relativistic. But for precise calculation, perhaps I should consider their rest mass.

Electron mass is about 0.511 MeV/c². So 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511, so the electrons are highly relativistic. So the energy E is approximately 50 MeV.

The wave number k is given by k = (E)^(1/2) * [ (E)^(1/2) + m ] / (ħ c) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should recall the relativistic expression for the wave number. Or perhaps use the non-relativistic formula, but 50 MeV is high energy, so that might not be accurate.

Wait, the formula for k in terms of the energy: For a free particle, the relation between energy E and momentum p is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

Then, the wave number k is p/(ħ). Because p = ħ k.

So, E is given as 50 MeV. m is 0.511 MeV/c².

So, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

Let me compute this:

E =50 MeV, m c² =0.511 MeV.

E² = 2500 (MeV)^2.

m c² squared is (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 (MeV)^2.

So (pc)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 → pc ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.99739 MeV.

Thus, p ≈ 49.99739 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c) → Wait, let me think. Because p = ħ k, so k = p/(ħ).

Wait, but p is in units of MeV/c. So to compute k, which is in inverse length, perhaps I should ensure the units are consistent.

Wait, ħ has units of MeV s. c is in MeV/(fm) because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, and c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So let me think about units.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute k in units of inverse femtometers (fm^-1) because the options are given in fm.

Wait, but let me proceed step by step.

Given that p ≈ 49.9974 MeV/c, and ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. Because ħ is about 6.582 MeV s, and c is about 3e8 m/s. 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So ħ c = 6.582e-25 MeV m → 6.582e-25 * 1e15 fm → 6.582e-10 MeV fm. Wait that can't be right. Let me see:

Wait, actually, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. Because 197.33 MeV fm is a standard value. So yes, ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c) → Wait, no. Because p is in MeV/c, and ħ c is in MeV fm. So p (MeV/c) = p (MeV/(fm * (ħ c))) ) * (ħ c) → since p = ħ k, k = p/(ħ c).

Wait, perhaps p is in MeV/c, so ħ c is in MeV fm. Therefore, p (MeV/c) = (ħ c) * k → k = p/(ħ c) → [MeV/c ] / [MeV fm] ) → 1/(fm).

So k = p/(ħ c) = (49.9974 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 49.9974 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2535 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.2535 fm^-1.

Wait, but let me compute it accurately. 49.9974 divided by 197.33.

Let me compute 49.9974 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2535.

So 1/(2ik) is 1/(2i * 0.2535 fm^-1) ) → 1/(0.507 i fm^-1) ) → approximately (1.972 i)
