Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. They measured the positions, and none were found below x=1 or above x=3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3 when measured. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function squared (the probability density) must integrate to 1 over all space because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 100%. Also, the wave function must be normalized.

Wait, but how does this apply here? The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So that's a complex function. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So for ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, the absolute square would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Because when you have a complex number like A + Bi, the absolute square is A² + B². So here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5, so when squared, it's (0.5)^2.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the wavefunction is zero outside that interval, right? Because when they measured, particles were found only between 1 and 3. So the wavefunction probably doesn't exist outside that region, or the probability is zero there.

Wait, no, the wavefunction is given in part of the space where it can exist. So the wavefunction is zero elsewhere, but the given part is between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, no, the problem says the wave function is as given in the part where it can exist. So it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the probability density is non-zero only in that region.

So to normalize the wavefunction, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx must be 1.

So the integral becomes ∫[ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute this integral. Let's break it into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

First integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from x=1 to x=3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), so evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, let me compute that. Ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So a² is approximately 0.7202. Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistake in the integral?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Yes, because (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is a²/(1+x) and (0.5i)^2 is -0.25, but when taking the modulus squared, it's |A + Bi|^2 = A² + B². So 0.5^2 is 0.25. That part is correct.

So the integral is correct. Then a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a²=0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7202 → a≈0.8485. Closest to 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the
