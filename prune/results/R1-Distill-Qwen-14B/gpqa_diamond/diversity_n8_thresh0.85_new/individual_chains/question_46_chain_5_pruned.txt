Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. It says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal complex, usually Ruthenium-based, that facilitates this process. So, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure to visualize.

3-methylpent-1-ene has a five-carbon chain. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch on C3. So, it's CH₂=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, no. Let me count the carbons again.

Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would add a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me write it correctly.

Pent means five carbons. Position 1 is the first carbon. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂- ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me number the carbons. Carbon 1: CH₂-, carbon 2: CH-, then carbon 3: CH(CH3), then carbon 4 and 5? Wait, no. Let me write the structure again.

The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait, not quite. Let me think. Pent is five carbons, so positions 1 to 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2 (pent-1-ene). The methyl group is on carbon 3. So:

Carbon 1: CH₂–
Carbon 2: CH– (because of the double bond)
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)–
Carbon 4: CH₂–
Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, but that would be CH₂=CH-
