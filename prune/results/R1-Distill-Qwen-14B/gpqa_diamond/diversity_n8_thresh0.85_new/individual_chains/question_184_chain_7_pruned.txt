Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. So I'll need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the options given.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents:

1. A tert-butyl group at position 2.
2. An ethoxy group at position 1.
3. A nitro group at position 3.

Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me think. Benzene is a six-membered ring. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the structure would have the tert-butyl (t-Bu) at position 2, ethoxy (-OEt) at position 1, and nitro (-NO2) at position 3. Hmm, that's a meta arrangement relative to each other.

Now, the synthesis steps usually involve electrophilic substitution reactions. I remember that directing groups play a big role here. Each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to specific positions.

So, let's plan the order of adding substituents. The order might affect the positions where the groups attach.

The substituents are:

- tert-butyl (t-Bu): a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group.
- Ethoxy (OEt): strong activating, ortho/para-directing as well.
- Nitro (NO2): strong deactivating, meta-directing.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. So if I add nitro after other groups, it would affect where they go. Alternatively, adding activating groups first might make it easier because they can be introduced under less harsh conditions.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, so perhaps it's better to add it first because adding it later might lead to problems with directing.

Wait, perhaps I should add the nitro group first. Let's think.

If I start with benzene and first nitrate it, I'd get nitrobenzene, which is meta directing. Then, adding another substituent would go to the meta position relative to the nitro group. But wait, the target has nitro in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and t-Bu in 2. Let me number the benzene ring with nitro at position 3, then ethoxy at 1, and t-Bu at 2. So, looking at the ring, positions 1 is adjacent to 2, which is next to 3. So the three substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let's try that.

First step: Nitration. Benzene + HNO3, H2SO4 (nitrating mixture) would give nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director.

Second substituent: Let's say we add ethoxy next. Wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so it would direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para. But if we add ethoxy after nitro, which is a meta director, where would the ethoxy go?

Wait, no. The ethoxy group is being added as a substituent. So when adding the ethoxy group, the existing nitro group would determine where it goes. Since nitro is meta directing, the ethoxy would go to the meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, but when you add a substituent, the existing substituents direct where the new group goes. So, for example, adding ethoxy to nitrobenzene.

Nitro is meta directing. So when we add ethoxy as the next substituent, it would go into a position that's meta to the nitro group. Let's see: nitro is in position 3. Then, ethoxy would be in position 1 or 5, depending on how you number.

Wait, perhaps numbering would be such that the nitro is at position 1, then ethoxy and t-Bu are adjacent. But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to draw this mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the activating groups first. Because once a deactivating group is present, the subsequent reactions are more difficult.

So if I add the ethoxy group first, then nitro, then t-Bu. But wait, ethoxy is a strong activating group, so it would direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para. So adding nitro next would go to para or ortho relative to ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so after ethoxy, where would the nitro group go?

No, wait. The nitro group is a substituent that would be added via a nitration reaction, which is an electrophilic substitution. The existing substituent (ethoxy) would direct the incoming nitro group.

Since ethoxy is ortho/para directing, the nitro would go ortho or para to the ethoxy. Let's say the ethoxy is in position 1. Then the nitro could go to position 3 (meta relative to ethoxy's position 1?), but wait, ethoxy is in 1, so para would be 4, ortho would be 2 and 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If ethoxy is at position 1, then the nitro group, being an electrophile, would be directed to ortho (2) or para (4) positions. But nitro is a meta director, but wait, no: the nitro group would be the incoming substituent, not the existing one.

Wait, no, in this scenario, the existing substituent is ethoxy. The incoming substituent is nitro. So, ethoxy is activating, ortho/para-directing. So the nitro would be added at ortho (2) or para (4) relative to ethoxy.

If we add nitro to position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1), that's meta relative to ethoxy?

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the target structure.

Target: positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

So, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3. So, in a row.

So, adding substituents in the order nitro, ethoxy, tert-butyl might not work because each new group would have to fit into the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the t-Bu group first, then the ethoxy, then the nitro.

Wait, t-Bu is a strong activating group (alkyl), so it directs ortho/para. If I add t-Bu first, then the next substituent could be ethoxy, which would go ortho or para to t-Bu. Then the nitro would be added in a position directed by both groups.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about each step.

Let me imagine the steps:

Starting with benzene.

Step 1: Introduce t-Bu (tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 as catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation). So benzene becomes t-Bu benzene. Now, the ring has a strong activating group, so it's activated and directs ortho/para.

Step 2: Introduce ethoxy group. Since the ring is activated, and the t-Bu is ortho/para directing, the ethoxy could be introduced via an etherification. Wait, how would that happen? Oh, perhaps via an electrophilic substitution. Wait, introducing an ethoxy group would require a nucleophilic substitution or perhaps something else. Oh, wait, more accurately, to introduce an ethoxy group, you can use a Williamson ether synthesis, but that's typically for forming ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Alternatively, perhaps using an electrophilic substitution with an ethyl group followed by hydrolysis might not work.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the methods. Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups, but O-ethylation would require a different approach. Because benzene can't react directly with ethanol under Friedel-Crafts conditions; those are for alkylation, not acylation or O-alkylation.

Ah, right, O-ethylation usually requires a different approach. For example, using an ethyl halide
