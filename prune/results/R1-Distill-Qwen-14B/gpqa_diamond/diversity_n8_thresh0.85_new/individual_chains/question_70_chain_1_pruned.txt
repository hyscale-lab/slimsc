Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm. Let me read through the problem again and try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about a reaction between solid A and gas B. They use 8 equivalents of B, and the product is bright red C. Then, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. 

Next, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, which makes me think of something like HCl, and G is a weak acid, maybe like H2SO3 or something. Wait, no, more likely H2SO4? Or maybe H3PO4? Not sure yet.

Then, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. That gives me a clue about what H could be. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, methanol, maybe something else. But wait, D and B react 1:1. Since B is a gas, maybe it's something like CO2 or another gas.

Let me try to map out the possible compounds here. 

First, the reaction A + 8B → C. Bright red product C. Hmm, bright red makes me think of certain compounds, like maybe a transition metal complex. But wait, another thought: if A is an element, maybe. For example, if A is sulfur (S8), and B is something else... Not sure yet.

Wait, when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids. So, maybe C is a salt that breaks down into A and two acids. For example, if C is something like FeSO4·7H2O, but upon heating, it loses water and forms FeO and maybe other products. Or perhaps C is a metal sulfite or sulfate.

Wait, let's think about when C reacts with water. If the products are A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G a weak acid... So, perhaps C is a metal carbonate or something that produces two different anions upon hydrolysis. For strong acid and weak acid, maybe the carbonate would form a strong acid (like H2SO4?) and another? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal bisulfate. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think about the products when C reacts with water: A, F, and G. So, C is a compound that when it reacts with water, it breaks down into A, which is a solid, and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal chloride, but that might not split into two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. Let me think: if C is a metal sulfate, for example, like CuSO4·5H2O, which is blue, but that's not red. Wait, but maybe if it's a different metal. Oh, maybe it's a transition metal with a red color. For example, iron(III) oxide is reddish, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a different kind of compound.

Wait, another thought: when C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Extremely hazardous could mean something like a nerve gas, a highly toxic substance, or something like phosgene. But E is the product of C and D. Alternatively, maybe E is something like chlorine gas or another poison.

Wait, let's think about D reacting with B to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B are gases, 1:1 ratio. For example, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, then H would be HCl, which is a strong acid, but not exactly a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is something else. Or maybe B is CO2 and D is something else.

Wait, wait, another approach. Let's consider that when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. So perhaps C is a salt that when dissolved in water, it breaks down into A (maybe a metal oxide), and produces two different acids. For example, suppose C is a metal sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't change much, but maybe in the presence of acid, it decomposes. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bisulfate, which when decomposed could form two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate or some other salt.

Wait, another thought: the initial reaction is A (solid) + 8 B → C. If A is a metal, like Fe, and B is O2, then maybe 8 O2 would combine with Fe to form FeO2? No, that's not a common formula. Wait, Fe would typically form FeO, Fe3O4, etc. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, maybe A is a metal, and B is Cl2. Let's see: 8 equivalents of Cl2. So for example, if A is Fe, then Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Fe. But Fe is in a +3 oxidation state in FeCl3, which would require 3 Cl2 per Fe. So 8 doesn't fit. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe A is a metal and B is H2. For example, if A is Fe and B is H2, perhaps under certain conditions they form something. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the reactions and their possible products.

When C reacts with D, it forms E. And D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. So D and B are gases that form a solvent when they react. Solvents could be like HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent), water, maybe something like ethanol or methanol? Wait, but D and B are gases reacting to form H, so H must be a liquid solvent. So what two gases react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Let me think.

CO2 and H2O can't form a solvent (they form H2CO3, which is a weak acid, not a solvent). What about SO2 and H2O? No, that would form H2SO3, which is a weak acid, not a solvent. Wait, maybe H is something like H2O. But how? Because D and B are both gases.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then they could react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O, which is a solvent. But O2 and H2 would need a catalyst to react, but that's possible. So B is O2, D is H2. Then H is H2O. That makes sense.

Wait, but let's check the other parts. So B is O2. Then, the first reaction is A + 8 O2 → C. So the product C is formed by A reacting with O2 in a 8:1 ratio. What could A be? Maybe a metal with a high oxidation state.

Wait, but when C reacts with water, it forms A (the solid), F (a strong acid), and G (a weak acid). So, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, suppose C is FeO. Then FeO + H2O → Fe(OH)2, which isn't giving me two acids. Hmm, maybe C is a sulfate. If C is Fe2(SO4)3, for example. Then Fe2(SO4)3 + H2O might not decompose into two acids. Or perhaps it's a more complex salt.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitride. For example, AlN is a solid, but when it reacts with water, it forms Al(OH)3 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For instance, if A is carbon, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, C is a metal carbonate. Suppose C is Na2CO3. Then, reacting with water would just dissolve, but perhaps upon heating, it might decompose into NaOH and CO2. But that's not two acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the product E. E is formed when C reacts with D. And D is a gas. From earlier, I thought D is H2. So C + H2 → E.

Wait, if C is Fe3O4 (which is a mixture of FeO·Fe2O3), but when C reacts with H2, it might reduce. Wait, but Fe3O4 + H2 could produce Fe and water. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if A is S (solid sulfur), and B is some gas that when reacted in 8 equivalents would form a sulfide. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If D is H2 and C is Fe3O4, then Fe3O4 + H2 (in presence of a catalyst) could form Fe and H2O. But that's not producing E as a hazardous product. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, and D is H2. Then, nitride + H2 → NH3? But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, and D is CO. Then, C + CO could form a carbothermic reaction, but that might not fit.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let's think about the reaction when C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C is likely a salt that breaks down into two different anions—the cations would form the solid A, and the anions would form the two acids.

So perhaps C is a salt like (NH4)2SO4, which when dissolved in water would give NH4+ and SO4^2-, but that would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and NH3 (weak base), which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfite, like MgSO3. Then MgSO3 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 (a solid) + H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, what if C is a metal hydrogen sulfate, like Fe(HSO4)2? Then, when it reacts with water, it would release H+ ions. But I'm not sure if that would split into two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a metal carbonate and a metal sulfite together. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitro compound. For example, nitro groups could hydrolyze into nitric acid and something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate. If C is NaH2PO4, then reacting with water might not change much, but perhaps in excess water, it might form H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH. Hmm, but that would produce a strong base, not an acid. So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible acids F and G. F is a strong acid, so maybe H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc. G is a weak acid, so maybe H3PO4, H2CO3, H2SO3, etc.

So if F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO3, but wait, HNO3 is a strong acid too. So that can't be. So perhaps F is HCl, a strong acid, and G is H2S, a weak acid, but H2S is a gas, not formed as an acid in the reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal sulfate. Let's say C is CuSO4·5H2O. When it reacts with water, it just dissolves into Cu^2+ and SO4^2- ions. But then, where do the acids come from? Unless upon decomposition, but that doesn't immediately fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hypochlorite, like Ca(ClO)2. Then, when it reacts with water, it might produce HClO (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2, but then F would be HClO, which is weak, and G... Wait, no, perhaps I've got that mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfite. If C is Na2SO3, then upon reaction with water, it just stays as Na+ and SO3^2- ions. But without reacting further, that wouldn't produce acids. Unless in acidic conditions, but that's not the case here.

Wait a minute, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Let's say C is Al(NO3)3. Then, when Al(NO3)3 reacts with water, it would dissociate into Al^3+ and NO3^- ions. But that wouldn't produce acids, just the ions.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the reactions again.

First Reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red product).

Second Reaction: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).

Reaction of C with water gives A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

And D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio).

So, if D and B reacting in 1:1 ratio to form H (solvent), possible options are:

- B is Cl2, D is H2 → H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that can't be.

- B is O2, D is H2 → H is H2O (a solvent). That fits. So, B is O2, D is H2. Then, H is H2O.

So, B is O2, D is H2.

So, in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 O2 to form C.

So, A + 8 O2 → C.

What could A be? Maybe a metal that when oxidized with 8 equivalents of O2 forms a compound.

Wait, let's think about metals and their oxidation states. For example, if A is Fe (atomic weight ~56), then 8 moles of O2 would be 8×32=256 g. But maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal in a low oxidation state, and upon reaction with O2, it gets oxidized. For instance, Fe metal (0 oxidation state) reacting with O2 to form FeO2? Not sure about that. Alternatively, Fe can form FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, etc.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of a metal with O2 in a high amount. If A is Fe, then 8 O2 would imply a lot of oxygen. Maybe Fe reacting with excess O2 to form FeO2 (but I don't think FeO2 is a common compound). Alternatively, perhaps the product is FeO(OH) or something else.

Alternatively, maybe A is carbon (solid). Then, carbon reacting with O2 could form CO2. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles O2 per mole of C. The reaction would be C + O2 → CO2. But that's a 1:1 ratio. So 8 O2 would be way more. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: A is a metal and B is O2, and C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Pb (lead), and the reaction is Pb + 8 O2 → PbO4? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal oxide.

Wait, the product C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Perhaps certain metal oxides. For example, CoO is blue, MnO2 is dark brown. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, like Fe2O3·nH2O is reddish. So, maybe C is Fe2O3.

So, if C is Fe2O3, then the first reaction would be A (Fe) + 8 O2 → Fe2O3. Let's check the stoichiometry.

The balanced reaction for Fe burning in O2 to form Fe2O3 is:

4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3.

So, the mole ratio is 4 Fe : 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3.

But in the problem, 8 equivalents of O2 are used. So, 8 moles of O2 per mole of Fe.

Wait, in the problem, it's A (solid) + 8 B (O2) → C.

If A is Fe, then 8 O2 would mean:

Fe + 8 O2 → Fe2O3?

But the balanced equation requires 3 O2 for every 4 Fe. So, perhaps the ratio is not matching. Alternatively, perhaps A is a different metal.

Wait, maybe A is Al. The reaction of Al with O2 is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. So, 4 Al : 3 O2. So, for one mole of Al, it's 3/4 O2. But the problem says 8 O2 per A, which is a lot. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a higher oxide. For instance, maybe it's a metal that forms a +4 oxidation state, like Sn or Pb.

Wait, if A is Pb, then the reaction could be Pb + 8 O2 → 2 PbO2. Let's see:

Pb + 8 O2 → 2 PbO2.

Balancing this: Pb is 1 on each side. O on the right is 2×2=4 O, so 4 O atoms. On the left, 8 O atoms. So to balance O, we need a coefficient for PbO2. Wait, perhaps 2 Pb + 8 O2 → 4 PbO2. Then, the equation becomes 2 Pb + 8 O2 → 4 PbO2.

Wait, that would mean each Pb is consuming 4 O2. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of O2 per A, which is one mole of A. So, if A is Pb, 1 Pb would need 4 O2, but the problem uses 8 O2. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again about the reaction when C reacts with water to form A, F, and G.

If C is Fe2O3, then Fe2O3 + H2O → Fe(OH)3. But Fe(OH)3 is a solid, and that doesn't produce two acids. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is FeS, but that's black, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. If C is Fe(NO3)3, then when it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Fe^3+ and NO3^- ions. That doesn't produce two acids either.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a phosphate. For example, if C is Ca3(PO4)2, which is a white solid, but when it reacts with water, it doesn't change. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate, like CaCO3. Then, CaCO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + CO2↑. But CO2 is a gas, not an acid. So F and G would be Ca(OH)2 (a base) and CO2 (
