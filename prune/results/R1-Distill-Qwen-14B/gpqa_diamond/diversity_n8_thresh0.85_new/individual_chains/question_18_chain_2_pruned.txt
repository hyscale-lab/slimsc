Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, compared to each other. The problem gives me some elemental abundance data and asks for the ratio [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], or something like that? I think the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1's photosphere to Star_2's.

Alright, let me parse the given data. Both stars have masses, but I'm not sure if that matters for this particular calculation. The key seems to be the elemental abundances.

So, for Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the logarithm of the ratio of silicon to iron abundance is 0.3. Wait, no, wait. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm base 10 of (X/Y ratio relative to the Sun). So [X/Y] = log10((X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun).

And [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) ratio. So 0 means (Fe/H) is the same as the Sun's, right? So Star_1 has the same iron abundance as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg is more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So Mg/H is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but for Star_2, [Fe/H] isn't given. Hmm... I think it's not needed because we can figure out [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, let's think about what each of these means. The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = 3.16e-5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH) = -5. So nMg/nH = 1
