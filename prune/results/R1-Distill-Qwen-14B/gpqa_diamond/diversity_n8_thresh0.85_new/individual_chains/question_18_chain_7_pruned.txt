Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

First, I need to understand what the given data is. Both stars have masses greater than the Sun, but I'm not sure if their masses matter here. The problem mentions using the EW method and LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium and Equivalent Width method. But maybe the key here is the abundance ratios given.

Let me list out the data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, wait. I think that notation is a bit tricky. Because the way it's written is 12 plus log equals a number. So, for Fe, it's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/H is 10^(-4.5) per H. Similarly for Mg, it's log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH is 1e-5.

I think the [X/Y] notation is log(nX/nY). So, [Fe/H] would be log(nFe/nH) which is -4.5 for the Sun. But for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning nFe/nH is the same as the Sun? Because [Fe/H] is 0, so log(nFe/nH) =0 → nFe/nH =1. Wait the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 -12 = -4.5? No, wait no. Because the [Fe/H
