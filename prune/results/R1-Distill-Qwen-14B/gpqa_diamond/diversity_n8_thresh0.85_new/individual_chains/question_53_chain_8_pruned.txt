Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it slow and see if I can figure it out.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound's FTIR and 1H NMR spectra have given some clues. Let's break down the information.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So the aromatic ring has two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a characteristic absorption around 1740 cm^-1, typically a strong peak. That makes sense, so the molecule has an ester functional group.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows six signals. Let's see what each of those signals correspond to.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H: Since it's di-substituted, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Maybe para-substituted? Or perhaps ortho and para. Wait, no, if it's para, the two substituents would be opposite each other, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. Or if it's meta, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, the substituents might be such that there are two types of aromatic protons. For example, if the ring is substituted with two different groups, perhaps leading to two sets of protons each. But wait, if it's di-substituted and the substituents are in para positions, then the ring would have symmetry, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. Like, if the substituents are para to each other, the H's opposite each substituent would be equivalent. Hmm, but wait, in para substitution, the aromatic H's are all equivalent if the substituents are the same. But since the substituents are different (because the molecule has an ester, but maybe another group?), perhaps the H's are in two different environments. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's hold that thought for a moment.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: So there are two groups with vinyl protons. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to a double bond. So maybe an alkene group is present. The fact that one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets suggests coupling between these protons. For example, in a trans configuration, or perhaps in some sort of coupling with adjacent groups.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two sets of methyl groups. That could mean that the molecule has two methyl groups in different environments. For instance, perhaps one is adjacent to an oxygen (like an ester's R-O-CO-O-R?), and the other is somewhere else.

And importantly, there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups (-CH2-). So all the CH2 groups are either absent or maybe not present in the structure. So the molecule might be made up of CH3, CH, and aromatic CH groups.

Now, let me think about possible structures that fit this.

Since the compound has an ester group, it's likely something like an aryl ester, or maybe an ester with an aromatic ring and some other substituents. Let's think about common structures. Maybe something like methyl benzoate, but that's a mono-substituted ring. Wait, but our compound is di-substituted. So perhaps it's a di-substituted benzoate ester. Or maybe a substituted phenyl group connected via an ester.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals. The aromatic protons: in a benzene ring with two substituents, the number of signals depends on the substitution pattern. If the substituents are in para positions, that would create two equivalent protons opposite each substituent, leading to one set. But wait, if the substituents are different, then each substituent would cause the adjacent H's to be different. So for example, if the substituents are at the para position but are different groups, the ring's H's would be split into two sets. For instance, if substituent A is in position 1 and substituent B in position 3 (I might be getting the positions wrong), but perhaps
