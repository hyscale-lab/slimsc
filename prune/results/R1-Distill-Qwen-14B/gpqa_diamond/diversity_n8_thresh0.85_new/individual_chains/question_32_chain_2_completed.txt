Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think I remember that Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, the question is about relativistic energy. So I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. But wait, the question is about the energy of the RHIC, which would be the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, in particle accelerators, when they talk about the energy of the collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify that.

But wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So maybe it's the total energy. Because in relativity, when you have speeds a significant fraction of c, you have to consider gamma factors.

So, first, I need to find the relativistic gamma factor for v = 0.96c. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, let me compute more precisely. Because 0.28 is an approximation. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784) accurately. Wait, 0.0784 is 0.0784. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784):

Well, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

But wait, wait. Let me confirm: 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857. Yes.

So the gamma factor is about 3.5714.

Now, the total energy of the nucleus is gamma times the rest mass energy. But wait, what is the rest mass energy of Li-6?

The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of Li-6 can be looked up, but I don't remember the exact value. Alternatively, the rest mass can be calculated using the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but for a nucleus, the mass is a bit less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. However, in this context, when calculating relativistic energy, do I use the rest mass of the entire nucleus or sum of individual particles? Hmm.

Wait, the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its parts. So I need the actual rest mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, I can approximate using the mass number. The mass of a nucleus is roughly A * (mass of a nucleon), but corrected for binding energy. But since the problem doesn't give specific masses, perhaps I can proceed with the assumption that the rest mass is the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as Li-6, which can be found from the periodic table. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Let me confirm that. I think the exact value might be important here because the energy depends on it.

Wait, I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 u. So I can use that.

So, the rest mass energy (m0c²) is 6.0151 u multiplied by the conversion factor to GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me calculate that:

6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 * 931.5 = 5589.0 MeV
0.0151 * 931.5 ≈ 14.007 MeV
So total ≈ 5589 + 14 ≈ 5603 MeV → 5.603 GeV.

Wait, let me do the math more accurately:

6.0151 * 931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.0151 *931.5 = 14.00165.

So total is 5589 +14.00165 = 5603.00165 MeV → 5.60300165 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, the total energy (E) of the nucleus is gamma * m0c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.603 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.603.

Let's compute 3 *5.603 = 16.809.

0.5714 *5.603 ≈ 5.714 *5.603? Wait, no, 0.5714 is 5714/10000.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 5.603 *3.5714.

Let me compute step by step:

5.603 *3 = 16.809
5.603 *0.5 = 2.8015
5.603 *0.07 = 0.39221
5.603 *0.0014 = 0.0078442

So adding all together:

16.809 +2.8015 =19.6105

19.6105 +0.39221 =20.00271

20.00271 +0.0078442 ≈20.01055 GeV.

So approximately 20.0106 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me use more precise calculation.

Wait, 3.57142857 is 25/7 exactly.

So 25/7 *5.603 GeV.

Compute 25 *5.603 =140.075

Then divide by 7: 140.075 /7 = ?

7*20 =140, so 140.075 /7 =20.010714 GeV.

So E ≈20.0107 GeV.

But the options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, 20.0107 isn't exactly any of the options. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the rest mass energy was 5.603 GeV, and gamma is 3.57142857, so 5.603 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.603 * 3.57142857 more accurately.

3.57142857 is 25/7, as I thought.

5.603 *25 = 5.603 *20 +5.603*5 =112.06 +28.015 =140.075.

140.075 divided by7 is 20.01071428 GeV.

So E is approximately 20.0107 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. My calculation gives about 20.01 GeV.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass energy calculation. Let me check that again.

The mass of Li-6 isotope: I think the exact mass is about 6.0151 atomic mass units.

But wait, I might be using the wrong value. Let me think.

Wait, another way: the atomic number is 3 (Li), and it has 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6.

The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for a mixture of isotopes. But for Li-6, the exact mass is about 6.0151 u.

So 6.0151 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u equals:

6.0151 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute that.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0151 *931.5 = (0.01 *931.5) + (0.0051 *931.5)

0.01 *931.5 =9.315

0.0051 *931.5 = approx 4.74065.

So total is 9.315 +4.74065 =14.05565 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.05565 =5603.05565 MeV =5.60305565 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but then why is my total energy 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is 20.132 GeV (option C). Is there a mistake in my gamma calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

Compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximations.

Wait, let's compute 1 - v²/c² again.

v=0.96c → v²=0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

But wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps I should re-calculate gamma with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for more precise value.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, that's correct.

So, yes, 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy (K) instead of the total energy (E). Because sometimes in these contexts, the energy given is the kinetic energy.

So, if E is the total energy, K = E - m0c².

So, from earlier, E is approximately 20.0107 GeV.

Subtracting the rest energy (5.603 GeV) gives K ≈14.4077 GeV.

But looking at the options, none of them is around 14 GeV. The options are 18, 23, 20, 21.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but that doesn't align with the options.

Wait, the question states, "the energy of the RHIC". I think that RHIC's energy per beam is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes as the total energy.

Wait, a quick recollection: in accelerators, the energy is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes when people refer to the beam energy, they mean the total energy, especially when discussing high energies where the rest mass is negligible. But in this case, since the speed is 0.96c, the gamma is about 3.57, so the total energy is much larger than the rest mass, but the kinetic energy is about (gamma-1) m0c².

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total energy per nucleus.

So, in that case, I have E = gamma * m0c² ≈20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is higher. Let me double-check the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6.

Looking it up (but I can't actually look it up, but I'll think), Li-6 has a mass of about 6.0151 atomic mass units. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is talking about the energy per nucleon? No, the question says the speed of the nucleus X, so it's the nucleus as a whole.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me think about the actual calculation.

Wait, 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.0151 *931.5 =?

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589

0.0151 *931.5 = approx 14.055 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.055 =5603.055 MeV →5.603055 GeV.

So that's correct.

Then, E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.603055 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 *5.603055.

Let me compute 3 *5.603055 =16.809165.

0.57142857 *5.603055 ≈ ?

0.5 *5.603055 =2.8015275

0.07142857 *5.603055 ≈ approx 0.07142857 *5 =0.35714285, and 0.07142857 *0.603055≈0.04307.

So total for 0.07142857 is 0.35714285 +0.04307≈0.40021.

So 0.57142857 *5.603055 ≈2.8015275 +0.40021=3.201738.

So adding to the 3*5.603055 part: 16.809165 +3.201738=20.0109 GeV.

So E≈20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this exactly. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Maybe the rest mass of Li-6 is higher than 6.0151 u?

Wait, let me think. Another way: perhaps I should use the exact formula for gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 ) 

Wait, another approach: compute gamma more accurately.

Compute (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... as before.

Hmm, perhaps the discrepancy is because the problem expects the kinetic energy. Let's compute that.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma-1) * m0c².

Gamma is 3.5714286, so gamma-1=2.5714286.

So K= 2.5714286 *5.603055 GeV.

Compute that:

2 *5.603055 =11.20611.

0.5714286 *5.603055 ≈3.201738.

So K=11.20611 +3.201738 ≈14.407848 GeV.

But none of the options are close to 14.4 GeV. So that's not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe the energy is per nucleon, but the question says the speed of the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total energy, but I'm not getting any of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6 u. Let's think again.

Lithium-6: number of protons=3, neutrons=3. So mass number A=6.

The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So the total mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons is 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

But the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.0151 u, which is less because of binding energy. So the difference is 6.047823 -6.0151 =0.032723 u, which is the binding energy equivalent.

So the rest mass of the nucleus is 6.0151 u.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron), but no, the nucleus is a whole.

Hmm, alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total energy of each nucleon? That doesn't make sense because the speed is of the entire nucleus.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should compute gamma using beta =v/c=0.96, and then compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1-beta^2).

Yes, that's what I did.

Wait, maybe a miscalculation in the product: 3.5714 *5.603.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.603.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.603 = ?

0.6 *3.5714=2.14284.

0.003 *3.5714=0.0107142.

So 2.14284 +0.0107142=2.1535542.

So total is 17.857 +2.1535542=20.01055 GeV.

Same result as before.

Hmm, but the options don't have that exact value. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact atomic mass is different. Let me see: I think Li-6 has a mass of about 6.0151 u, but perhaps it's 6.015123 u or something more precise.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass is 6.0151 u, and the calculation is correct, but the options might have a rounding error. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but 20.01 is about 0.12 GeV less than 20.132. That's a significant difference in the fourth decimal place. Wait, the question says the precision is at 1e-4, so four decimal places. So perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Wait, let me compute the rest mass more accurately.

Li-6: exact mass is 6.015123 u.

So m0c² =6.015123 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589.

0.015123 *931.5= ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005123 *931.5= Let's compute 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, 0.000123 *931.5=0.1141095.

So total 4.6575 +0.1141095=4.7716095.

Adding to 9.315: 9.315 +4.7716095=14.0866095 MeV.

So m0c²=5589 +14.0866095 =5603.0866095 MeV →5.6030866095 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.6030866095.

Let me compute this exactly.

3.57142857 *5.6030866095.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6030866095.

Let me compute this part.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0030866095 *3.57142857≈0.01103138 (because 3.57142857 *0.003=0.0107142857, and 3.57142857 *0.0000866095≈0.00031038).

So total 0.01103138.

Adding 2.142857142 +0.01103138 ≈2.15388852.

So E=17.85714285 +2.15388852=20.01103137 GeV.

So E≈20.0110 GeV.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm. So the calculated E is approximately 20.011 GeV, which is not exactly any of the options. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me check using a more precise atomic mass.

Wait, another source says the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015123 u. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relativistic momentum or kinetic energy, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the mass of the proton for the nucleus, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the total energy in each beam, and the options are actually considering the kinetic energy plus rest mass, but that's what I calculated. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I should compute the total energy using the relativistic equation E² = (pc)² + (m0c²)², but since we know the velocity, I think the gamma approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, let me recompute gamma.

v =0.96c.

beta =0.96.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, now I'm confused. The calculation gives me approximately 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. The difference is about 0.12 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass was taken as 6.0 u instead of 6.0151 u.

Let me see what would happen if m0c² is 6.0 u *931.5 MeV/u =6 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then E=3.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.589 = ?

3.5714 *0.5=1.7857.

3.5714 *0.08=0.285712.

3.5714 *0.009=0.0321426.

So sum is 1.7857 +0.285712=2.071412 +0.0321426=2.1035546.

So total E=17.857 +2.1035546=19.96055 GeV.

Which is about 19.96 GeV. Closer to option C (20.132) but still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation requires more precise decimal places.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 6.01505 u instead of 6.0151 u. Let me compute that.

m0c² =6.01505 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01505 *931.5=?

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00505 *931.5= approx 4.702725.

So total 9.315 +4.702725=14.017725 MeV.

So m0c²=5589 +14.017725=5603.017725 MeV=5.603017725 GeV.

Now E=3.57142857 *5.603017725.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.603017725.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603017725=16.809053175.

0.57142857 *5.603017725.

Compute 0.5 *5.603017725=2.8015088625.

0.07142857 *5.603017725 ≈0.40020804.

Adding 2.8015088625 +0.40020804=3.2017169025.

Total E=16.809053175 +3.2017169025=20.01077 GeV.

Which is about 20.01077 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, maybe the options are using a different approach, like using the relativistic kinetic energy equation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering each nucleon moving at 0.96c, but that's not the case because the nucleus as a whole is moving at that speed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rest mass in MeV, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, maybe I should compute using more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma can be computed more accurately.

Wait, 1 - (0.96)^2 =1-0.9216=0.0784.

The exact square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, actually, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, so there's no error there.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to around 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is 20.132 GeV. Let me see: what if the rest mass is 6.015123 u, and the calculation is precise to four decimal places?

Wait, let me compute E with more precision.

Gamma: 3.5714285714285714.

m0c²:5.6030866095 GeV.

Compute 3.5714285714285714 *5.6030866095.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

3.5714285714285714 *5.6030866095.

First, compute 3 *5.6030866095 =16.8092598285.

Then 0.5714285714285714 *5.6030866095.

Compute 0.5714285714285714 *5 =2.857142857142857.

0.5714285714285714 *0.6030866095.

Wait, 0.5714285714285714 *0.6030866095.

Compute that:

0.5 *0.6030866095 =0.30154330475.

0.0714285714285714 *0.6030866095≈0.04314435.

So sum is approximately 0.30154330475 +0.04314435=0.34468765475.

So 0.5714285714285714 *0.6030866095 ≈0.34468765475.

So 0.5714285714285714 *5.6030866095 =2.857142857142857 +0.34468765475≈3.20183051189.

Now, adding to the 3 *5.6030866095 part: 16.8092598285 +3.20183051189=20.01109034039 GeV.

So E≈20.01109 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c or u. For example, if u is taken as 931.494 MeV/u instead of 931.5, would that make a difference?

Let me recalculate m0c² with 931.494 MeV/u.

m0c²=6.015123 u *931.494 MeV/u.

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.015123 *931.494= ?

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.005123 *931.494= approx 4.77084.

So sum 9.31494 +4.77084=14.08578 MeV.

Total m0c²=5588.964 +14.08578=5603.04978 MeV=5.60304978 GeV.

Now E=3.57142857 *5.60304978.

3 *5.60304978=16.80914934.

0.57142857 *5.60304978.

Compute 0.5 *5.60304978=2.80152489.

0.07142857 *5.60304978≈0.400208.

So 2.80152489 +0.400208=3.20173289.

Adding to 16.80914934 gives 20.01088223 GeV.

Still the same as before. So no change.

I'm not sure why the calculated value doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, but the problem states 'energy of the RHIC', which is usually the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the rest mass to be considered as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without binding, which would be 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

Then, m0c²=6.047823 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5= approx 44.642 MeV.

So total m0c²=5589 +44.642=5633.642 MeV=5.633642 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.633642.

3 *5.633642=16.900926.

0.57142857 *5.633642≈3.2128 GeV.

So total E=16.900926 +3.2128=20.1137 GeV.

Which rounds to approximately 20.1137 GeV, which is closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Ah! So perhaps the problem is assuming that the rest mass is the sum of the individual nucleons, not considering the binding energy. That would make the rest mass higher, and hence the total energy higher.

In that case, the calculation gives around 20.11 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

But why would the problem make that assumption? Because the binding energy is usually significant, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's being ignored.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the atomic mass of Li which includes electrons. Oh, wait! Lithium has three electrons per atom, but in the nucleus, the electrons are separate. So when considering the nucleus, the electrons' mass isn't part of the nucleus's mass.

Wait, but the atomic mass includes electrons, so if I'm considering the nucleus alone, I need to subtract the mass of the electrons.

Wait, that's a good point. Oh no! I think I made a mistake here. Because the atomic mass includes electrons, but the nucleus's mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So for a neutral Li atom, which has three electrons, the mass of the atom is approximately 6.0151 u. So the nucleus's mass would be 6.0151 u minus the mass of three electrons.

Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons would be 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus's mass is 6.0151 u -0.00164574 u =6.01345426 u.

Ah, that changes things!

So m0c²=6.01345426 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01345426 *931.5= let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00345426 *931.5= approx 3.215 MeV.

So sum is 9.315 +3.215=12.53 MeV.

Total m0c²=5589 +12.53=5601.53 MeV=5.60153 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.60153 GeV.

Compute:

3 *5.60153=16.80459.

0.57142857 *5.60153 ≈ ?

0.5 *5.60153=2.800765.

0.07142857 *5.60153≈0.40142 GeV.

Sum:2.800765+0.40142=3.202185.

Total E=16.80459 +3.202185=20.006775 GeV.

So around 20.0068 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the kinetic energy.

Wait, K=(gamma-1)*m0c².

So with m0c²=5.60153 GeV and gamma=3.57142857.

K=(3.57142857-1)*5.60153=2.57142857 *5.60153.

Compute 2.57142857 *5 =12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.60153≈approx 1.5463.

So K≈12.85714285 +1.5463=14.4034 GeV.

No, that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rest mass of the nucleus without electrons, as I did earlier. So m0c²=5.60153 GeV. Then E=gamma * m0c²=3.57142857 *5.60153≈20.0068 GeV.

But none of the options are 20.0068 GeV. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why my calculation doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the electrons.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a collection of protons and neutrons, each moving at 0.96c, but that's not the case. The nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the relativistic energy equation without considering the rest mass accurately.

Hmm. Given that I'm not getting an exact match, and the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, I'm inclined to think that perhaps the intended answer is option C. Maybe the original calculation didn't account for the electrons, leading to a higher rest mass, hence higher total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the initial calculation without considering the electrons.

Earlier, with m0c²=5.603 GeV (including electrons), E=20.01 GeV.

Ah, but when I considered the nucleus's mass as 6.01345 u (subtracting electrons), E=20.0068 GeV.

Hmm. So either way, the answer isn't matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy per nucleus, but that doesn't align with the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma again using more precise methods.

Compute gamma =1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) with v=0.96c.

v=0.96c → beta=0.96.

beta^2=0.9216.

1 -beta^2=0.0784.

Now, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857 exactly.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed, like 0.98c, but the question states 0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate using the exact values for more precision.

Wait, let me compute E=gamma * m0c² with m0c²=5.603 GeV and gamma=3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.603 = ?

3 *5.603=16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603.

Compute 0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603 ≈0.4002.

So total 2.8015 +0.4002=3.2017.

Adding to 16.809 gives 20.0107 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0107 GeV.

Hmm, the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I don't see why my calculation isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus as 6.0 u, ignoring the binding energy and electrons. Then, m0c²=6.0 *931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.589=20.01 GeV.

But that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be expressed in a different unit or has a typo in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy.

Wait, 6.0151 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.0151 *931.5.

Compute 6*931.5=5589.

0.0151 *931.5=14.055 MeV.

Total:5589 +14.055=5603.055 MeV=5.603055 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.603055=20.0107 GeV.

Hmm. Now, perhaps the options are using a different value for c or other constants, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the total energy of each beam, considering both the kinetic and rest energy, but that's what I've calculated.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the center-of-mass energy, but that's a different calculation and usually involves combining two beams.

But the question says the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, implying a single beam.

So, after all this, I think the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, perhaps due to a different approach in the rest mass calculation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, and the correct answer isn't listed. But given the options, the closest is C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we calculate the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus, and \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \) as follows:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has a rest mass of approximately \( 6.0151 \, \text{u} \). Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.0151 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5603.055 \, \text{MeV} = 5.603055 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Substituting \( \gamma \) and \( m_0 c^2 \) into the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.603055 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
3.5714 \times 5.603055 = 3 \times 5.603055 + 0.5714 \times 5.603055
\]
\[
3 \times 5.603055 = 16.809165 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 5.603055 \approx 3.201738 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E = 16.809165 + 3.201738 \approx 20.0109 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.0109 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which likely accounts for slight differences in rest mass or rounding conventions.

### Final Answer
**Answer: C**
