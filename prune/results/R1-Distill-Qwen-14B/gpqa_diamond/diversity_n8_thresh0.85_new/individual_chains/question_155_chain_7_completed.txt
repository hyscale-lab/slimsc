Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, when the system is in a state |ψ> is given by the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but wait a minute. The state given is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the expectation values might not be straightforward. Also, since P_x and P_z might not commute, I can't assume that the expectation values are diagonal or anything.

Let me look at what's given. The matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that in this basis, the P_z matrix is diagonal. That makes sense because the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z, so the matrix representation should diagonalize it.

The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, let me write that down. Each component is a probability amplitude. So this is the state vector ψ in the P_z eigenbasis.

So to compute <P_z>, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. But wait, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component in ψ is the amplitude for a particular P_z eigenstate. So maybe this is easier than I thought.

Let me recall, in the eigenbasis of P_z, the operator P_z is diagonal. So when you have a state |ψ> in that basis, each component represents the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate of P_z.

So the expectation value <P_z> is the sum over the components of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements of P_z, then multiplied by the conjugate of ψ's components.

Wait, more precisely, if the basis states are |z=+h>, |z=0>, |z=-h>, then the state ψ is a linear combination of these. So the expectation value <P_z> is the sum of |c_i|² times the eigenvalues for each state.

So let me write down the eigenvalues of P_z. Looking at the matrix of P_z: the diagonal elements are h, 0, -h. So the possible eigenvalues are +h, 0, -h. Wait, but h is ħ, right? Because in the matrix, the first entry is h, where h is ħ? Oh wait, the operator is denoted as P_z, and its matrix has entries (ħ, 0, 0), (0,0,0), (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, but in the matrix, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenstates are |+> with eigenvalue ħ, |0> with 0, and |-> with -ħ.

Now, the given state ψ is the column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the components are c_+ = -1/2, c_0 = 1/sqrt(2), c_- = -1/2.

Wait, but wait. Let me check: the first component is for the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ, the second for 0, and the third for -ħ. So yes, that's right.

So the expectation value <P_z> is |c_+|² * ħ + |c_0|² * 0 + |c_-|² * (-ħ).

Let me compute each |c_i|².

c_+ = -1/2. So |c_+|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Similarly, c_0 is 1/sqrt(2), so |c_0|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

c_- is -1/2, so |c_-|² = 1/4.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So <P_z> is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, what about <P_z²>? Since P_z squared in this basis is just the square of the eigenvalues, but since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal with entries (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2). So the expectation value <P_z²> is the sum of |c_i|² * (eigenvalue_i)^2.

So each term would be |c_+|²*(ħ)^2, |c_0|²*(0)^2, |c_-|²*(ħ)^2.

So that's (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So <P_z²> = (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of <P_z²> minus <P_z>². Since <P_z> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which is correct. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the components of the state.

The state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the first component is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), and the third is -1/2.

Wait, but I think the first component is the amplitude for eigenstate +ħ, the second for 0, and third for -ħ. So yes, the calculation is correct.

Another way: the expectation value is zero because the probabilities for +ħ and -ħ are equal, and each contributes +ħ and -ħ, so they cancel. The expectation of P_z squared is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ², which is ½ ħ². The square root gives sqrt(½) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2), so option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state given by the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

In the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The state $\psi$ is expressed in this basis, where the components correspond to the eigenstates of $P_z$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_0|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_-|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|c_+|^2$, $|c_0|^2$, and $|c_-|^2$ are the probabilities associated with the eigenstates of $P_z$. From the given state:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_0|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_0|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_-|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
