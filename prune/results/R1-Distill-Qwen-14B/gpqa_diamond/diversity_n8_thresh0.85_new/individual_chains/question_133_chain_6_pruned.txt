Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.

Wait, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Since we're dealing with both KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^- when dissolved) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2- when dissolved), I think this might form a buffer solution. Buffer solutions are usually made with a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. In this case, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (by accepting a proton to become H3PO4). So the pH of the solution must be such that both species are present.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Oh, wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more about the different deprotonated forms. So I think the orthophosphate ion here refers to HPO4^2- and maybe H2PO4^-? Or maybe the problem is considering PO4^3- as orthophosphate. Hmm, no, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it dissociates, the ions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Or is it? Wait no, the problem says orthophosphate ions. Wait, maybe the orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, because that's the form that's commonly referred to in buffers. I'm a bit uncertain about this point.

Wait, the problem is about finding the concentration of
