Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so that likely means that the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ − ⟨A⟩², where A is the operator. So here, A is P_z. But wait, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩.

But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, which is another operator, and P_z and P_x probably don't commute. So the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, meaning the expectation value of P_z might not be straightforward. Hmm, but wait, the state is expressed in terms of the basis vectors of P_z. Oh, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state is already in that basis. So maybe the expectation value of P_z is just the sum of the components multiplied by the eigenvalues?

Wait, let me think again. If the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, then each basis vector |n⟩ corresponds to a specific eigenvalue, say z_n. So if the state is written as a linear combination of these |n⟩, then the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of the probabilities (amplitudes squared) multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Yes, that makes sense. So first, I need to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, which is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, this simplifies to the sum of |c_n|² * z_n, where c_n are the components of the state vector, and z_n are the eigenvalues of P_z for each basis vector.

Looking at the matrix given for P_z, it's a diagonal matrix because in the P_z basis, the operator is diagonal. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. The matrix is:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So the eigenvalues for the basis vectors must be: the first basis vector has eigenvalue ħ (since P_z |1⟩ = ħ |1⟩), the second has 0 (since P_z |2⟩ = 0 |2⟩), and the third has -ħ.

The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the components are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

First, let me compute the probabilities |c_n|².

c1 squared magnitude: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
c2 squared: (1/√2)^2 = 1/
