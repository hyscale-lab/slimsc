Okay, so I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, in this case, there are three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I think I need to figure out what the reaction would be when all three are mixed together.

Wait, maybe I should first calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because the neutralization reactions depend on the amounts of H+ and OH- ions available.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the solutions:

1. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So the moles of HCl will give me moles of H+.

2. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So let's calculate the moles for each.

Starting with HCl:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
Moles HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. So, H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so moles H+ = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

So total H+ available from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.
Total OH- available from base: 0.2 mol.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So the limiting reagent will determine how much reacts.

So comparing H+ and OH-: 0.28 mol H+ vs 0.2 mol OH-. OH- is the limiting reactant. All 0.2 mol OH- will be used.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

But wait, not all the H+ is from HCl. The H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. But since they're both strong acids, they contribute to the total H+.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. Each mole releases about 57 kJ (I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases).

So the total heat released would be moles of H+ (limiting) times the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, the limiting reagent is OH- at 0.2 mol. So the reaction would produce 0.2 mol of water.

So the enthalpy change ΔH would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but the units here are kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so option B is in kcal, others are either kcal or kJ. Did I compute correctly?

Wait, I used 57 kJ per mole, but sometimes it's given as 57.3 kcal per mole. Because 1 cal ≈4.184 J, 1 kJ is about 239 cal. Wait, wait, 1 kcal is 1000 cal. So 57 kJ is approximately 13.66 kcal (because 57 * 1000 J = 57,000 J. 57,000 /4.184 ≈ 13,600 cal, which is 13.6 kcal). Wait, that can't be right because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. But wait, no! Wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. Since 1 cal =4.184 J, 57,000 /4.184 ≈13,600 cal → 13.6 kcal.

Oh wait, but I thought the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol). So in this problem, 0.2 mol would release 0.2 *57= 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4 kJ released (exothermic, so negative: -11.4 kJ). But the options don't have that; option D is -16 kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me see, 11.4 kJ is approximately
