Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The problem starts with compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. We need to identify D from the options given.

Alright, let's start by figuring out what compound A is. The NMR data is key here.

So, A's NMR:
- Triplet at 0.9 ppm, 6H. A triplet usually means that the proton is next to a CH2 group. 6H suggests maybe two equivalent CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2. Or perhaps a (CH2)3 group? Wait, 6H would be two CH3 groups (each 3H), maybe attached to a CH2.

Wait, let me think. A triplet at 0.9 is common for a CH3 group next to a CH2. The 6H means two CH3 groups. So, perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2... Wait, but the other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet implies each of those protons is next to a CH2 group with two neighboring protons. 4H could be two CH2 groups each as adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, maybe A is a di-substituted alkane where each substituent is a CH3 group attached to a CH2CH2. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl group.

Wait, diethyl ether? No, because that would have more signals. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethane or something else.

Wait, another thought: If the triplet is for 6H, that's two sets of 3H each. So maybe two CH3 groups. The quartet is for 4H, which would be two CH2 groups. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2 with each CH2 connected to a CH3. Wait, that would be like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2... Hmm, not exactly. Wait, maybe it's a 4-carbon chain, like CH2CH2CH2CH3 but with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to something. Wait, if it's (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: The triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm is typical for a (CH3)2CH group. No, wait, wait: a (CH3)2CH group would be a triplet, but that's for the CH2. Wait, let me think about the splitting. A triplet for 6H suggests maybe two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, that would have the CH(CH3)2, which is a CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group where each CH2 is connected to two CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's neopentane? No, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which would have a singlet for the central CH and two triplets for the CH3 groups, I think. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: Maybe it's a diethyl group, like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's butane. No, butane would have a quartet and a triplet but perhaps more signals.

Wait, but if it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2X, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane? Let me think about the NMR.

Wait, maybe the structure is 2,2-dimethylpentane? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more symmetrical structure. Wait, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests
