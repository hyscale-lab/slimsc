Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So, first, I remember that any quantum state can be written as a linear combination of basis states. Here, the basis is |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means the spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

Wait, the problem says the state is proportional to that. So, I need to normalize it, right? Because the sum of the probabilities should be 1. So, first step: find the normalization constant.

The state is |alpha> = c * (1+i)|up> + d * (2 -i)|down>, where c and d are the coefficients. The normalization condition is |c|^2 + |d|^2 = 1, but wait, no, I think the state is given as proportional, so the actual state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, but normalized. So, let me calculate the norm of this vector.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because the basis states are orthonormal. So, |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 -i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So total is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question is about probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does that matrix look like?

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (since we're in a two-level system), the matrix A would be:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Because A12 and A21 are ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero. So, this is the matrix for the operator. What does this operator represent? Oh, wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices have similar forms. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if I multiply that by ħ/2, I get [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], which is exactly what A is. So the operator in question is (ħ/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, because scaling by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, just their eigenvalues. So, what are the eigenstates of sigma_x?

The sigma_x matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. The corresponding eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, maybe I should double-check that. Because sigma_x is Hermitian, and its eigenstates are orthogonal.

Wait, to find the eigenstates, let's solve sigma_x |psi> = lambda |psi>. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so:

For lambda = +1: (sigma_x - I) |psi> = 0 → [[-1,1],[1,-1]] |psi> =0. So the equations are -psi_1 + psi_2 =0 and psi_1 - psi_2=0. So psi_1 = psi_2. So the eigenstate is (1, 1)/sqrt(2), which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, for lambda =
