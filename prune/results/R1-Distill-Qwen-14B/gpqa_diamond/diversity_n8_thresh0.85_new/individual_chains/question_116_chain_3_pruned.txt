Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell me about the structure. So, 0.9 ppm is usually around where methyl groups attached to something like a CH2 or maybe a cyclohexane ring. The triplet suggests that these 6H are adjacent to a CH2 group. Because a triplet in NMR usually means coupling with two neighboring protons. So if it's 6H, like maybe two methyl groups each with 3H, but wait, 3H each would give 6H total. Or maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3 group? Wait, no, let me think.

The other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each of these protons is next to a CH2 group with two protons, right? Because each would couple with two others, making a quartet. So 4H could be two CH2 groups each with 2H. Like maybe a CH2CH2 group somewhere.

So putting this together, maybe the structure is something like neopentyl or maybe a cyclohexane derivative. Wait, no. Let's think about common structures. A triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm. That might be two CH2CH3 groups, but each CH2CH3 would have 3H, but as a triplet. Wait, no, wait. If the 6H are split into a triplet, it's likely that they are each adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2CHCH2 something? Or maybe it's a cyclopropane ring? No, probably not.

Wait, another thought: If it's a cyclohexane ring where there are two CH2CH3 groups attached. Like maybe 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane or something like that. Let me think about NMR shifts. Methyl groups on cyclohexane are usually around 0.9 ppm, right? So if the molecule is 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, then each methyl would be next to a CH2 group, which would split the signal into a triplet. And the CH2 groups would be next to two different CH2 groups, each coupling with two protons, leading to a quartet.

Wait, no, the CH2's would be attached to the cyclohexane. So if each methyl is attached to a CH2, then the methyl would be a triplet because each methyl CH3 is next to a CH2 with two protons. Wait, no, wait. The splitting depends on the neighboring protons. So the methyl groups (CH3) would be next to a CH2, which has two protons. So each CH3 would be a triplet because they couple with the two protons of the adjacent CH2. And the CH2 groups would each have two protons which are adjacent to the CH3 and another CH2. So what kind of splitting would the CH2 groups have?

Wait, take the CH2 group between two CH3 groups. Each H on the CH2 would be next to two CH3 groups, but that's not right because the CH3 is
