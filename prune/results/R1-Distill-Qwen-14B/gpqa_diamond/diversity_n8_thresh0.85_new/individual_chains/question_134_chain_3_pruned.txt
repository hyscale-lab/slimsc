Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the question says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that when acids and bases are neutralized, they form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for this reaction is typically measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ), and the options here have both, so I need to pay attention to units.

Wait, but wait. How do I approach this? I think the enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of H+ ions reacting with OH- ions. So I should probably figure out the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which one is the limiting reactant.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4.
3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
4. Find the total moles of H+ and OH-.
5. Determine the limiting reactant because the neutralization depends on which is in lesser quantity.
6. Use the enthalpy per mole of H+ (or OH-) to compute the total enthalpy change.

Wait, but wait. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically for a reaction where one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. So if we have a strong acid and a strong base, the enthalpy is around -57 kcal/mol (or -28.6 kJ/mol if I remember correctly). Wait, wait, I think the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+? Or is it per mole of acid? Hmm, I might be getting mixed up between the two. Let me think. Oh yes, the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and base is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57 kJ of heat. But I need to get the exact value right.

Wait, actually, I might be getting this confused. Let me recall: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is the
