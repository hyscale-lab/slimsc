Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Alright, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions, making them unavailable for other reactions. 

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the K for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I think K here refers to the formation constant, which measures how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. 

So the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Since the complex is Ca-EDTA, each formula unit probably releases one Ca²+ ion when it dissociates. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. The EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it can bind six sites. So the formula for the complex would be Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that. But in solution, the complex dissociates a little.

So the reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²- , right? Because EDTA is usually in the deprotonated form, and when it binds calcium, it loses protons. So the formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA²- ] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). 

Wait, but in this problem, we have the concentration of the complex being 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. Then, it dissociates a bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, because K is so large (5x10^10), that suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation won't be much. So the amount of Ca²+ released would be very small compared to the initial complex concentration.

So let's model this. Let me set up the variables. Let [Ca²+] = x. Since for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So the [EDTA^4-] would also be x, assuming that the initial concentration of free EDTA is negligible (which it probably is, since the complex is 0.02 M and if it's the main source, then EDTA from it would be x). 

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is purely the complex. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero. Then, when the complex dissociates, each gives x of both. So, the equilibrium expression is K = [CaEDTA²- ] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) → K = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = (0.02)/(x²) because x is going to be so small compared to 0.02 that 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting, K = 5e10 ≈ (0.02)/(x²). So solving for x:

x² ≈ 0.02 / (
