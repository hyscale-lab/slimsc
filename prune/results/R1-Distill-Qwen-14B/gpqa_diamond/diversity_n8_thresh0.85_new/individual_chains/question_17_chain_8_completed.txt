Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see what I remember. The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form complexes. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10.

Wait, I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and K is given as 5e10. But wait, I might need to think about the exact stoichiometry. Oh, right, EDTA typically forms a 1:1 complex with metal ions like Ca²+.

So, the complex is Ca-EDTA, and given that the concentration is 0.02 M, that's the total concentration of the complex. I'm trying to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I remember that when a complex dissociates, the concentration of the ions relates to the formation constant. The formula, I think, is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in this case, the solution is at stoichiometric conditions. So initially, we have all the EDTA and Ca²+ in the complex form. I need to find the [Ca²+] when the complex dissociates a little.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA] is approximately equal to the initial concentration because K is so large. Wait, no, K is large, so the complex is stable. So if K is very big, the dissociation is minimal. So the amount of calcium ions in solution would be very small.

Wait, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. Let me set up an ICE table to model the dissociation.

The reaction is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Initially, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA] = 0.

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x.

So the expression for K is:

K = [Ca²+][EDTA] / [CaEDTA] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

But since K is so large (like 5e10), the denominator is approximately 0.02 because x would be very small compared to 0.02. So simplifying:

x² / 0.02 ≈ 5e10 → x² ≈ 5e10 * 0.02 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9.

So x² = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 1e4.5? Wait, sqrt(1e9) is 31622.7766, which is approximately 3.16e4 M? That can't be right because that's way higher than the initial concentration. That doesn't make sense because if x is 3e4, the initial concentration is 0.02 M, which would mean 0.02 - x is negative, which is impossible.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe K is 5e10, which is a very large number. So the denominator (0.02 - x) can't be approximated as 0.02. Maybe x is not negligible. Hmm, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I should rearrange the equation.

Let me write the equation without approximation:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5e10

Multiply both sides by (0.02 - x):

x² = 5e10 * (0.02 - x)

Expanding the right side:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02 - 5e10 x

x² = 1e9 - 5e10 x

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +5e10 x -1e9 =0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c =0, where a=1, b=5e10, c= -1e9.

Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Calculating the discriminant:

b² = (5e10)^2 = 25e20

4ac=4*1*(-1e9) = -4e9

So sqrt(b² -4ac) = sqrt(25e20 +4e9). Since 25e20 is way larger than 4e9, the sqrt is approximately sqrt(25e20) =5e10.

So,

x = [ -5e10 ±5e10 ] / 2

We can ignore the negative solution because concentration can't be negative.

So,

x = ( -5e10 +5e10 ) /2 = 0 → Not correct, because that gives x=0, which isn't possible because the complex does dissociate.

Wait, maybe I should consider the positive square root. Let me re-express the quadratic formula.

x = [ -b + sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a )

So,

x = [ -5e10 + sqrt( (5e10)^2 +4e9 ) ] / 2

As before, the sqrt is approximately 5e10 + (4e9)/(2*5e10) ) → using binomial approximation.

Wait, sqrt(a² + b) ≈ a + b/(2a) when b is much smaller than a².

So, sqrt(25e20 +4e9) ≈5e10 + (4e9)/(2*5e10) ) =5e10 + (4e9)/(1e11) ) =5e10 + 0.04.

So,

x = [ -5e10 +5e10 +0.04 ] /2 → (0.04)/2 → 0.02.

Wait, that would make x=0.02, but then [CaEDTA] = 0.02 -x = 0.02 -0.02=0, which can't be correct because the complex can't completely dissociate.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formation constant is given as Kf, which is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So the initial concentration is 0.02 M for the complex. Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, the EDTA and Ca²+ are in equimolar concentrations. Wait, but the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, meaning maybe the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So the only species present are the complex, and the dissociation produces some Ca²+ and EDTA.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since K is very large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so the concentration of Ca²+ is very low. So perhaps I can approximate that [Ca²+] is much smaller than the initial concentration.

Wait, but when I tried that earlier, I got a concentration that didn't make sense. So maybe I should reconsider the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the total concentration as the sum of the complex and the dissociated ions. So,

Total [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M.

But then, [Ca²+] =x, [EDTA]=x.

So,

K = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) =5e10.

But since K is big, x should be small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So,

x² /0.02 ≈5e10 → x² ≈5e10 *0.02 → 1e9 → x ≈ sqrt(1e9) → 3.16e4 M.

Wait, but that can't be right because x would be 3e4 M, which is way bigger than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. That can't happen. So my initial assumption must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should instead consider that the formation of the complex is reversible, but when the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, the concentrations are such that [Ca²+] = [EDTA], and the total concentration is the sum of the complex and the free ions.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the concentration of a metal ion in a complex solution. The formula I think is [M] = Kf * [Complex] / (1 + Kf [Complex]) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the expression is [M] = (Kf * [Complex]) / (1 + Kf * [Complex]).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Let's say the complex is M-EDTA, and the formation reaction is M + EDTA ↔ M-EDTA, Kf.

The total concentration of M is [M_total] = [M] + [M-EDTA].

But in this problem, when you have 0.02 M M-EDTA, [M-EDTA] =0.02 M, and [M] is x, [EDTA] is x as well, because each M requires an EDTA to form the complex.

Wait, but the total EDTA would be [EDTA_total] = [EDTA] + [M-EDTA]. But if the initial solution is only M-EDTA, then [EDTA] = x, and [M-EDTA] =0.02, so [EDTA_total] = x +0.02.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me approach this more methodically.

The complex is Ca-EDTA. The formation equation is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

In this problem, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the total concentration of EDTA is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-].

But wait, if the initial solution is only the complex, then [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. The free EDTA is [EDTA^4-] = x, and the free Ca²+ is x as well.

So, [EDTA_total] = x +0.02, but in reality, I think the solution might have been made by adding EDTA and Ca²+ in such a way that all the Ca²+ is complexed, so the total EDTA is [EDTA] = [EDTA_free] + 0.02. But perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution is made by having 0.02 M of the complex. So the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M (from the complex) plus the free EDTA. But wait, no, the EDTA is a ligand that binds to Ca²+. So, for each mole of complex, one mole of EDTA is used. So the total EDTA is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-] = x + 0.02.

But in the solution, the amount of free EDTA is x, and the amount of free Ca²+ is x as well (since each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA).

So, the formation constant expression is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = (0.02 -x) / (x * x) = 5e10.

But since Kf is very large, x must be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So, 0.02/(x²) =5e10 → x² = 0.02 /5e10 → x²=4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5... which is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

So the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

### Key Assumptions and Setup:
1. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] = 0.02 - x\), where \(x\) is the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\).
2. Since \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, and \(x\) is much smaller than 0.02. Thus, \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02\).
3. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}
\]

Substituting \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\), \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\), and \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02\), we get:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

### Solving for \(x\):
\[
x^2 = K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot 0.02 = (5 \times 10^{10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1 \times 10^9
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1 \times 10^9} = 3.16 \times 10^4 \, \text{M}
\]

This result is unreasonably large, indicating a mistake in the approximation. Revisiting the assumption, the correct approach is to solve the quadratic equation derived from:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
x^2 = K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot (0.02 - x)
\]

\[
x^2 + K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot x - K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot 0.02 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a = 1\), \(b = K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}\), and \(c = -K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \cdot 0.02 = -1 \times 10^9\). Substituting:

\[
x = \frac{-5 \times 10^{10} \pm \sqrt{(5 \times 10^{10})^2 - 4(1)(-1 \times 10^9)}}{2(1)}
\]

\[
x = \frac{-5 \times 10^{10} \pm \sqrt{25 \times 10^{20} + 4 \times 10^9}}{2}
\]

Since \(25 \times 10^{20} \gg 4 \times 10^9\), the discriminant simplifies to:

\[
\sqrt{25 \times 10^{20}} = 5 \times 10^{10}
\]

Thus:

\[
x = \frac{-5 \times 10^{10} + 5 \times 10^{10}}{2} = \frac{0.04}{2} = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

This result is also unphysical, as it implies complete dissociation. Reassessing, the correct solution involves recognizing that \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 and using the approximation \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02\). Solving:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).

### Final Answer:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is **6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option **C**.
