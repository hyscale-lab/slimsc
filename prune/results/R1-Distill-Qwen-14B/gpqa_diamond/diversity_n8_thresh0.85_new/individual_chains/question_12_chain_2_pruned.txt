Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Find the KE of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary, and the rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon. The options are A to D with different pairs of energies.

Hmm. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after the decay should be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have almost negligible mass. I think the standard model says neutrinos have very tiny masses, but for many problems, especially if not stated otherwise, we treat them as massless. But wait, in this problem, the rest mass of the neutrino isn't given. Hmm, because in the decay Pi+ → mu+ + nu, the neutrino is a product. But if its rest mass isn't provided, maybe we can treat it as massless.

So let me outline the approach. 

First, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But if the neutrino is massless, then its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c squared (but units are in MeV, so perhaps c=1 in these units). Wait, we use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, so E = |p| for massless particles.

But the muon has rest mass, so its energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). 

The total energy must be conserved. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary—E_initial = m_pi c², but again, with c=1, E_initial = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy plus the neutrino's energy. So E_total = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = |p| (since it's massless). Also, since the momenta are opposite, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, then E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p.

So, the total energy after decay is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Wait, that's an equation in terms of p. Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)²) + p = 139.6

Hmm, how do I solve for p here.

Let me set x = p for simplicity.

So, sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me isolate the square root term:

sqrt(x²
