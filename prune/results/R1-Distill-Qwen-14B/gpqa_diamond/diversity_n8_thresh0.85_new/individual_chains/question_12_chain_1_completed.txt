Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, which probably simplifies things a bit.

Wait, the question gives the rest masses. Pion is 139.6 MeV, muon is 105.7 MeV. Oh right, because the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta should cancel each other out.

I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But neutrinos are super light, right? I think their rest mass is negligible. So the neutrino's momentum would be approximately equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the muon's.

Wait, but how does that help me find their kinetic energies? Let me think.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero (approximate). The muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy.

So, let's denote the muon's kinetic energy as KE_mu and the neutrino's as KE_nu. The muon's total energy is then 105.7 + KE_mu, and the neutrino's is KE_nu.

Energy conservation: 139.6 = (105.7 + KE_mu) + KE_nu.

But I also need to consider momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so total momentum is zero. So the magnitude of the muon's momentum equals that of the neutrino's. Let's denote the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p (in opposite direction), but since neutrino's mass is negligible, we'll approximate that p is the same.

Wait, but the muon's momentum is related to its kinetic energy. For non-relativistic speeds, KE is (1/2)mv², but muons are moving at relativistic speeds here. So maybe I should think in terms of relativistic energy-momentum relations.

The energy of the muon is the total energy, which is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, units-wise, maybe it's better to work in units where c=1. So energy is sqrt(p^2 + m^2).

So for the muon: E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV. And for the neutrino: E_nu = p, since m_nu is approximately zero.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

So sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, okay, that seems manageable. Let's let x = p. So the equation is sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6.

Let me compute 105.7 squared. 105.7 * 105.7. Let's see: 100² is 10000, 5.7² is ~32.49, and the cross terms are 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 approximately. So 105.7² ≈ 11172.49 (MeV²).

So the equation becomes sqrt(x² + 11172.49) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² + 11172.49) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides: x² + 11172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 *x + x².

So: x² + 11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 279.2 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 279.2 x.

Compute (139.6)^2: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, and cross terms are 2*139 *0.6 = 166.8. So 19321 +166.8 +0.36= 19488.16. So 139.6^2 is about 19488.16.

So:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearranging: 279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49: 19488 -11172 is 8316, and 0.16-0.49= -0.33, so 8316 -0.33= 8315.67? So 8315.67.

Wait, wait, let me compute it properly:

19488.16  
-11172.49  
= ?

Subtracting:

19488.16

-11172.49

= 8315.67.

So 279.2 x = 8315.67.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

279.2 is about 280. Let me do exact division:

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me see: 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Well, 279.2 *30=8376. So that's 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67.

Wait, 8376 - 8315.67 = 60.33. So 279.2 * 30 = 8376.

But 8315.67 is 60.33 less than 8376. So 279.2 * (30 - delta) = 8315.67.

Let me find delta.

60.33 = 279.2 * delta.

delta ≈60.33 / 279.2 ≈ 0.216.

So x ≈30 -0.216 = 29.784 ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but x is p, which is the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum. So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is p as well. Hmm, but in opposite directions. So the muon's momentum is 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, what's the muon's kinetic energy? The total energy of the muon is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = E_mu.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

Compute that:

29.78^2 is approximately 887 (since 30^2 is 900, so 29.78^2 ≈ 887).

105.7^2 is 11172 as before.

So sqrt(887 + 11172) = sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7, so KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV, but that's its kinetic energy since it's massless.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be precise.

Wait, the value of x was about 29.78 MeV.

So the neutrino's KE is x, which is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, in the energy equation:

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

E_mu is 109.81 MeV, E_nu is 29.78, so 109.81 +29.78 ≈ 139.59, which is approximately 139.6. So it checks out.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me check another approach. Maybe using energy-momentum conservation more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the available energy for the decay.

The decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu.

The rest mass of Pi+ is 139.6 MeV. The muon has 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is negligible.

So the Q-value of the reaction (the total energy released) is (139.6 -105.7) =33.9 MeV.

So the total energy available is 33.9 MeV. But this is the sum of the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino, since the pion is at rest.

Wait, but wait: the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest energy is 105.7. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

So the available energy is 139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. But that's the kinetic energy plus any rest mass energy changes.

Wait, no, because the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So the energy after decay is the muon's energy (rest plus kinetic) plus neutrino's kinetic energy. So the sum of the kinetic energies is 33.9 MeV.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave the muon KE of about 4.1 MeV and neutrino of 29.8 MeV, which adds up to about 33.9 MeV. So that aligns.

So the KEs are 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8.

So that must be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process **π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν** where the pion is stationary. The rest masses of the pion and muon are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The neutrino is assumed to be massless. The goal is to determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Here, \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} + KE_{\mu}\) (rest energy plus kinetic energy of the muon), and \(E_{\nu} = KE_{\nu}\) (neutrino's kinetic energy, as its rest mass is negligible).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
   \]  
   For the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Solving for Kinetic Energies
From energy conservation:  
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = 139.6.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), we solve for \(p_{\mu}\). Let \(x = p_{\mu}\). The equation becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x = 139.6.
\]  
Subtracting \(x\) from both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - x.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x + x^2.
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]  
\[
279.2x = 8315.67.
\]  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Thus, \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

The neutrino's kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\nu} = p_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

For the muon, its total energy is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.11 MeV** and **29.78 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
