Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology techniques, specifically involving transgenic mice and expression constructs. Hmm, let me try to parse through this step by step.

So, the setup is that someone has identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. Interesting structural details, but maybe not directly relevant to the question.

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector has two coding regions: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, often used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is under the control of an IRES element, which I think is an internal ribosome entry site. IRES elements allow for the expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct because they provide a site for ribosome entry, allowing the second ORF to be translated after the first. So the ligand would be expressed from the CBA promoter, then the IRES would drive the receptor's expression.

Now, there are stop cassettes in between. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for the Cre recombinase. Cre can excise the DNA between two loxP sites. So the stop cassettes would prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins unless Cre is present to excise the stop.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, which probably means the proteins are being expressed. So the constructs are working in vitro when transfected into primary astrocyte cultures.

Then, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre is under the control of SOX10, so in neural crest cells, Cre would be expressed. When Cre is present, it should recombine the lox sites.

Wait, but the two stop cassettes are different: loxP and lox2272. I think that lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site that is recognized by Cre but has a different arrangement. The key thing is that Cre can only recombine similar lox sites. So, loxP and lox2272 are different and cannot recombine with each other. So, each stop cassette would need to have the same lox sites to be excised by Cre.

So, if the ligand is under a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and the receptor under lox2272-stop-lox2272, then Cre, which is present in the SOX10-Cre mice, would excise both stops only if it can recognize both. But wait, no. Actually, each stop cassette is flanked by its own lox sites.

Wait, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in the loxP cassette. So when Cre is introduced, it will excise the loxP-stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor has a stop in the lox2272 cassette; Cre would excise that, allowing receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But wait, in the bicistronic construct, the first gene is ligand-mCherry, followed by a stop in lo
