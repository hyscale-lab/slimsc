Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism usually has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically when a compound has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Right, chiral centers are key here because they're atoms attached to four different groups, which means the molecule can have enantiomers.

Let me go through each of the given compounds one by one to see if they exhibit optical isomerism.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1, and on each ring, there are nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. Wait, biphenyl compounds can have some kind of stereoisomerism, right? If the substituents are on opposite sides or the same side, but I'm not sure. Oh, wait, for biphenyls, the substituents can lead to E/Z isomerism if the groups are on adjacent positions. But more importantly, for optical isomerism, you need a chiral center or some kind of planar chirality. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomerism. So looking at the substituents on the biphenyl: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are the substituents arranged symmetrically? If the structure is such that the groups on the two rings mirror each other, then maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral. So if each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the biphenyl is connected at 1, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Wait, the positions are 6,6' and 2,2', so the substituents on each ring are at the same positions. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond, making it achiral. But wait, what about the possibility of the biphenyl ring having a twist? If the twist leads to different configurations on each side, could that cause chirality? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the substituents themselves create a chiral center. But the substituents are on the phenyl rings, which are connected to each other. Maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Or perhaps it does, if the arrangement of substituents leads to a non-superimposable mirror image. Hmm, not sure. I'll come back to this one.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw that. The structure would be: the ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOH. Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH? Or wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. Wait, but that structure has a chiral center. The carbon with the OH, CH2, COO, and CH3? Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CO
