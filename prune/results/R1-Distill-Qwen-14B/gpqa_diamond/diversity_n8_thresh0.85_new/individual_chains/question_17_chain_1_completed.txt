Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY²- or something like that. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. A large Kf means the complex is stable.

So the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Oh right, because the complex dissociates a little into Ca²+ and EDTA ions.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I need to use the formation constant expression. The formation constant Kf is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is a big number, so the complex is stable, meaning the dissociation isn't much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very low.

The formula for Kf is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration of the complex. Let's denote [CaEDTA²−] as 0.02 M.

But wait, in solution, some of the EDTA might be in different forms because EDTA has multiple protons and is a polyprotic acid. But the problem says pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its Y^4- form. So we don't have to worry about the different species of EDTA; it's already deprotonated enough.

So, assuming that [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, and the solution is at equilibrium. The initial concentrations before dissociation are [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both approximately zero because the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, that's not right. Actually, each mole of CaEDTA²− dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So if x is the amount that dissociates, then:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x
And [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 because Kf is so large that x is very small compared to 0.02.

So plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(4e-13) is a bit less. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that matches one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the concentration of Ca²+.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me rework the numbers.

Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Assuming [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So 5e10 = (0.02) / (x²) → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4) is 2; sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4 * 1e-13) ) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * (1e-6.5) → 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The EDTA is present as Y^4- because the solution is at the ideal pH. So the assumption is correct that [EDTA^4-] is x. So the conclusion is correct.

So the answer should be option C: 6.3x10^-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\), is 0.02 M. Assuming the dissociation of the complex is minimal (due to the large \( K_f \)), the dissociation can be represented as:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
