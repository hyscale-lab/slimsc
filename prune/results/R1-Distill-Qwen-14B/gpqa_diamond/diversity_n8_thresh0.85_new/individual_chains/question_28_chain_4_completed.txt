Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Then it's treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine to form product 1. Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2. Then product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl to give product 4, which is the final product. I need to figure out what product 4 looks like.

Hmm, let's break this down into each step.

First Step: (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + t-BDMSCl and triethylamine.

Wait, t-BDMSCl is tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride. I remember that silyl chlorides are often used to protect hydroxyl groups. Triethylamine is a base, so it probably deprotonates the hydroxyl to make it a better leaving group. So in the first step, the hydroxyl group (OH) on the cyclohexenone is being protected as a silyl ether. So product 1 would have an O-Si group where the OH was.

So the structure after step 1 would be 4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the OH is at position 4. After protection, the OH becomes O-Si.

Second Step: Product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi and then benzyl bromide.

Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent. I remember that Gilman reagents are used for conjugate additions. Since product 1 is a cyclohexenone, it's a conjugated enone. So the Gilman reagent will perform a 1,4-addition to the enone.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. The starting enone is cyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, I think. The ketone is at C1.

So when Ph2CuLi does a conjugate addition, it adds the aryl group (from the Gilman reagent) to the gamma position. The mechanism of conjugate addition typically adds the nucleophile (like the aryllithium from Ph2CuLi) to the beta carbon, but wait, maybe I should draw this.

Alternatively, the conjugate addition to a ketone. The enone is:

O
||
C1 - C2 double bond to C3 - C4-O-SiR3 (since it's the silyl ether).

So, the positions are:

1: ketone.

2 and 3: double bond.

4: silyl ether.

So, the conjugate addition would add the Gilman's R group (Ph) to C3. Wait, wait. The enolate would form, but wait, the Gilman reagent adds to the carbonyl group in a conjugate fashion.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the mechanism. The enone has the structure:

O
||
C1=C2-C3-O-SiR3

Wait, no, cyclohexenone is a six-membered ring with a ketone and a double bond. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with the ketone at position 1, the double bond between 2 and 3, and the OH (now O-Si) at position 4.

So when the Gilman reagent attacks, it adds to the gamma position, which in this case would be position 3. Wait, but the numbering might be a bit different. Let me think: in cyclohex-2-en-1-one, the ketone is at C1, double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the positions are:

1: carbonyl.

2: double bond to 3.

3: next to carbonyl.

Wait, so the conjugate addition would add the R group (Ph) to C3. So, the Gilman reagent would add a phenyl group to position 3.

So after the conjugate addition, the product would have a phenyl group added to position 3, with the silyl ether still at position 4.

Wait, but the sequence is: after adding Ph2CuLi, then benzyl bromide. Wait, no, wait, Ph2CuLi is the reagent, then benzyl bromide is added.

Wait, no, the question says: product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temp, followed by benzyl bromide. So, perhaps the steps are: first, the conjugate addition of the Gilman reagent, then a benzyl bromide addition.

Wait, but Ph2CuLi is used for conjugate additions, adding the aryl group. So the first step after product 1 is the addition of Ph group to the enone.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The reagent is Ph2CuLi, which is a cuprate. So when it reacts with the enone, it does a 1,4-addition. So the phenyl group (from Ph2CuLi) would add to the gamma position (C3) of the ketone. Then, perhaps after quenching, they add benzyl bromide. Or maybe I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, another possibility: After the conjugate addition by the cuprate, the benzyl bromide might function as an electrophilic reagent. But wait, maybe the cuprate adds the phenyl group first, then a benzyl group is added elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds a benzyl group instead of a phenyl. Wait, no, the cuprate is Ph2CuLi, which has phenyl groups. Oh wait no, wait, Ph2CuLi is a diphenyl cuprate. So the addition would bring in a phenyl group. Then, maybe another step.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a two-step process: the first addition is the conjugate addition of diphenyl cuprate, then the benzyl bromide is added via an organometallic reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is a separate alkylation step.

Wait, perhaps the initial conjugate addition adds the phenyl group, leading to a new structure. Let me imagine the product after the cuprate addition.

The enone (product 1) has the structure of cyclohex-2-en-1-one with a silyl ether at position 4. The conjugate addition of Ph2CuLi would add a phenyl group to the gamma position, which is position 3. So position 3 would have a phenyl substituent.

So after the cuprate addition, the product would have a phenyl group at C3. But wait, how does that work? The enone is at positions 1, 2, 3. The cuprate adds to position 3.

Wait, perhaps the product after the cuprate addition is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1, a phenyl group at position 3, and the silyl ether at position 4. But wait, the positions are in a ring, so the numbering might be a bit different.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexenone is a six-membered ring with the ketone at 1, double bond between 2 and 3, and the silyl ether at 4. So in the conjugate addition, the phenyl group would add to position 3. So the product after this step (product 2) would have a phenyl at C3.

But then the next step is adding benzyl bromide. Wait, benzyl bromide is a good electrophile; maybe we're doing some kind of alkylation.

Wait, but after the cuprate addition, perhaps the ring is more substituted. Let me think about the structure again. The original structure is a cyclohexenone with the OH (now O-TBS) at position 4. After the cuprate addition, the phenyl is added to position 3, making the ring have substituents at 3 and 4.

Wait, but then after that, how does benzyl bromide come into play?

Alternatively, maybe the cuprate addition gives a new structure that can undergo another reaction. Wait, perhaps after the cuprate adds the phenyl group, the next step is an alkylation with benzyl bromide, which could be an SN2 reaction or perhaps another conjugate addition. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order. The problem says product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi and then benzyl bromide. So perhaps the steps are: first the conjugate addition of Ph from the cuprate, and then the benzyl bromide is added in a separate step. Maybe it's a benzylation via another nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but after the cuprate addition, the product would have a phenyl group attached. Then maybe benzyl bromide is a benzyl electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the conjugate addition, and then the benzyl bromide is added as an alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, making an enolate, and then the benzyl bromide is added to the same position. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, giving a new carbon-carbon bond. Then, the benzyl bromide would add via an alkylation.

Wait, perhaps it's a two-step addition: first the phenyl from the cuprate, then the benzyl from the bromide.

Wait, but the order is important. Let me try to outline:

1. Enone (product 1) reacts with Ph2CuLi → conjugate addition at position 3 → product A.

2. Product A is treated with benzyl bromide → perhaps an alkylation at a different position.

Wait, but if the first step adds a phenyl at C3, then the next step with benzyl bromide might add a benzyl group elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe after the conjugate addition, the silyl ether is deprotected, but I don't think so because the next step is with benzyl bromide.

Wait, maybe the conjugate addition is followed by an alkyne or another reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is part of a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the benzyl bromide is a benzyl Grignard or something else, but in this case, it's just benzyl bromide, which is an alkylating agent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on to the next steps and see if that helps.

Third step: product 2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane. LDA is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate things. Iodomethane is a methylating agent.

So, when LDA is used with iodomethane, it likely deprotonates a position and then methylates it. So perhaps it's an alkylation where a proton is abstracted, and then a methyl group is added.

Wait, but LDA is such a strong base that it can deprotonate very acidic protons, like alpha to carbonyl groups. So in product 2, which has a ketone (at C1), LDA would deprotonate the alpha position (maybe C2 or C5, depending on the structure), forming an enolate, which could then attack the methyl iodide (CH3I), adding a methyl group at the alpha position.

So in product 3, we would have a methyl group added at an alpha position of the ketone.

Then, the final step is treating product 3 with aqueous HCl. That would protonate any enolates or silyl ethers, perhaps removing the silyl protecting group.

Wait, but the silyl ether is at C4 in the starting material. After the first step, the silyl ether is still present. Then, after the conjugate addition, the silyl ether is still present. Then after the LDA and CH3I steps, the silyl ether is still present. So in the final step, when aqueous HCl is added, the silyl ether would be hydrolyzed back to the OH group.

So putting this together:

Starting Material: (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Step 1: Protect OH as O-TBS. So product 1 is 4-TBSO-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Step 2: Add Ph2CuLi → conjugate addition adds phenyl to C3. Then, benzyl bromide is added. Wait, but I'm not sure where. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is adding to the same position or another position.

Wait, maybe after the conjugate addition, the enone is converted into a cyclohexane ring with substituents. Let me think: the enone (product 1) is treated with Ph2CuLi, which adds the phenyl group to the gamma position (C3), giving a new cyclohexane ring with a phenyl at C3, a silyl ether at C4, and the ketone at C1.

So now, product 2 would have a phenyl at C3, a silyl ether at C4, and a ketone at C1.

Then, product 2 is treated with LDA and CH3I. LDA would deprotonate an alpha hydrogen (say, at C2), form an enolate, which would react with CH3I to add a methyl group at C2.

So product 3 would have a methyl group at C2, a phenyl at C3, silyl ether at C4, and a ketone at C1.

Finally, treating with HCl would remove the silyl ether, replacing it with an OH group at C4.

So, the final product (product 4) would have a cyclohexanone ring (since the ketone remains), with substituents at C2, C3, and C4.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, but I thought the benzyl would come from benzyl bromide. Oh wait, in step 2, after the conjugate addition with Ph2CuLi, perhaps the benzyl bromide is adding a benzyl group elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine step 2.

Wait, product 1 is the silyl ether. Then, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi, which adds a phenyl group via conjugate addition. Then, followed by benzyl bromide. So perhaps after the phenyl addition, the benzyl bromide is added via, say, an alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: after the conjugate addition of Ph2CuLi, the product is a cyclohexane ring with a phenyl group at C3, silyl ether at C4, and a ketone at C1.

Then, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added in an alkylation at another position. Let's say, LDA in the next step would deprotonate a different position.

Wait, but the third step is treating product 2 with LDA and CH3I.

Wait, perhaps after the conjugate addition, the ring structure is such that LDA can deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the ketone, leading to alkylation with CH3I.

So, let's try to reconstruct:

Step 1: Protect OH at C4 → O-TBS.

Step 2: Conjugate addition adds phenyl at C3.

Structure: cyclohexanone, C1; C3 has phenyl, C4 has O-TBS.

Step 3: LDA deprotonates an alpha position (like C2), adds methyl from CH3I.

So now, C2 has methyl group.

Step 4: HCl hydrolyzes O-TBS → OH at C4.

So the final structure would have:

- C1: ketone.

- C2: methyl.

- C3: phenyl.

- C4: hydroxyl.

The cyclohexanone ring would have a methyl at C2, phenyl at C3, OH at C4.

But looking at the options, option C is (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, no, option C has 2-benzyl, 2-methyl, which doesn't fit what I just thought. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps. Let me try another approach.

Perhaps the benzyl bromide comes into play in step 2. So after the conjugate addition with Ph2CuLi, which adds the phenyl group, the next step is treatment with benzyl bromide.

So perhaps the benzyl bromide is doing a benzyl addition elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the silyl ether is present, making the OH a good leaving group. So after the conjugate addition, maybe an alkylation occurs at the silyl ether position.

Wait, but the silyl ether is a good leaving group under certain conditions, but perhaps in step 2, the O-TBS is deprotected, but I don't think so because the reaction with t-BDMSCl is the first step, and the next steps don't mention acidic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is acting as an electrophile, and the ring is undergoing some kind of alkylation.

Wait, maybe the product after the conjugate addition is an enolate, which can attack the benzyl bromide. So after the conjugate addition, the ring has a phenyl group, and then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group in an alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-step addition: first the phenyl, then the benzyl.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: 2-benzyl, 4-hydroxy, 6-methyl, 3-phenyl. So that's four substituents.

Option B: 2-benzyl, 4-hydroxy, 2-methyl, 3-phenyl.

Option C: 2-benzyl, 2-methyl, 3-phenyl, 4-hydroxy.

Option D: something else with a benzyl ether and a biphenyl structure.

Wait, perhaps the benzyl group is added via benzyl bromide after the conjugate addition.

Wait, maybe the conjugate addition adds a phenyl group, then the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group via an SN2 reaction.

Wait, but where would the benzyl group go? Maybe at position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added to the oxygen of the silyl ether, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me see another angle.

Another approach is to look for the stereochemistry of each step.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. The configuration at C4 is S.

After step 1, the OH is protected as O-TBS, so the configuration remains S.

In step 2, the conjugate addition adds the phenyl group. I think that the configuration at C4 remains S, as the addition is at C3.

In step 3, when LDA deprotonates an alpha hydrogen, say at C2, and methyl is added, the configuration at C2 would depend on the site of deprotonation and the addition. If LDA deprotonates C2, then the methyl group would be added to C2.

In the final step, when the silyl ether is removed, the OH is generated at C4, which would retain the S configuration.

Looking at the options, option B has 2R,3R,4S. Option C has 2S,3S,4S.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Protect OH as O-TBS.

2. Conjugate addition of Ph2CuLi adds a phenyl group to C3.

3. Then, benzyl bromide is added via alkylation to another position, perhaps C2.

4. Then, treatment with LDA and CH3I adds a methyl group, maybe at a different position.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl bromide is added via a benzannulation or some other process, but I can't see that right now.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall process.

The second step: product 1 (the enone with O-TBS) is treated with Ph2CuLi, which adds the phenyl group to C3 in a conjugate addition. Then, benzyl bromide is added. How?

Wait, perhaps the benzyl bromide is adding to the oxygen, but that doesn't fit. Or perhaps it's an alkylation of an enolate.

Wait, maybe after the conjugate addition, LDA and benzyl bromide are used in another step. But no, step 2 is adding Ph2CuLi and then benzyl bromide.

Wait, another possibility: the benzyl bromide is being used as an electrophile for an alkyne or another group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the conjugate addition by Ph2CuLi adds a phenyl group to C3, and the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to C2 in an alkylation step.

Wait, but how would that happen? After the conjugate addition, perhaps the molecule is set up for an alkylation at C2.

So, the product after step 2 would have a phenyl at C3 and a benzyl at C2, along with the silyl ether at C4.

Then, in step 3, treatment with LDA and CH3I would add a methyl group somewhere. If LDA deprotonates C2 (which now has a benzyl group), perhaps it's harder to deprotonate because of the bulky substituent. Alternatively, maybe it deprotonates a different position, adds methyl there.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the options and try to match.

Option C is (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

Hmm, that has a benzyl at C2 and a phenyl at C3. Also, a methyl at C2 and OH at C4.

But wait, can a carbon have both a benzyl and a methyl group? Yes, but in that case, the structure would have multiple substituents on the same carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyl group is at C2 and the phenyl at C3, with a methyl at another position.

Wait, perhaps the benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group at C2, and the LDA step adds a methyl elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyl group is at C2, the phenyl at C3, and the methyl at C6 (as in option A), but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure has a benzyl group at C2, a methyl at C2 (maybe a geminal di-substitution?), a phenyl at C3, and the OH at C4.

But that seems crowded. So maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think again.

In step 1: O-TBS is at C4.

Step 2: Conjugate addition adds phenyl at C3. Then, benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group at C2 via alkylation.

So product 2 has a benzyl at C2, phenyl at C3, O-TBS at C4.

Step 3: LDA deprotonates alpha to ketone, perhaps at C5 or C2, but if C2 already has a benzyl, it's harder. Maybe C5 is deprotonated, adding methyl from CH3I at C5.

But that doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is added at C2.

Wait, but in that case, C2 would have both benzyl and methyl groups, which option C has 2-benzyl and 2-methyl.

So, in product 3, after treatment with LDA and CH3I, the structure would have:

C1: ketone.

C2: benzyl and methyl (from CH3I addition?)

C3: phenyl.

C4: O-TBS.

Then, after HCl treatment, the O-TBS becomes OH.

So the final structure would have a benzyl and methyl on C2, phenyl on C3, and OH on C4.

Which matches option C: (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

Yes, this makes sense. So the correct answer would be option C.


The problem involves a multi-step synthesis starting with (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Step 1**: The hydroxyl group at C4 is protected as a silyl ether using tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (t-BDMSCl) and triethylamine. This forms 4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)cyclohex-2-en-1-one (product 1).

2. **Step 2**: Product 1 reacts with Ph₂CuLi, a Gilman reagent, which performs a conjugate addition to the enone system. The phenyl group (Ph) is added to the gamma position (C3), resulting in a cyclohexane ring with a phenyl group at C3, a silyl ether at C4, and a ketone at C1. Benzyl bromide is then introduced, likely adding a benzyl group to C2 via alkylation. This forms product 2, which has a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, and a silyl ether at C4.

3. **Step 3**: Product 2 is treated with LDA (a strong base) and iodomethane (CH₃I). LDA deprotonates an alpha hydrogen, likely at C2, and the methyl group from CH₃I is added to C2. This forms product 3, which has a methyl group at C2 in addition to the benzyl group already present there.

4. **Step 4**: Product 3 is treated with aqueous HCl, which hydrolyzes the silyl ether at C4, restoring the hydroxyl group. The final product (product 4) is a cyclohexanone ring with a methyl group at C2, a benzyl group at C2, a phenyl group at C3, and a hydroxyl group at C4.

### Stereochemistry and Final Structure:
- The starting material has an (S)-configuration at C4, which is retained through the synthesis.
- The final product has the following substituents:
  - A methyl group at C2.
  - A benzyl group at C2.
  - A phenyl group at C3.
  - A hydroxyl group at C4.
- This matches the description of option C: (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect because it includes a methyl group at C6, which is not formed in the synthesis.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it describes a 2R,3R configuration, which does not match the stereochemistry of the synthesis.
- **Option C**: Correct because it accurately describes the substituents and stereochemistry of the final product.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it describes a structure with a benzyl ether and a biphenyl system, which is not formed in the synthesis.

ANSWER: C
