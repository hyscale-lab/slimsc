Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. I think the period relates to the size of the orbit, but wait, Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, but since the masses of the stars are different, that might complicate things.

Wait, the stars' masses are different. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. So, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same size. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, no, I think it's more like the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) divided by the semi-major axis, but only if the orbit is edge-on. Oh wait, actually, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, but I might be mixing things up.

Let me think again. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. The probability is highest when the orbital plane is edge-on. The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star/(a) * (1) - but wait, no. Another source I read before said the probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by something else, perhaps a geometric factor based on the alignment.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)), where e is the orbital eccentricity. But in this case, both planets have circular orbits (e=0), so that term is 1. So it's (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately
