Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. I remember that molecular formulas can give clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plug in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I did the formula wrong. The correct formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for this compound: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 â†’ (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees. Each double bond or ring is one, and each triple bond is two, etc. So that could mean a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds, so 3 degrees) plus a double bond or ring elsewhere. Or maybe a benzene ring and an enal (double bond and ring), but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H-NMR has several signals:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That seems like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That could be aromatic protons. Maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests they're each coupled to one proton.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another aromatic set. Maybe another para-substituted ring or adjacent substitution.

Wait, but wait. There are two doublets each integrating to 2H. Could this structure have two aromatic rings, each with two protons in a para arrangement? Like each ring has two substituents, creating a doublet each. Or maybe one ring with substituents that cause those signals.

Next, 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could indicate some kind of
