Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. Hmm.

First, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of esters. Oh wait, no, wait—wait, no, wait a minute. I think red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of esters to acids. Because, I recall that when you treat an ester with a strong acid like HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it usually leads to the cleavage of the ester, converting it into a carboxylic acid. So maybe compound X is an ester.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks at 3400–2500 cm^-1 suggest an -OH stretch, but wait, wait. Oh no, wait, the broad peak is usually from an -OH group. But wait, looking again, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of an ester group (C=O). Also, the peaks at around 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 might be from aromatic rings—like C=C stretching. So maybe there's an aromatic ring in the compound.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, which might be an -OH proton, but wait, in an ester, the -OH would be part of the hydroxyl group, but that's usually a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid after reaction, but wait, no—if it's an ester reacting, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the initial compound is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right, that's the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So the product would be a carboxylic acid. So the starting compound X is an ester.

Looking at the NMR data again. Let's go through it:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an -OH from either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if X is an ester, then after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So the product would have a -COOH group, which shows a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in the NMR of X, which is the starting material, it's possible that there's an -OH from somewhere else, like an aromatic alcohol? Or maybe it's part of the ester?

Wait, no, the ester's -O- is part of the oxygen, but the -OH would be in the alcohol part of the ester. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so the -O- is in the ester linkage, but the R-O would have an -OH if it's a hydroxyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the NMR is of the product. Wait, no, the question says that compound X has the given IR and NMR data. So X is the starting material. So in X, maybe the NMR doesn't show a -OH, but after the reaction, the product would have a -COOH group, which would have a peak around 10.5 ppm. But let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material X is a ketone. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more typical for esters or maybe aldehydes. Aldehyde C=O is around 1700-1720, but the absence of a strong peak around 2820 (for the aldehyde -CH stretch) might suggest it's not an aldehyde. So more likely an ester.

Let me look at the NMR again. The peaks:

- 10.5 ppm: Broad singlet, 1H. Could be an -OH group. If X is an ester, perhaps it's an aromatic ester, like phenyl ester. So the -O- would be attached to the benzene ring. Then, the -OH would be part of the R-O- group, but wait, in an ester R-O-CO-R', the R-O- is an alkoxy group, not OH. Oh, wait, no, the R-O- is an alkyl group attached to the oxygen. So in an ester, the oxygen is part of the R-O-CO-R' structure. So where would the -OH be in the starting material?

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is not from an -OH but something else. Could it be an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But an aldehyde would be around 9-10, and a broad peak could suggest some exchange, but aldehydes are usually sharp. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like in a phenol?

Wait, in the NMR, let's see: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, integrating to 1H. So perhaps that's an -OH group from an alcohol, but why would an ester have an -OH? Because if X is an ester, then it's R-O-CO-R', but in that structure, both R and R' are alkyl groups, so the O is connected to R and COOR'. So maybe the -OH is elsewhere in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a secondary alcohol or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is from a carboxylic acid, but then X would be the acid, which doesn't make sense because the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. Hmm.

Wait, but X is the starting material. So if X is an ester, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So the product would have a -COOH group.

But looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4, connected to a propanoic acid.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 4, and a -COOH group attached to the benzene.

Wait, no. Benzoic acid is a benzene ring connected to a -COOH group. So 4-(sec-butyl)benzo
