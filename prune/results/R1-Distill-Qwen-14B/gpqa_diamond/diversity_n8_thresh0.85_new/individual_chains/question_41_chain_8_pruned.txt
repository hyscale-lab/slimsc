Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative motion and light, it's all about how different reference frames perceive things. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact concepts here. Let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, right? And the observer is in the lab, which is presumably the stationary frame in this scenario. Because the glass is moving, the light's speed relative to the lab might be affected by the glass's velocity. But wait, I'm a bit confused because light's speed in a medium is different from its speed in a vacuum. Oh, right, in a medium, light slows downâ€”so the speed is c divided by n, where c is the vacuum speed of light.

Wait, but the problem says to take c as 1. So the speed of light in the glass is v_light = 1/n, right? Because normally, v = c/n. But in this scenario, the glass itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Oh, right, I think this is a case where you have to consider the velocity of the medium (glass) and the velocity of light within that medium. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light inside the glass is moving at v_light = (1/n) relative to the glass. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed relative to the glass, but wait, only if they're in the same direction.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because velocities don't just add up like that in all cases. Oh wait, in classical mechanics, velocities do add up when the speeds are much less than c. But since we're dealing with light here, which has a speed close to 1 (since c=1), maybe relativistic effects come into play. But wait, the problem might be assuming non-relativistic speeds because it's not stated otherwise. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v. If v is much smaller than c, then perhaps we can use a non-relativistic approach. Alternatively, if the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's expecting the use of the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the options involve terms
