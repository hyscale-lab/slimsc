Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products. Hmm, I need to find the starting materials A and B that when treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, give specific enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The options are A to D, each giving different compounds for A and B. 

First, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they work under different conditions. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce ketones, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, LiBH4 can also reduce esters and amides, but BH3 is usually used for the reduction of ketones to alcohols. Wait, no, both are used for ketone reductions. Oh wait, no, wait. BH3 is typically a milder reagent and is used in the formation of alcohols from ketones, but I think it's often used in a specific way, like maybe in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, maybe it can do more reductions, like esters to alcohols, whereas BH3 might not.

Wait the products given are ketones. Wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone, right? So if the product is a ketone, then the starting material must have been an ester or a carbonyl group that would result in a ketone upon reduction. Wait, no, wait. If you have a ketone
