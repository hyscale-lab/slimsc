Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. So that's a clue about the functional group present. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break down what each of those signals means.

First, the aromatic-H: two signals. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents are in a position that causes the ring protons to split into two groups. Wait, wait, di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. Let me think: if the substituents are para, the aromatic H would have two sets of equivalent Hs. Maybe two doublets? Or perhaps a triplet and a quartet? Hmm, but the NMR says two signals for aromatic H. Oh, right, in para substitution, there are two equivalent pairs of H. So each pair has their own signal, leading to two signals total. So that makes sense.

Next, the vinyl-H: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or maybe an ester group. Wait, the ester group has a carbonyl next to an oxygen, but maybe the vinyl protons are from a substituent attached to the ring. Like, perhaps an ester group with a vinyl group attached?

Wait, no, the ester group itself doesn't have vinyl H. Let me think again. So, if the substituents on the benzene ring are ester groups or something else. Wait, the FTIR shows an ester group, so that's probably one substituent. But wait, it's a di-substituted ring, so maybe one substituent is an ester group, and another substituent is something else, like a vinyl group? Or maybe the substituents are connected in a way that includes a vinyl group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituents are such that one is an ester group (like O-CO-O something) and the other substituent is a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a substituent that's a vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

The NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, while a doublet of quartets (that's a quartet split into a doublet? Or wait, maybe it's a quartet that's split into a doublet. Hmm, quartet of doublets? Or perhaps a doublet of quartets. Either way, that's more complex. Maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester structure. Wait, esters typically have structures like R-O-CO-R'. So if one of the substituents is an ester group, perhaps as an aryl ester or maybe an alkoxy ester.

Wait, but the ester group's structure might not have vinyl protons. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that one is an ester and the other is a vinyl group, like a CH2=CH-O- group or something. Or maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like an allyl ester.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent itself is a vinyl group attached to the aromatic ring. So, the di-substituted benzene has groups like -COOCH2CH2 or something else. Wait, no, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like -COOR) and another is a vinyl group (like -CH2CH2- but that's a single bond. Or a substituent that has a double bond, like a styryl group, which is a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the NMR signals. So, six signals in total. Let's categorize them:

- 2 aromatic H signals
- 2 vinyl H signals (1 doublet, 1 doublet of quartets)
- 2 CH3 groups (so two singlets because CH3 is usually a singlet unless near something that splits it, but in this case, the problem says two signals for CH3, so perhaps two different CH3 groups.)

Wait, but the problem says: two signals corresponding to â€“CH3 groups. So, two separate CH3 groups, each showing up as a separate signal. So, maybe each CH3 is in a different environment, perhaps attached to different parts of the molecule.

Wait, but if the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group, like maybe an ester substituent and another substituent that's a vinyl group attached to the ring. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is an ester group and a vinyl group attached via the ring. Or maybe the substituent is a group like an acetate attached to a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group that is part of a vinyl structure. Like, for example, if the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COO... No, wait, that's not right. Maybe it's an allyl ester, where the ester is attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, let's consider the molecular formula options. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

We need to figure out the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So for each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. So C=11, H=14. Degree of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2 =5. So 5 degrees: one from each benzene ring (3 double bonds or 1 ring + 2 double bonds?), but wait wait, a benzene ring has three double bonds but is considered as three degrees of unsaturation. Wait, actually, each ring or double bond is one degree. So a benzene ring contributes 4 degrees (since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds?), no, wait, each ring or double bond is a single degree. So benzene (three double bonds) is three degrees. So, if the molecule has a benzene ring, that's three degrees. Then, any other rings or double bonds contribute to the remaining.

So for option A: 5 degrees. Benzene is 3, so two more. Perhaps an ester group (which has a double bond in the carbonyl) and another double bond somewhere else, like a vinyl group.

Option B: C12H14O2. So C=12, H=14. DoU = (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6. So 6 degrees. Benzene (3), ester carbonyl (1), and maybe another double bond (like a vinyl group) and another ring? Or maybe a double bond elsewhere.

Option C: C12H12O2. DoU = (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7. 7 degrees. Benzene (3), ester (1), and then 3 more. Maybe that's too much.

Option D: C11H12O2. DoU=(2*11+2 -12)/2=(24-12)/2=6. 6 degrees. Benzene (3), ester (1), so two more, perhaps a double bond (vinyl) and maybe a ring.

But then, in the NMR, we have vinyl H's. So the molecule must have a double bond, like a vinyl group.

So the structure probably includes a benzene ring with two substituents: one an ester group and another a vinyl group. Or, perhaps, the substituent is an ester that includes a vinyl group, like an allyl ester.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a group like a vinyl ester, such as -COOCH2CH2CH2- but that's a single bond. Or perhaps it's an ester with a vinyl group attached, like -CO-O-CH2CH2-. No, that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is something like -CH2CH2COO- as
