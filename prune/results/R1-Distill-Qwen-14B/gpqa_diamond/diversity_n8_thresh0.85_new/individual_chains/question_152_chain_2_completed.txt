Okay, so I've got this question about quorum-sensing peptides and their effects on yeast. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that a new quorum-sensing peptide was found in Lactobacillus acidophilus. Quorum sensing is a system bacteria use to regulate gene expression based on their population density. So, when they sense they're in a large enough group, they change their behavior. Now, they treated yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with this peptide and observed the formation of a shmoo. I remember that the shmoo is a structure in yeast that's associated with the response to mating pheromones. It's like a projection that the yeast cell makes when it's trying to mate. So, the peptide is acting like a pheromone in this case, triggering the same response.

Now, the main goal is to find out about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo. They're using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. So, they're looking for proteins that are part of the chromatin that's active in the shmoo cells.

The question asks which complex's proteins will be least observed in the assay, meaning which complex is least likely to be present. The options are A to D. Let me think about each.

Option A: Nucleosome histone complex. The nucleosome is the basic unit of chromatin, made up of histone proteins around which DNA is wrapped. Since chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) captures DNA associated with proteins, the nucleosome histone complex should definitely be present. So, this complex's proteins would be abundant in the assay, so it's not the correct answer.

Option B: Pre-replication complex. This complex is involved in DNA replication. It assembles on origins of replication in the G1 phase to prepare for the initiation of replication. So, if the cells are in a particular phase, this complex would be active. But the question is about the active chromatin in the shmoo. I'm not sure how directly the pre-replication complex ties into the shmoo formation. Maybe the shmoo involves mating, which might influence cell cycle progression, but I'm not sure if this complex would be the least present.

Option C: Pre-initiation complex. This complex is related to the initiation of transcription. It includes RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors that are necessary to start transcription. Since the shmoo involves changes in gene expression, the pre-initiation complex would be active. So, these proteins should be present, making this probably not the correct answer.

Option D: Enhancer protein complex. Enhancers are regions of DNA that help increase the transcription of genes. Proteins that bind to enhancers, like certain transcription factors, would be part of this complex. If the active chromatin in the shmoo involves genes regulated by enhancers, these proteins would be present. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe enhancers are part of the DNA regions that are more open, which would be part of active chromatin. So, I'm not sure if this is the least present.

Wait, the question is about which complex's proteins are least observed. So perhaps the pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which happens during the cell cycle, but the shmoo formation might not be directly tied to replication, unless the cells are preparing to divide or something. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the question is about active chromatin. Enhancers are active regions, so their proteins would be present. The pre-initiation complex is definitely part of active transcription, so it would be present. The nucleosome complex is always part of chromatin, so it's present.

Wait, but the pre-replication complex is involved in replication, which happens in S phase. The pre-initiation complex is involved in transcription initiation, which is more about RNA synthesis. The question is about the active chromatin in the shmoo. Shmoo formation is part of the mating response, which involves the activation of specific genes. So, perhaps the enhancer proteins are part of that, and the pre-initiation complex as well.

Wait, what about the pre-replication complex? If the yeast cells are in the G1 phase, the pre-replication complex is present and active. If the treatment causes them to enter a different phase, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, does the shmoo formation influence the cell cycle? I think that when yeast cells are in the shmoo stage, they might be preparing for conjugation, which might involve cell cycle regulation, perhaps pausing the cell cycle. If the cell cycle is paused, maybe the pre-replication complex isn't active. Or maybe the cells are in a phase where replication hasn't started yet, so the pre-replication complex would be present.

Alternatively, maybe the pre-replication complex is not directly involved in the chromatin changes associated with the shmoo. The question is about the active chromatin in the shmoo. Active chromatin is typically associated with transcription, so the pre-initiation complex and enhancer proteins would be part of that. The nucleosome is always there. The pre-replication complex is more about replication, which is a different process.

So, which of these would be least observed. If the assay is about active chromatin, the pre-replication complex might not be part of it, because replication isn't necessarily active when the cell is forming a shmoo. Unless the treatment induces replication, but I don't think shmoos are directly linked to replication.

So, the least observed would be the pre-replication complex. So the correct answer would be B.


The question involves identifying which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the proteome of active chromatin in yeast cells forming a shmoo after treatment with a quorum-sensing peptide. The shmoo is associated with the mating response, which involves changes in gene expression. The analysis of the options is as follows:

- **Option A: Nucleosome histone complex**  
  The nucleosome histone complex is a fundamental component of chromatin and is always present in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Therefore, its proteins are expected to be abundant and not the least observed.

- **Option B: Pre-replication complex**  
  The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication and assembles at replication origins during the G1 phase. While cell cycle regulation might be influenced by shmoo formation, the shmoo primarily involves transcriptional changes related to mating, not replication. Thus, the pre-replication complex is less likely to be associated with the active chromatin in the shmoo.

- **Option C: Pre-initiation complex**  
  The pre-initiation complex is directly involved in transcription initiation and includes RNA polymerase II and transcription factors. Since the shmoo formation involves transcriptional activation of mating-related genes, this complex is expected to be present in active chromatin.

- **Option D: Enhancer protein complex**  
  Enhancers are DNA regions that regulate transcription, and their associated proteins are part of active chromatin. As the shmoo involves transcriptional changes, these proteins are likely to be present.

Given the focus on active chromatin in the shmoo, the pre-replication complex, which is primarily associated with DNA replication rather than transcription, is the least likely to be observed in the assay.

Answer: B
