Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, right, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but here it's talking about a Li nucleus with 3 neutrons.

Wait, so first I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it's Li-6, that would mean 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Because Li typically has isotopes—Li-6 and Li-7 are common. So in this case, X is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic speeds, so I think I'll need to use the relativistic equations for energy. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So the speed is given as 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma for that speed. v = 0.96c, so v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me get that more accurately. 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈3.57142857. Yeah, that's about 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m*c². But I need to find m, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Hmm, how do I find the mass of Li-6? Wait, the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons, right? But wait, for a nucleus like Li-6, which is an ion, but when considering as a nucleus in the collider, we're talking about it as a bare nucleus, I think. So, it's 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and probably no electrons because it's a nucleus. Wait, no, wait. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the number of electrons in a neutral Li atom is 3, but in the nucleus, the electrons are separate. But since the problem says it's a nucleus, I think we just consider protons and neutrons.

Wait, but when calculating the mass of the nucleus, it's the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the mass of the electrons, but wait, for a nucleus, it's protons plus neutrons, right? Because the electrons are in the atom, not the nucleus.

Wait, let me think. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But for a rough calculation, perhaps we can approximate it as the sum of the individual masses.

Wait, but I think I should use the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass is simply the mass of the Li-6 atom, but since it's a nucleus, maybe we have to subtract the mass of the electrons. Wait, but a Li atom has 3 electrons, each with mass about 0.00054858 amu or something.

Wait, maybe I should use the molar mass approach. The mass of one Li-6 nucleus is approximately the atomic mass. Wait, the atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but since Li-6 is an isotope, it's 6 g/mol approximately.

Wait, but to get the exact mass, perhaps I should look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it using the known masses of protons and neutrons.

Wait, let's think. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and a neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused with units. Let me clarify: the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², which is 0.938272 GeV/c². Similarly, a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c², which is 0.939565 GeV/c².

So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total mass would be 3*(0.938272 + 0.939565) GeV/c²? Wait, no, because for each proton and neutron, their rest masses. So 3 protons: 3 * 0.938272 = 2.814816 GeV/c². 3 neutrons: 3 * 0.939565 = 2.818695 GeV/c². Adding together, 2.814816 + 2.818695 = 5.633511 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait, that's the sum of the individual masses. But the actual mass of the nucleus is less due to the mass defect (binding energy). So I need to subtract the mass equivalent of the binding energy. But I'm not sure how much that is for Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think. The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but since the isotope Li-6 is about 7.59% abundant, and Li-7 is about 92.41%. So the average atomic mass is closer to 7 g/mol, but for Li-6, the exact mass would be approximately 6.015 g/mol.

Wait, wait, I should look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think. Oh, I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (amu).

So 1 amu is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.015 amu * 0.9315 GeV/c²/amu.

Calculating that: 6.015 * 0.9315 ≈ let's compute it.

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589, 0.015 * 0.9315 = approximately 0.01397. So total is about 5.60297 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is 6.015 amu. So 6.015 * 0.9315 = ?

Calculating:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589

0.015 * 0.9315 = 0.0139725

Adding: 5.589 + 0.0139725 = 5.60297
