Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because titration and pH calculations can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

Okay, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I'll outline what I know. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with NaOH (a strong base), they react in a 1:1 mole ratio. The reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Let me start by figuring out the initial concentration after dilution. When we mix equal volumes, the concentration should halve. So, the initial concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) after dilution would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid would be volume * concentration. Moles = 20 cm³ * 0.05 M = 1 mmol (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol). Then when diluted to 40 cm³, the new concentration is 1 mmol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, how much volume is needed to reach 25% titration and equivalence point?

Wait, 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, first, I need to find the total number of moles of acetic acid present. Which is 1 mmol (from before). So, at 25% titration, 0.25 mmol of acetic acid has reacted.

Wait, the moles of NaOH added at 25% would be equal to the moles of acetic acid reacted, since it's a 1:1 ratio. So, moles of NaOH = 0.25 mmol.

But wait, let me think. The total moles of acetic acid is 1 mmol. So, 25% of that is 0.25 mmol. So, 0.25 mmol of NaOH is added, which neutralizes 0.25 mmol of acetic acid, producing 0.25 mmol of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

So, the solution after 25% titration will have some acetic acid left and some acetate ions. It's a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, I need to calculate the concentrations of HA and A^- in the solution.

Wait, the total volume at 25% titration? Hmm, when we add NaOH, the volume changes. Let me think: the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, when titrating, how much NaOH is added at 25%? Let's compute that.

Moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point: since we have 1 mmol of acetic acid, the equivalence point is at 1 mmol of NaOH. So, the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. That's 1 mmol / 0.1 M = 10 cm³.

So, at 25% titration, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So the total solution volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³.

Wait, but wait, during the titration, the NaOH is being added to the acetic acid solution, so the volume increases. So, the total volume at 25% is 40 cm³ (initial) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH) = 42.5 cm³.

Now, the moles of CH3COOH left: initial 1 mmol - 0.25 mmol (reacted) = 0.75 mmol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.25 mmol.

So, the concentrations in the 42.5 cm³ solution would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.75 mmol / 42.5 cm³ = 0
