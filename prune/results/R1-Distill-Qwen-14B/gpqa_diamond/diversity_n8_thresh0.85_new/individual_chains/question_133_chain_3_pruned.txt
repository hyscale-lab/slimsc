Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I think I can work through it.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. We have two substances added to the solution: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are phosphoric acid derivatives, so they should relate to the different forms of phosphate ions.

First, I remember that phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The dissociation steps are:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Orthophosphate ions, I think, are HPO4^2- or maybe H2PO4^-? Wait, orthophosphate is usually H3PO4, but when it dissociates, the different ions are formed. Oh wait, no, the term "orthophosphate" refers to the H3PO4 molecule itself. But in solution, it dissociates into H2PO4^- and so on. So when the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, I need to clarify what that means. Or wait, maybe orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? Or perhaps it's H2PO4^-? Hmm, I should double-check that.

Wait, I think orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is the fully deprotonated form, but that's the least likely to be in solution because it's the strongest base. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the HPO4^2- ion as orthophosphate. Or perhaps the term is being used differently here. Hmm, maybe the question is using "orthophosphate" to mean the HPO4^2- ion. Alternatively, I've heard that orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the ions would be H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, the problem states "orthophosphate ions" in the solution. So maybe it's referring to HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are sodium and potassium salts of phosphate. So, when they dissolve, they will contribute to the concentration of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution.

Wait, let me think about the salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (I think NaHPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, but wait, Na2HPO4 would be disodium hydrogen phosphate. So when it dissolves, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the solution has a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, these can interconvert based on the acid dissociation constants.

The problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then we're looking for [HPO4^2-]. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to H2PO4^- as the orthophosphate ion. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this.

Wait, the user might have a specific definition in mind. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total concentration of phosphate species, but I think that's not the case. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". Ortho usually refers to the less protonated form. Wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (the orthophosphate ion). So maybe the question is asking for [H2PO4^-].

But wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, can these ions react with each other? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

But in this case, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present. So, maybe the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then that's the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the ortho phosphate is H2PO4^-.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the terminology. Maybe I should proceed with the calculations and see what comes out.

So, first, let's find the moles of each substance.

The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 liters.

KH2PO4 has a mass of 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a mass of 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol.

So, when these dissociate:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^- → 0.007343 mol H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- → 0.005612 mol HPO4^2-.

So, the total solution has 0.007343 moles of H2PO4^- and 0.005612 moles of HPO4^2- in 0.2 L.

But wait, these ions can interconvert. The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^
