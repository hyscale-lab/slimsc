Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let's see.

The question says: two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, because you can't just add or subtract velocities like in classical mechanics. Right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, which way around? So, if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, then from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) multiplied by something? Or wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, the formula is (u' - v')/(1 - (u'v')/c²), where u' is the velocity of one object in the other's frame. Actually, maybe I should think of it as: if in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then what is the relative speed of B from A's perspective?

Wait no, the problem says they are both moving in the positive x-direction. So, from A's frame, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u v / c²)), but wait, no. Wait, wait, the correct formula is (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or is it (u - v) divided by that denominator?

Wait, no, correct formula for relative velocity: If object 1 is moving at u in the lab frame, and object 2 is moving at v in the lab frame, then from object 1's frame, the velocity of object 2 is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So here, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is (0.5 - 0.6) c = (-0.1 c). The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1 c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857 c. But since speed is a positive quantity, it's 0.142857 c. Approximately 0.143c. Looking at the options, I see options C and D have 0.14c as relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, wait, the system's energy should be the sum of the energies of each astronaut, right? Because energy is conserved and each contributes their own relativistic energy.

Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m
