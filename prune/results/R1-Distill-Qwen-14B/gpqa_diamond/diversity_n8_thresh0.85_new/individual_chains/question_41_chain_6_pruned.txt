Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the question is about the speed of light in a glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, so the setup is that a light beam is moving through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. The speed of light in the glass is given by c divided by n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by v, where v is the speed of light in the medium. So normally, without any movement, the speed would be 1/n since c is given as 1 here. But here, the glass is moving, so I think I need to consider the relative velocities.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The light is propagating through the glass, so the medium itself is moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

I remember from special relativity that velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, the light is inside the moving glass. So the light's speed in the glass's frame is 1/n. But we need to find the speed in the lab frame where the glass is moving at velocity v.

Wait, so the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n (since it's inside the glass). But from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, how does the light's speed change?

Wait, no. Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, so the lab frame is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light is inside the moving medium. So we need to apply the velocity transformation.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about it in terms of the Doppler effect or relativistic velocity addition. Let me think.

In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab sees the speed of light as the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame, corrected by the relativistic addition formula.

So the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ). Wait, but here, u
