Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says we have a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems. Each system has a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. 

From the theoretical modeling, the wave function of each particle in the region where it can exist is described by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5*i. Wait, I think I should write that down correctly. So the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, right? So having an imaginary part makes sense.

When they measure the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. That means the wave function must be zero outside the region x=1 to x=3. Oh, but wait, the wave function given is only for the part where the particle exists. So, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Wait, but how do I find 'a'? I remember that the wave function must be normalized. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because that's the condition for normalization.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, the absolute square would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ].

Because for a complex number z = a + ib, |z|² = a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = [ (a²)/(1 + x) ) + (0.25) ].

The integral of this from 1 to 3 must equal 1. So:

Integral [ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me break this integral into two parts:

Integral (a²)/(1 + x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ 1/(1 + x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1 + x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Now, subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²:

a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Take square root to find a:

a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485. Hmm, that's approximately 0.8485, which is around 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistake in the integration?

The first integral: (a²)
