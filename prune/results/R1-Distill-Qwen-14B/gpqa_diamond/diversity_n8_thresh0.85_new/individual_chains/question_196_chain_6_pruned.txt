Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so relativity must come into play somehow. Oh right, in relativity, when speeds get close to the speed of light, special relativity effects become important, like time dilation and mass increase.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's think through this step by step.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found by considering energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², and all of that converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So, (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = sqrt(kA²/m). Wait, that's option C. But this is the non-relativistic case.

But since the problem says "relativistic," that approach might not hold because the speed can't exceed the speed of light, and relativistic effects must be considered. So the classical formula will be modified.

In relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). But how does that tie into the oscillator's energy?

The system's total energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy, right? Or wait, maybe it's the sum of rest energy and the oscillatory energy. Hmm, perhaps in this case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but when considering relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, maybe the total energy in the relativistic case comes from the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So at the maximum displacement A, the mass is at rest in the classical sense (but not really, because it's about to start moving), so all the energy is potential. Then, as it moves, this potential energy converts into relativistic kinetic energy.

So at x = A, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA². Then, at x=0, all that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy in relativity is E_k = (gamma - 1) mc².

So let's set up the energy conservation equation. The total energy when the mass is at x=A is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy: E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point x=0, all that energy goes into relativistic kinetic energy: E_total = (gamma) mc².

Wait, that's correct because when x=0, the potential energy is zero (since U = (1/2)k x²), and the total energy is just the kinetic energy plus rest energy. Wait, no. Or maybe the total energy at x=A is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, because the oscillator's potential is (1/2)kx². So:

At x=A:
E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So E_total is mc² + (gamma - 1) mc² = gamma mc².

So equate both expressions:

mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

Rearranging, (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Then, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, K. So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + K.

Hmm, solving for v. Let's square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + K)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + K)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + K)^2.

Compute 1 - [1/(1 + K)^2]:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + K)^2 ].

But K is (k A²)/(2 m c^2), so:

v_max² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ]

Take square root:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Which option matches this? Let's look at the options.

Option D says: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 +kA²/(2 m c²))² )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the answer should be D.

Wait a second, let me double-check the steps. I considered that the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when at x=0, the total energy is gamma mc². So, the equation comes out correctly.

Alternatively, if the setup is different, like perhaps the potential energy isn't (1/2)k x² in this relativistic case? Hmm, I'm not sure. But the problem states that it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy should be the same, (1/2)k x². So my approach seems right.

Looking at the other options:

Option A has a different denominator, 1 - (kA²)/(2m), which doesn't have the c² in the denominator. That looks non-relativistic, but perhaps in the denominator.

Option B: it's sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ...)), but in our case, we have 1 - ... so that doesn't match.

Option C is the non-relativistic result, so it's not the correct answer here.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider relativistic energy conservation. 

In the relativistic case, the total energy of the system at maximum displacement \( x = A \) is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy, which is given by:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for total energy:

\[
mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \gamma mc^2.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: The denominator lacks \( c^2 \), making it non-relativistic.
- **Option B**: The expression inside the square root has the wrong sign, which does not match the derived result.
- **Option C**: This is the classical (non-relativistic) result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
