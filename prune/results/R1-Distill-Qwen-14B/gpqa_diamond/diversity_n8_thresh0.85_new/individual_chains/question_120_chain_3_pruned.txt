Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their spatial density is the same throughout space. So, the number of stars doesn't depend on how far you look, but maybe the way we observe them does.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth over the course of a year. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So, if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's say we have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are in that range? Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of space we're looking at.

In three dimensions, the volume of a sphere increases with the cube of the radius. So, as distance increases, the volume (and hence the number of stars in that volume, assuming uniform distribution) would go up. But wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, let me think in terms of parallax.

If I consider a thin shell of stars at a distance corresponding to a parallax plx, what's the volume of that shell? The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. Since r is the distance, and plx is 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So, the volume becomes 4π(1/plx)^2 * dr. Oh wait, wait, dr is in distance units. If I'm considering a change in parallax dplx, then I need to relate dr to dplx.

Let's express dr in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/r, taking the derivative, dplx = -1/r² dr. So, dr = -r² dplx. Hmm, but since r is positive, and dplx is a small change in parallax, maybe I can drop the negative sign because we're considering magnitude. So, dr ≈ (1/plx)^2 * dplx.

Putting that back into the volume: 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² dplx) )= 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr, correct. And since r = 1/plx, substituting that in gives 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. Now, dr is in terms of the change in r. How do I express dr in terms of dplx?

We have plx = 1/r, so differentiating both sides: dplx = - (1/r²) dr. Solving for dr gives dr = - r² dplx. Since r is 1/plx, r² is 1/plx². So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since dplx is a small positive change (
