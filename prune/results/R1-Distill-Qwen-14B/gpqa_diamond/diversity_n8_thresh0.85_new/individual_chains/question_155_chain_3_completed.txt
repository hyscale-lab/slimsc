Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Wait, so I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like ΔP_z, is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to find these expectation values.

The system is in the state given by the column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me call this state |ψ>. So first, I need to compute <P_z>, which is the expectation value of P_z. That's ψ† P_z ψ. 

Looking at the matrix for P_z, it's diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So, the matrix is:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

The state vector ψ has components (a, b, c) = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). 

So to compute <P_z>, I can just take the dot product of ψ with P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, it's easy. Each component is multiplied by the diagonal element and summed.

So,
< P_z > = ħ*(a)^2 + 0*(b)^2 + (-ħ)*(c)^2
= ħ*( (-1/2)^2 ) + 0 + (-ħ)*( (-1/2)^2 )
= ħ*(1/4) - ħ*(1/4)
= 0

Oh, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero. That might simplify things.

Now, I need to find <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z squared is:
[ (ħ)^2  0      0    ]
[ 0      0      0    ]
[ 0      0     (-ħ)^2 ]

So <P_z²> is computed as:
= (ħ²)*(a)^2 + 0*(b)^2 + (ħ²)*(c)^2
= ħ²*( (1/4) + (1/4) )
Wait, because a is -1/2, so squared is 1/4, same for c. So:
= ħ²*(1/4 + 1/4) = ħ²*(1/2) = ħ²/2.

Wait, so <P_z²> is (ħ²)( ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) ) since the middle term is zero. So yes, that's 2*(1/4) = 1/2.

So now, putting it into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 )
= sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 )
= sqrt( ħ²/2 )
= ħ / sqrt(2)

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Did I compute everything correctly?

Let me go through <P_z> again. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So when I multiply P_z by this vector, it's [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/sqrt(2)), -ħ*(-1/2) ] = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]. Then ψ† times that is (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(ħ/2). 

Which is (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Yep, that's correct.

For <P_z²>, the state vector is multiplied by P_z squared. So each component is squared and multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element. So a² is (1/4), c² is (1/4). So it's ħ²*(1/4) + 0 + ħ²*(1/4) = (ħ²/4 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector $\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$. The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \hbar \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + (-\hbar) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 + (-\hbar) \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is obtained by squaring the diagonal elements of $P_z$, resulting in:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \hbar^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \hbar^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 + \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
