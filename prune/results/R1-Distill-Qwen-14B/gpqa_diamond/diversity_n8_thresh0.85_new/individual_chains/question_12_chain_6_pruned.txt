Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given as Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A, B, C, D with different values.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny masses, right? Or wait, in this case, since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with certain energies.

So, the process is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since Pi+ is at rest, the total initial energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The products are a muon and a neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is nearly massless, so I can probably ignore its rest mass.

In particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their energies and momenta are determined by conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the total momentum after must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

So, let's denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p (since they go in opposite directions). 

The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, energy of muon E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, actually E_mu is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / m_mu c²? Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. So, E = sqrt(p² + m²) in MeV units, perhaps.

Wait, units can get a bit confusing. Let me think of energy in MeV, mass in MeV/c², and momentum in MeV/c.

So, the total energy of the system after decay must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_nu^2 ). Since the neutrino's mass is negligible (m_nu ≈ 0), E_nu ≈ p. Because sqrt(p² + 0) = p. So E_nu ≈ p.

So, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ), and E_nu = p.

So, putting it together: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

That's one equation, and we have to solve for p.

Let me set x = p. So equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² + 105.7^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides: x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So, left side: x² + 11172.49 (since 105.7^2 is about 105.7 * 105.7, let me compute that: 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140, so 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49). So left side is x² + 11172.49.

Right side: (139.6)^2 is (approx) 139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute that: 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. So (139.6)^2 ≈ 19488.16. So right side is 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x².

So putting it all together:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides: 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Now, subtract 19488.16 from both sides: 11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 x.

Calculate 11172.49 - 19488.16: that's negative 8315.67.

So, -8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2: x = (-8315.67)/(-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2:

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315. So 29.8 perhaps?

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Well, 279.2 *30=8376, so 279.2 * 29.8 = 8376 - (279.2 * 0.2) = 8376 - 55.84= 8320.16.

But 8315.67 is a bit less than 8320.16, so perhaps x is about 29.8 - (4.49)/(279.2), which is approx 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So, the neutrino's energy E_nu is x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(x² + (1
