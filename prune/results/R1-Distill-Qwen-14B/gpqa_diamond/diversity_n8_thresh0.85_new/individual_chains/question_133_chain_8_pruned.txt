Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions... Phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But I think phosphate can also be HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- or even H3PO4. Oh wait, but orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

So, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution. Let me think about the components in the solution. 

We have KH2PO4, which is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other compound is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the main species are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). Now, phosphate can act as an acid and a base because it's a weak acid. So in solution, these two forms can interconvert. 

But wait, what's the pH of the solution? Because the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the pH. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, the pH will determine the dominant form.

I remember that the pH depends on the pKa values. The H3PO4 has three dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (pKa1 = ~2.12)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (pKa2 = ~7.21)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (pKa3 = ~12.32)

Wait, because Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 is log(1/(7.5e-3)) ≈ 2.12. Similarly, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 is about 7.21, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is around 12.32.

So in this solution, we have H2PO4
