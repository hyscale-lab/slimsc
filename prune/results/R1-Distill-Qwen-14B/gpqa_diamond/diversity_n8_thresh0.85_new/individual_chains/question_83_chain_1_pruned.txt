Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says: We dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, let's outline the steps I think I need to do:

1. Calculate the initial concentration after dilution.
2. Determine the equivalence point volume.
3. For 25% titration, find out how much NaOH has been added and calculate the pH based on the buffer solution.
4. At equivalence point, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion and find the pH from that.

Starting with the first step: Diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water.

Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, V2 is the total volume after dilution, which is 20 + 20 = 40 cm³.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 *20 = 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid initially = M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V → V = moles / M.

So V = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks about 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. Because 25% titration usually means 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence.

So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, how many moles of NaOH have been added at 25% titration?

Moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L (since 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L) = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So when we add 0.00025 mol of NaOH, it will react with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to form acetate.

So the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH left = initial - reacted = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed = 0.00025 mol.

But the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial 40 cm³ (from the dilution) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Wait, wait, no. Because when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution to the 40 cm³ solution, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = (7.5e-4)/(4.25e-2) = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, 0.00025 mol is 2.5e-4, divided by 0.0425 L (42.5 cm³), so 2.5e-4 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.732 (since log(1e-5) is 5; 1.85 is about 0.268, so 5 - 0.268 ≈ 4.732).

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute pKa correctly. pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = let's calculate it.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that's roughly 4.26. So the pH at 25% is around 4.26.

Wait, but let's think again. Have I considered the correct volumes?

Wait, when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So my earlier calculations are correct.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26. Now, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So reaction consumes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate. So remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 mol, acetate is 0.00025.

Total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, so 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → 4.73 + (-0.477) → 4.253.

So approximately 4.25, which rounds to 4.25. Option A has 4.26, which is close. So option A's first value is 4.26, which seems correct.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

So the moles of NaOH added are 10 cm³, as calculated. The total solution volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since all the acid has reacted), so concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction can be approximated with:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, and x is small compared to 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 5.517 → pOH is 5.517, so pH is 14 - 5.517 ≈ 8.483.

Wait, but I thought the equivalence point in a weak acid-strong base titration is basic because the salt is the conjugate base.

But wait, the calculated pH here is around 8.48. Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. So if the pH at equivalence is around 8.48, then the closest option is A: 4.26; 8.52.

But
