Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. Okay, so it's about organic chemistry reactions and their corresponding spectroscopic data. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question begins with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR and IR data are provided. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Let me start by figuring out what each product is.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (di-bromides) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, leading to the formation of alkenes. So product 1 is probably the elimination product, which is 1,3-adamantene or something similar. Wait, more accurately, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules upon elimination to form 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe a bridge structure? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the structure of the product here. Alternatively, since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, maybe the elimination forms an alkene in the structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons (since it's 1,3; but wait, adamantane is a polycyclic compound with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons. So heating with KOH would deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diene adamantane?

Wait, no, the elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a conjugated diene. Because each elimination (E2) removes one HBr, but since there are two Brs, two eliminations happen. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene substituted adamantane.

But looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), that's
