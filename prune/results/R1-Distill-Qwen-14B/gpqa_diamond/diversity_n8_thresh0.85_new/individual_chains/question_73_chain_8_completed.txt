Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when considering relative speed in relativity, I can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because at high speeds, the effects of relativity become significant. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)). Right, so plugging in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c. Let me calculate that. 

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) 

Simplify numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, that would match either option C or D for the relative speed part.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but wait, no—that's not quite right. In relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given by gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. So for each astronaut, we calculate their gamma factor and multiply by mc², then add them together.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that for each.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c. v²/c² = 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. Sqrt is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

Now, their energies. First astronaut's rest mass is 2m. So energy E1 = gamma * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut's rest mass is 3m. E2 = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Rounding this, it's about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c which matches our calculations. So the correct choice is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to find the relative speed between the two astronauts moving in the same direction:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]
Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
