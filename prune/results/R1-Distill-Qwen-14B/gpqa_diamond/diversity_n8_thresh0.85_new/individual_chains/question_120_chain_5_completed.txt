Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, parallax makes me think of how stars appear to move relative to each other as the Earth orbits the Sun. Oh right, the parallax angle is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. That probably means that their spatial density is uniform. So the number of stars in a certain region doesn't depend on how far away that region is. But how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if distance d increases, plx decreases. Now, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx.

Wait, number per unit plx range. So, maybe I should think about the differential number of stars in a range of plx. Let's think about it. Suppose I have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is 4πd² dd. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, let me substitute d in terms of plx. Then, the number of stars in a shell at plx would be n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But since d = 1/plx, dd = -d^2 d plx (Wait, maybe I should express dd in terms of d plx. Let me think. If d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx. So, substituting, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 d plx). But wait, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're looking for the magnitude here, I can drop the negative sign.

So putting it together, number of stars per unit plx range (d plx) is n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) )? Wait, that would make 1/plx^4. But that doesn't seem right because I think I'm mixing the units.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider the number of stars in a range of parallax from plx to plx + d plx. The corresponding distances would be from d to d + dd, where d = 1/plx, so dd is the change in distance for a small change in plx.

The number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But plx p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 dd. And I need to express this in terms of plx.

So N = n *4π (1/p^2) * dd.

But I should express dd in terms of d plx. Because I'm looking for the number per unit plx. So plx p is 1/d, so d p = -1/d^2 dd. So, dd = -d^2 d p. The negative just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe we can ignore it.

So, dd = (1/p^2) d p. Because d =1/p, so d^2 = 1/p^2.

Putting this into the expression for N:

N = n *4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) d p.

So N = n *4π (1/p^4) d p.

Wait, that gives the number of stars per unit plx (d p) as proportional to 1/p^4. But that would mean the number of stars per unit plx (i.e., the number in each small plx interval) decreases as p^4. So the number per unit plx is 1/p^4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So is that the answer?

Wait, but another approach: think about the number of stars in a certain range of distances. If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d^2 dd. Because the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd, and n is constant.

But because parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So, substituting, the number of stars in terms of p is proportional to (1/p)^2 * (dd). But since dd = (1/p^2) dp (from p = 1/d), then the number is proportional to (1/p^2) * (1/p^2 dp) )= 1/p^4 dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but let me think about it again. The number per unit parallax interval (dp) is N = n *4π d^2 * (dd). But since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p^2) dp. So, N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2 dp) ) = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars \( n \) is constant.

Consider a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), and the number of stars in this shell is proportional to \( n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since \( d = 1/p \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( dp \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the expression for the number of stars, we get:

\[
N \propto n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right).
\]

Simplifying, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) becomes:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( p^{-4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/plx^4**
