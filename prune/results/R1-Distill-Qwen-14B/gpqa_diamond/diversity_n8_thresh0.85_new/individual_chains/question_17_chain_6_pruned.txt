Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions. The problem gives the formation constant, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or anything.

Wait, I remember that when EDTA complexes with a metal ion like calcium, the complex dissociates into the metal ion and the EDTA. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- , and K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

In this case, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is ideal and the complex doesn't dissociate much, I can model this. But wait, K is a very large number, 5x10^10, which means the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low.

Let me think about the setup. Let's say the concentration of the complex is C, which is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The dissociation would result in some [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-],
