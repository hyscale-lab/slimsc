Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. The question is about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So, the pion is stationary, so its momentum is zero. That means the products must have equal and opposite momenta to each other. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? So, the muon would carry most of the momentum, but I'm not sure how to calculate the kinetic energies directly.

The given data: the rest mass of the Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the mu-plus is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? Oh, neutrinos are leptons, but they have such a tiny rest mass that for many purposes, especially in these kinds of problems, their rest mass is considered negligible. So I'll treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation.

So, the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. That makes sense.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).

So, setting up the energy equation:
E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino
139.6 MeV = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu

And for momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest:
p_muon = p_neutrino (in magnitude, opposite in direction)

But for a relativistic particle, energy and momentum are related by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since we're working in units where c=1 (as in MeV and MeV/c²), this simplifies to E² = p² + m².

So for the muon:
E_muon² = p² + (105.7)²

And for the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu * c. But again, with c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

Since the pion is at rest, p_muon = p_nu. So let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, which is equal to the neutrino's momentum.

So, E_muon = sqrt(p² + 105.7²)
E_nu = p

Now, substituting into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p

Hmm, I need to solve for p here. Let me rearrange this equation. Let me set x = p for simplicity.

So, 139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x

Subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x² + 105.7²)

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)² = x² + 105.7²

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6*x + x² = x² + 105.7²

Simplify, cancel x²:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x = 105.7²

Calculate 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6 squared: let me compute that. 140² is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Wait, but wait—wait, 139.6 is actually 140 minus 0.4, yes. So 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4². 140² is 19600. 2*140*0.4 is 1
