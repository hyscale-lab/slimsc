Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c, and we need to find the energy of RHIC. The options are given in GeV, so I'm assuming the answer will be in that unit.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical mechanics. So I'll need to use the theory of relativity here. The key concepts are gamma factor and relativistic energy.

Wait, what's the nucleus X? Oh, the problem states it's Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. But with 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = mass number 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which is a charged particle. But for calculating energy, I think I need the rest mass energy of the ion.

Wait, but in particle physics, when calculating the energy for an ion, do I consider it as a collection of protons and neutrons, or treat it as a whole? I think we can treat it as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of the individual masses. But wait, the actual mass of the nucleus is a bit different because of binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, no. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate that: 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Wait, wait, no, wait—wait, each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So maybe I should calculate each separately.

Wait, but for a nucleus, the actual mass is a bit less than the sum due to binding energy. Oh, but maybe in this problem, we can ignore that and just take the sum of the individual rest masses. Or perhaps the question expects us to use the
