Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, let's see. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, I need to think carefully.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are provided. I think the first step is to figure out how much each acid and base contribute to the reaction.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about mixing all three solutions. So I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, see how they react.

Let me break it down. First, calculate moles for each solution.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. HCl is 0.2 M in 500 mL. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is a strong acid as well. But wait, sulfuric is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+ ions. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So moles of H+ would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole gives two OH- ions. The concentration is 0.5 M in 200 mL. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. When acids and bases neutralize, the H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio: H+ + OH- → H2O. So I need to find out which one is the limiting reactant.

The total H+ from both acids is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0
