Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to produce a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, which gives product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so I remember that it's a bicyclic structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Dibrominated at the 1 and 3 positions. Heating with KOH—so probably an elimination reaction, E2 mechanism since KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with strong bases, they eliminate to form alkenes. But wait, this is 1,3-dibromo, not 1,2. So would elimination still happen?

Wait a second, maybe it's not a vicinal dihalide. Wait, 1 and 3 positions in adamantane. I'm trying to visualize the structure. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings—so the 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent bridges perhaps? Maybe when KOH is used, it leads to dehydrohalogenation (elimination of HBr twice) producing an alkene. But since there are two bromines, maybe two elimination steps happen.

Wait, wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane might have two bromines on adjacent carbons. No, actually, adamantane's structure is such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent—maybe they're on opposite ends of a bridge. So perhaps heating with KOH would lead to two elimination steps, each removing a Br and adding a double bond. But wait, let me think: each bromine is on a bridgehead carbon. So maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an allene or some kind of conjugated diene? Or maybe a bridged diene.

Wait, but the product 1's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). So product 1 is likely an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides have different IR. Or maybe a ketone. Because 1720 is around where ketones show up. So maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, when dihalides eliminate, they form alkenes. But if the base is strong and conditions are right, maybe a double elimination occurs, but how does that lead to a ketone? Oh, wait! Maybe it's dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the rings open up.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps heating with KOH leads to the formation of an epoxide. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution? But KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Adamantane has four rings. Each bridgehead is a carbon attached to three other carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bridgehead carbons each with a bromine.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would form a diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, not hydroxyl (O-H stretch is around 3200-3600 cm^-1, which isn't mentioned here). So maybe it's not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, and the two Brs are removed, leading to a double bond. But then how would that result in a carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, another reaction: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Br) undergo dehydrohalogenation, they form alkenes. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3, not 1,2. So perhaps the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure, allowing for elimination to form a double bond. But if that's the case, product 1 would be an alkene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak at 1720.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to formation of a ketone. How? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe the starting material is a dihalide, and upon treatment with KOH, it forms an epoxide via a neighboring group participation. But I'm not quite sure about that mechanism.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, losing two equivalents of
