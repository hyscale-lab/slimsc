Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the various planes and axes that leave the molecule looking the same after certain operations. The notation C3h, I think, refers to a type of symmetry involving a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, the h in C3h stands for horizontal, right? So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about each option and their structures.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, the name is a bit complicated. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. Trifuran would mean three furan rings, I think. And the numbering is a bit tricky. I'm picturing a structure with three phenyl groups attached to a central part, possibly a tricyclic system. The substitution pattern might be symmetric. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the symmetry here. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, maybe it could have a three-fold axis. But wait, the h in C3h suggests a horizontal mirror plane as well.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This one also has a benzo part, so a benzene ring. The trifuran indicates three furan rings attached. The numbering might be such that the substituents are in a symmetric pattern. I'm trying to visualize it. Maybe it's like a central tricyclic structure with benzene rings attached in a symmetrical way. But I'm not certain. Maybe benzene rings are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. So this is (i-Pr)3BO, right? The structure is a borate with three isopropyl groups attached to the boron. So the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron. Wait, each isopropyl group is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So, all three substituents are the same. So the structure should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's see: if you look along the B atom, each substituent is the same, so rotating 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. But what about a mirror plane? If the molecule is non-planar, maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the B-atom's plane. Wait, the borate ion is trigonal planar, so the molecule is flat. So, a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. So, looking at this, triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), so it should have C3h symmetry. Hmm, so option C could be the answer.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think. It has a bridge structure between two rings. The structure is a norbornane-like compound, which is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, right? So it's a cage structure with three bridgeheads. The symmetry of quinuclidine: I think it has a three-fold rotation axis. Because all the bridgeheads are equivalent. Wait, quinuclidine has a point where three bridges meet, each bridge being equivalent. So, rotating 120 degrees would bring the molecule into itself. But what about mirror planes? Quinuclidine doesn't have a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis that's a horizontal mirror. Because it's a chair-like structure, maybe. Or perhaps it's more of a flat structure? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Quinuclidine's structure is more like a cube, but perhaps in terms of symmetry, it's C3 or maybe D3h. Wait, I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and some mirror planes, but I'm not sure if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry is C3v. Hmm, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me recap. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

For option C, triisopropyl borate: all three substituents are identical, so a three-fold rotation symmetry. The molecule is flat, so there's a mirror plane perpendicular to the plane of the boron. That would make it C3h, I think. So that's a candidate.

Now, looking at option D, quinuclidine. Let's think about its structure. Quinuclidine has a structure where three bridges meet at a single point. Each bridge is a two-carbon bridge. So, the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not entirely sure. If the molecule is non-planar, then perhaps the mirror plane is not horizontal. Alternatively, maybe it's a vertical mirror plane. Let me think: the three bridges are arranged symmetrically, so any plane that goes through the central carbon and two bridge positions might act as a mirror. But I'm not certain it has a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it has a C3v symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes. That would not be C3h, which requires a horizontal mirror plane. So perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have C3h symmetry.

So between options C and A, B, D. I think option C might be the correct one. But I should double-check the other options.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached to a central tricyclic system, perhaps arranged symmetrically. If the phenyl groups are attached in a trigonal planar fashion around the central part, then yes, a three-fold axis. But what about a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is flat, then a mirror plane would exist. So maybe this also has C3h symmetry. But I'm not sure if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for the mirror plane.

Option B: benzo...trifuran. This would have a benzene ring attached in such a way that perhaps the substituents are arranged in a symmetric fashion. But with a benzene ring, which is itself a planar structure, but perhaps the overall molecule is flat. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then yes, a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry is lower.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule with three identical substituents. So the boron is at the center, and each isopropyl is at 120 degrees. So rotating 120 degrees would bring each substituent into the next position. Also, a horizontal mirror plane would exist, so any plane that's perpendicular to the plane of the boron and bisects the molecule. So that would satisfy C3h symmetry.

In that case, option C would be the correct answer. But wait, the options are A, B, C, D. The options are labeled such that option C is triisopropyl borate, and D is quinuclidine.

So, the correct answer would be option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the symmetry requirements: a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Each option is evaluated based on its structure and symmetry.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule has three phenyl groups attached to a central tricyclic system. The phenyl groups are likely arranged symmetrically, suggesting a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is unclear due to the complexity of the structure. Without explicit confirmation of a horizontal mirror plane, this option is less likely to have C₃h symmetry
