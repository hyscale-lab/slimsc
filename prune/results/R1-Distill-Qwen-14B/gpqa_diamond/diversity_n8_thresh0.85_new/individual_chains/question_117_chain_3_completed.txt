Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry isomers, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are called enantiomers. They can rotate plane-polarized light, which is why they're called optical isomers.

The question provides four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's look at each one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1. So the two benzene rings are attached at the central carbon. The substituents are nitro groups at 6,6' positions and carboxylate groups at 2,2' positions. Wait, but for biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that are symmetric, maybe the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Oh wait, but if each ring has substituents in positions that are across from each other, could that create a chiral center? Wait, no, this compound is a biphenyl derivative. The central atom is a single bond between the two rings, right? So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not symmetrical, maybe the molecule can have a chiral center. Wait, but in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, 2 and 6 are opposite positions on the benzene. But wait, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 on each ring. So the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each benzene. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a substituent at position 2 and 6. Wait, but 2 and 6 are adjacent to each other if the biphenyl is connected at position 1. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. The central bond is between two carbons, each attached to a benzene ring. Each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the substituents on both rings are in positions that are across from each other. Wait, but the rings are connected at position 1. So the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring – perhaps the arrangement leads to a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. If the arrangement is such that the substituents are not symmetrical, then the molecule might be chiral. So maybe this compound can exhibit optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. I'm not sure. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are the same, but their positions are mirrored, perhaps? Let's think: on each ring, the nitro is in the 6 position and the carboxylate in 2. So for the first ring, position 6 is on the opposite side of the central bond, and position 2 is adjacent. Similarly for the second ring. But wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that they mirror each other across the central bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that there's no symmetry, leading to chirality. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should leave this one for now and check the others.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but as an ester, it's R-O-CO-... Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be CH3-O-CO-CH2CH(OH)... Wait, no, wait, the structure is OCH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, let me think. The formula would be: the ester group is OMe (methyl ester). The acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but as an ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see the structure. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. The second carbon is connected to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

The central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon on one side) and another CH2 group? Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3 ?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me write it properly. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Looking at the central carbon (the second carbon, attached to OH and CH2COOCH3). The structure is:

CH2(OH) is on the second carbon. So the second carbon is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a -CH2COOCH3 group)
- CH3 (from the first carbon?)
Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons. The chain is:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait no, that can't be right because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOH.

When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- OH,
- a CH2 group connected to carbon 1 (CH2-),
- a CH2 group connected to carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So carbon 2 is CH(OH) connected to:

- One carbon on the left (CH2-), which is CH2- group, so that's a single bond to another CH2.
Wait, the carbon 2 is actually CH(OH) connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2- (so two H's on C1),
- Carbon 3: CH2COOCH3,
- and an OH group.

Wait, no, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no. Propanoate is three carbons: CH2-CH2-COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon (carbon 2), which is the CH(OH) group. Let's see the four substituents:

1. OH
2. CH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me correct. Carbon 2 is attached to:

- One CH2 group (on the left) leading to carbon 1 (which is a methyl group, CH3-CH(OH)-...)
Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the substituents on the central carbon. The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (one leading to carbon 1, which is CH3, and the other leading to carbon 3, which is COOCH3),
Wait, no. Wait, in the structure, carbon 2 is connected to two CH2 groups? Let's think:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Breaking it down:

Carbon 1: CH2- (attached to OH),
Carbon 2: CH2- (attached to carbon 1 and carbon 3),
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The carbons are arranged as:

CH2-OH connected to CH2, which is connected to COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the CH2 that's connected to the OH and the CH2 connected to the COOCH3.

Wait no, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH2-OH
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, carbon 2 is CH2, which is connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3. So, carbon 2 is the central carbon. Wait, let's see: The substituents on carbon 2 would be:

- Two CH2 groups? No. Wait, no, carbon 2 is CH2, so it's bonded to:

- Carbon 1: which is CH2-OH,
- Carbon 3: which is COOCH3,
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if it's CH2, then there are two H's. So the substituents on carbon 2 are:

- Two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the structure is better represented as:

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon (the second carbon, CH2), which is connected to:

- One CH2-OH group,
- One CH2-COOCH3 group,
- Two H atoms.

Wait, no. The second carbon is CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is CH2, connected to two CH2 groups and two H's. Wait, that would mean the second carbon is a CH2 group, so it can't be a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents.

Wait, but wait—no. The central carbon in this case would be the second carbon. Let's check its substituents: the groups attached would be:

- CH2OH (from the left),
- CH2COOCH3 (from the right),
- and two H's.

But that's only three different groups. Wait, no. Actually, the second carbon is:

Connected to:

1. The first carbon: which is CH2OH (so a CH2 group),
2. The third carbon: which is CH2COOCH3,
3. Two H's.

So the substituents are: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. That's only three distinct groups, so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound doesn't have a chiral center. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait—is there another possibility? Maybe the third carbon is COOCH3 connected to CH2, which is connected to CH2OH. So the second carbon's substituents are:

- CH2OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- H,
- H.

So no, that's two H's, so not four different groups. So no chiral center here. So compound 2 doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the molecule is arranged differently, like CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that would be different. Wait, the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is probably:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So for the second carbon, the substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- CH3 (from the other CH2 group?).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the second carbon is connected to:

- One OH,
- One CH2COOCH3,
- Two CH2 groups (like, one from each side? No, that can't be right. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps it's better to proceed and come back to this.

Let's look at the third compound: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The structure is Ph-C(O)-Ph. Now, does this have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's a carbonyl group. Carbonyl carbons don't have four substituents; they're double-bonded, so they can't be chiral centers. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus can't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is a diacid, so the ester would have two ester groups. The structure of fumarate is CH2=CH(COO-)2, but as the di-ester, it's CH2=CH(COOR)2, where R is methyl in this case. Wait, more accurately, fumarate is the trans configuration of the di-ester. So dimethyl fumarate would be:

(CH2)2C(COOCH3)2, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCHCH2CO2H, but wait, no—the structure of fumarate is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester would be (E)-CH2COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of the maleate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

No, that's not right. Let me think again. Fumarate is the di-ester of (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct: Fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COO-)2. As the di-ester, it's (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. So the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH2CH3)2. Wait, no, methyl ester, so (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. The correct structure of fumarate is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the di-ester would be (E)-CH2COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurate to represent dimethyl fumarate as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3. No, that's not the correct structure.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

CH2=CH(CO2Me)2. So the molecule is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and each of the two carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3
|
But with a double bond, so it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2?

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

The molecule is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

But what's important is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is a di-ester of maleic acid, which is a trans-diepoxy structure. Wait, no. Let me think about the molecule. Dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on a double bond. The structure is (E)-CH2-COOCH3 double bonded to CH-COOCH3. Wait, no. Alternatively, it's (E)-CH(COOCH3)-CH(COOCH3), but that would require a double bond between the two CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

(CH2COOCH3)2C=C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of whether this compound has a chiral center. If the molecule has a double bond with substituents in the trans configuration, but does that create any stereogenic centers? Wait, no. Wait, in the case of fumarate, the molecule is a trans di-ester. So the substituents on each side of the double bond are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry? Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure:

Each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups attached. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

No, perhaps it's better to think that each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups attached. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)2-CH2. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that each carbon in the double bond is attached to two ester groups. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C=C-CH2-COOCH3.

No, wait. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer of the di-ester of maleic acid. So, the correct structure is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of the structure as:

The molecule is (E)-CH2-COOCH3=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's the correct structure. So the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to an ester group (COOCH3) and a methyl group (CH2 and CH groups).

Wait, no. Let me get it straight. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that's the cis isomer. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, whereas maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the E configuration, meaning the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But does this molecule have any chiral centers? Wait, the carbons attached to the double bond each have the substituents:

For each CH in the double bond (CH=CH), each is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- and two other groups.

Wait, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons has the same substituents, making them not chiral.

Wait, the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me represent it as:

The two carbons in the double bond are each connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 or CH3 group. Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group.

Wait, no. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure becomes (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, because fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Esterifying each COOH with methyl groups would give (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) would be attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (for one end) and one CH group (for the other end? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

But that's a single bond, not a double bond. Oh wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the structure again. Let me think differently. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Or does it have geometric isomerism?

Wait, wait, perhaps the key is that dimethyl fumarate is a trans di-ester. The molecule has a plane of symmetry because the substituents are on opposite sides, making it achiral. Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule might be chiral. Wait, in the trans configuration, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 on one side and a CH2 on the other. So if the substituents are arranged trans, then each carbon is attached to two different groups, but are they arranged symmetrically?

Wait, each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but in the trans configuration, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, for each carbon, the substituents are COOCH3 and CH2. But wait, perhaps each of those carbons is a chiral center. Wait, can a carbon in a double bond be a chiral center? No, because double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized and can't have four substituents in different directions. So the carbons in the double bond can't be chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Wait, but wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. That doesn't seem right, though. Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it's not chiral. For dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. Each side mirrors the other. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, I might be wrong. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. Let me go back to compound 1.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl structure: two benzene rings connected by a single bond between their carbons 1 and 1'. The substituents are nitro at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate at 2 and 2' positions.

So each benzene ring has at positions 2 and 6 substituents. Let me imagine the structure. The central bond is between the 1 positions of each benzene. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is adjacent to position 1), and a carboxylate group at position 2 (which is opposite to position 1).

Wait, so on each benzene ring, the substituents are at 6 and 2. Are these positions symmetrical when considering the biphenyl structure?

Wait, for the first benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are on opposite sides relative to the central bond. Similarly, for the second ring. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged the same way, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let's think about it. If each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2, then the arrangement on each ring is the same. So, when you look at the molecule, each substituent is mirrored across the central bond. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of another approach. The molecule has two identical substituents on each benzene ring. If the arrangement on each ring is such that they mirror each other, then the entire molecule would be symmetrical. So, it's possible that this molecule is achiral.

So, to recap:

- Compound 1: I'm not sure, but it might be achiral.
- Compound 2: No chiral center, so no optical isomerism.
- Compound 3: No chiral center, so no.
- Compound 4: I'm not sure, but perhaps it's achiral.

Wait, but I thought that dimethyl fumarate is a di-ester that can have geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism. So it doesn't have chiral centers.

Wait, so looking back, which of the compounds have chiral centers?

Wait, let me consider another approach. For a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have at least one chiral center or another form of stereoisomerism, like in allenes or certain bridged compounds, but in this case, we're considering constitutional and stereoisomers, so probably just chiral centers.

So, which of the given compounds have a chiral center?

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's not a chiral center because the substituents are symmetrical.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. As I thought earlier, the central carbon might not be a chiral center because it has two CH2 groups attached, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's connected to four different groups. Let me think again. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon (CH2) has two identical groups (CH2 on each side), so it can't be a chiral center.

Wait, but maybe the structure is different. Let me think of the correct structure. The IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the second carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2 (connected to the first carbon),
- CH2 (connected to the third carbon),
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon would have:

- One OH,
- One CH2 group leading to the first carbon (CH3-CH2-...),
- One CH2 group leading to the third carbon (which is COOCH3),
- And another hydrogen.

So the substituents on the second carbon are:

- OH,
- CH2CH3 (from the first carbon),
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third),
- and H.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, the second carbon is the middle carbon in CH3-CH(OH)-CH2COOCH3? No, the chain is longer. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think again.

The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate part is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The second carbon (in the middle, connected to CH2OH and CH2COOCH3) is CH2, so it's attached to two CH2 groups, which are identical. Therefore, this carbon can't be a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents. So compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so maybe none of the compounds have chiral centers. But that's not possible because the options suggest some do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (for one carbon) and one CH group (for the other).

Wait, no. Actually, each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, that can't be right because fumarate is a di-ester. So each of the double-bonded carbons has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 or CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate with another structure. Let me try to clarify. Fumarate is (E)-CH2CH(COO-)2. So the ester would be (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two double-bonded carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group.

Wait, the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2. So the central double bond is between the CH2 and CH groups. Each of the CH and CH2 groups is attached to COOCH3 groups.

In this case, the CH group is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Wait, but that can't be, because each carbon in a double bond can only have three substituents (since it's sp² hybridized).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So the double bond is between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So each of the two central carbons is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (for one end) and one CH group (for the other end).

Wait, but in any case, these central carbons are double-bonded and thus sp² hybridized, meaning they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four substituents.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, there are no chiral centers. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is it an option in the choices? Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether any of the given compounds have a plane of symmetry. Let's consider each.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The substituents are symmetric on each benzene ring, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Thus, it's achiral. So no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. As discussed, no chiral center. So no.

3. benzophenone. No chiral centers. No.

4. dimethyl fumarate. No chiral centers. No.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options suggest some do. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. If dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, then the two substituents on each double-bonded carbon are the same. So each double-bonded carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 or CH group, but not four different substituents. So no chiral centers.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another possibility. What if one of the substituents is a methyl group and the rest are different? Or perhaps I'm not considering other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons has different substituents. Let me imagine the structure as:

- One carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.
- The other carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group.

Wait, no, that's not correct. I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should move on and try to determine the correct answer based on what I have.

So, if I'm correct that all four compounds don't exhibit optical isomerism, that can't be because the options don't include that. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, going back to compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- and another CH2 group? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group leading to where? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2, which is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, which is a straight chain. The second carbon is CH2, so it's attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- H,
- H.

So, the substituents are OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. Since two substituents are the same (H), the carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is different. What if it's (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, that's not the case for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon is CH2, so no chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the structure is such that the second carbon is CH(OH), making it a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure again.

Wait, the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the second carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for which options include compounds that have a chiral center.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

But according to my analysis, none of the compounds have chiral centers. But that's not possible because the options suggest some do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, perhaps each of the two central carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. But that would make each carbon a CH, which is attached to two COOCH3 and one CH2, but that would require four substituents, which isn't possible for an sp² hybridized carbon. So, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups, leading to no chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: which of these compounds have a plane of symmetry?

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, the molecule is achiral. So no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. No chiral center, so no.

3. benzophenone. No chiral center, no.

4. dimethyl fumarate. No chiral center, no.

Wait, but that would mean none of them show optical isomerism, which contradicts the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, is actually a meso compound. A meso compound has multiple stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound. So, if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, it would not exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the other compounds does have a chiral center.

Wait, let me think again about compound 2. Maybe I drew the structure wrong. Suppose the structure is different. Let's imagine the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as follows:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but if the second carbon is connected to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups, perhaps it's a chiral center. Wait, no. The substituents would be:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- H.

Wait, no, that's four different groups. Oh wait! Maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me check again. The second carbon is attached to:

- One OH,
- One CH2COOCH3 group,
- One CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- And one H.

Wait, no, that can't be because the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the second carbon is CH(OH), making it a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3. No, that's not correct because that would be isopropyl something, not propanoate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- OH,
- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group?

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, in this structure, the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- OH,
- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH group.

Wait, no, that would require four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So, in this case, the second carbon has four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH group (from the adjacent carbons).

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. I'm not confident in my analysis. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the possibility that only compound 4 has a chiral center. But earlier analysis suggests it doesn't. Hmm.

Another approach: which of these compounds have a plane of symmetry?

Benzophenone (3) has a plane of symmetry through the central carbon and the two phenyl groups. So it's achiral.

Dimethyl fumarate (4) has a plane of symmetry because the substituents are arranged trans. So it's achiral.

Compound 1: The substituents are arranged symmetrically on each benzene ring, so it's achiral.

Compound 2: If the second carbon has four different substituents, it's a chiral center. Let's reevaluate this.

If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the second carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center.

But if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the second carbon is CH(OH), attached to:

- OH,
- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but that would make four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So, in that case, compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's the structure of isopropyl ester, not propanoate. Hmm.

Wait, the IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So, the molecule would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the chain would be longer. Let me think again. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the second carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Then the second carbon is CH(OH), which would have four substituents: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because CH(OH) would have:

- OH,
- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH group.

Wait, but that would depend on the actual structure. I'm getting stuck here.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Among the options, option A includes compounds 1, 2, and 4. But according to my analysis, none of them have chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps only compound 4 has a chiral center. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps only compound 2 has a chiral center. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4. But that would mean that 1 and 4 have optical isomerism, which I'm not confident about.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that only compound 4 has optical isomerism. But earlier analysis suggested it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about each compound.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't.

But in this structure, each benzene ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. These are symmetric positions. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral. So no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. I'm not sure, but perhaps the second carbon isn't a chiral center. So no.

3. benzophenone. No.

4. dimethyl fumarate. No.

Hmm. If all four compounds don't exhibit optical isomerism, but the options don't include that, I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps only compound 4 has optical isomerism. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. For compound 1, the substituents are symmetric, so it's achiral. Compound 2, no chiral center. Compound 3, no. Compound 4, no.

So, none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 is actually a cis di-ester, making it a chiral center. No, because the trans isomer is fumarate, which is achiral. The cis isomer would be maleate, which is also achiral.

Wait, no. The di-esters of maleic acid (cis) would have a plane of symmetry, making them achiral. So, perhaps I'm stuck.

Given all this confusion, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options. The only options that include any of the compounds are:

A) 1,2,4 → I don't think any of these have optical isomerism.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No.

D) 1 and 2 → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me think once more. If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the second carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center. So no.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that none of them exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that compound 4 does have a chiral center. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the question is asking for which of the compounds show optical isomerism. The correct answer would be those that have at least one chiral center.

So, from the analysis:

- Compound 1: No chiral center.
- Compound 2: No chiral center.
- Compound 3: No.
- Compound 4: No.

Wait, but the options suggest some do. Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the double-bonded carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Thus, each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents (COOCH3 groups), so no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Maybe compound 4's structure is such that each carbon in the double bond has different substituents, leading to a chiral center. But I don't think so because it's sp² hybridized.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A) 1, 2, and 4. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps only compound 4 has optical isomerism.

Wait, another thought: in compound 1, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides relative to the rings, perhaps creating a chiral center. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

Wait, but I'm not confident. I think I'll have to go with the option that includes compound 4, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism that can lead to non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has at least one chiral center or a stereogenic element.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at positions 2 and 2'. The substituents on each benzene ring are symmetrically arranged, and the molecule likely has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (C2) is connected to:  
   - OH,  
   - CH₃,  
   - COOCH₃,  
   - and a hydrogen.  
   Since all four substituents are different, C2 is a chiral center. Thus, this compound **exhibits optical isomerism**.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the substituents on the double bond, making it **achiral**. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1: **No optical isomerism** (achiral).  
- Compound 2: **Yes, optical isomerism** (chiral center).  
- Compound 3: **No optical isomerism** (achiral).  
- Compound 4: **No optical isomerism** (achiral).  

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **Compound 2**. None of the other compounds have a chiral center or stereogenic element.
