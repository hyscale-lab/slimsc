Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D with various numbers.

First, let me list out the given data. 

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 times the Sun's mass.
But wait, mass might not directly affect the abundance ratios, but maybe it's a red herring. The question is about [Si/Fe] and other ratios.

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 times the Sun's mass. Again, not sure if this is relevant yet.

Astronomers have determined the following abundances using the EW method under LTE.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

Wait, but how do I find the silicon ratio? Because I need [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each of these abundance ratios means.

The notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, no, actually, I think for [X/Y], it's log10(n_X/n_Y) relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y observed / n_X/n_Y sun).

Alternatively, another way: the [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, normalized to the Sun's ratio.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si/n_Fe, Star1 / n_Si/n_Fe, Sun) = 0.3 → which means n_Si/n_Fe, Star1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si/n_Fe, Sun)

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe/n_H, Star1 = (n_Fe/n_H, Sun) * 10^0 = same as the Sun.

Wait, because [Fe/H] is log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10_Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe/n_H is same as Sun.

So, for Star_1, the iron abundance is the same as the Sun. So, n_Fe, Star1 = n_Fe, Sun * (n_H, Star1 / n_H, Sun).

Wait, but wait—no. Because [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe/n_H)_Star1 - log(n_Fe/n_H)_Sun =0 → n_Fe/n_H,_Star1 = n_Fe/n_H,_Sun.

So, Star_1's Fe abundance is solar.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3 → n_Si/n_Fe (Star1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But wait, (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun is n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun.

But I don't know n_Si_sun, but maybe I can find it in terms of the other elements.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find the ratio of n_Si in Star_1 and Star_2 and then find the ratio between them.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, that would be n_Si, Star1 / n_Si, Star2.

Hmm.

Let me try to model this.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → So, n_Fe, Star1 / n_H, Star1 = (n_Fe, Sun) / (n_H, Sun) → this is because [Fe/H] is zero. So, n_Fe, Star1 = (n_Fe, Sun) * (n_H, Star1 / n_H, Sun).

But wait, without knowing the hydrogen density, perhaps I can express n_Si in terms of n_Fe and the given [Si/Fe].

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means:

log10(n_Si / n_Fe, Star1 / (n_Si/n_Fe, Sun)) ) = 0.3 → n_Si/n_Fe, Star1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe, Sun).

But (n_Si/n_Fe, Sun) is (n_Si, Sun / n_Fe, Sun).

So, n_Si, Star1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si, Sun / n_Fe, Sun) * n_Fe, Star1.

But from [Fe/H]_1, n_Fe, Star1 = (n_Fe, Sun) * (n_H, Star1 / n_H, Sun).

So, substitute that into n_Si, Star1:

n_Si, Star1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si, Sun / n_Fe, Sun) * (n_Fe, Sun) * (n_H, Star1 / n_H, Sun )

Simplify: n_Si, Star1 = 10^0.3 * n_Si, Sun * (n_H, Star1 / n_H, Sun )

Wait, but what is n_H, Star1? I don't know that. Because [Fe/H] is zero, meaning that the ratio n_Fe/n_H is same as the Sun. So, n_Fe, Star1 = n_Fe, Sun * (n_H, Star1 / n_H, Sun).

Wait, but I don't have Star_1's hydrogen abundance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si, Star1 in terms of the Sun's n_Si and the Star_1's H.

Wait, maybe I should look at Star_2, because the question is about the ratio of Si in both stars.

For Star_2, given:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(n_Mg/n_Si, Star2 / (n_Mg/n_Si, Sun)) ) =0.3 → n_Mg/n_Si, Star2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si, Sun).

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(n_Mg/n_H, Star2 / (n_Mg/n_H, Sun)) )=0 → n_Mg/n_H, Star2 = n_Mg/n_H, Sun → so n_Mg, Star2 = n_Mg, Sun * (n_H, Star2 / n_H, Sun).

So, n_Mg, Star2 = n_Mg, Sun * (n_H, Star2 / n_H, Sun).

But wait, from the equation above:

n_Mg/n_Si, Star2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si, Sun) → n_Si, Star2 = n_Mg, Star2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si, Sun) )

Substitute n_Mg, Star2:

n_Si, Star2 = [n_Mg, Sun * (n_H, Star2 /n_H, Sun ) ] / [10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si, Sun) ]

Simplify:

= [n_Mg, Sun * (n_H, Star2 /n_H, Sun ) ] * [n_Si, Sun / (n_Mg, Sun * 10^0.3) ]

The n_Mg, Sun cancels out:

= [ (n_H, Star2 /n_H, Sun ) ] * [n_Si, Sun / 10^0.3 ]

So, n_Si, Star2 = (n_Si, Sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H, Star2 / n_H, Sun )

Hmm, but I'm not sure where this is going. Maybe I should find the ratio n_Si, Star1 / n_Si, Star2.

Let me write expressions for both.

n_Si, Star1 = 10^0.3 * n_Si, Sun * (n_H, Star1 / n_H_Sun )

n_Si, Star2 = (n_Si, Sun / 10^0.3 ) * (n_H, Star2 / n_H_Sun )

So the ratio:

n_Si, Star1 / n_Si, Star2 = [10^0.3 * n_Si, Sun * (n_H, Star1 / n_H_Sun ) ] / [ (n_Si, Sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H, Star2 / n_H_Sun ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [10^0.3 * n_Si_Sun * n_H_Star1 / n_H_Sun ] / [ (n_Si_Sun /10^0.3 ) * (n_H_Star2 / n_H_Sun ) ]

n_Si_Sun cancels out. The n_H_Sun in numerator and denominator cancels as well.

= [10^0.3 * n_H_Star1 ] / [ (1 /10^0.3 ) * n_H_Star2 ]

= (10^0.3 )^2 * (n_H_Star1 / n_H_Star2 )

= 10^(0.6) * (n_H_Star1 / n_H_Star2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H in Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, but maybe the stars are on the main sequence, so their temperatures and luminosities are related to their masses, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question didn't give any data about luminosity or other characteristics that would relate to the hydrogen abundance.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values. Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, so [Fe/H] means that Star_1's metallicity (Fe abundance) is the same as the Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, so its Mg abundance is solar.

Wait, but Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, but what about other elements? Like, in Star_1, Mg could have a different abundance. Wait, but in Star_1, we have [Si/Fe] =0.3, which is higher than the Sun. So, Star_1 has more Si relative to Fe than the Sun.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of Si in both stars. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can model the hydrogen in each star based on their masses. Wait, but stars' masses don't directly determine their photospheric hydrogen content. The mass relates to the gravitational pull and other factors but without knowing the star's structure, it's hard. Maybe that's not the way.

Wait,
