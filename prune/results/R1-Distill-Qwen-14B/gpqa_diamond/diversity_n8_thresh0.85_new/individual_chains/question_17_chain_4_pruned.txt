Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, the temperature is 25 °C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, Kf, indicates how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

So, the situation here is that we have the Ca-EDTA complex in solution. When this complex dissociates, it should release Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the stoichiometry. I think EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form when it complexes with metals. So the reaction is probably something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, and the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in the problem statement, it's given as the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the complex is a 1:1 ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA^4-.

Now, the solution contains 0.02 M of this complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2− is 0.02 M. But some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait. Because Kf is so large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

But I need to calculate it. Let me think about the formula.

The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I guess we can assume that the EDTA is present as EDTA^4- in solution. So the concentration of EDTA^4- is (the same as the concentration of free EDTA, assuming no other species are present in any significant amount.

Wait, but in reality, EDTA exists in solution as a mix of several protonated forms depending on pH. But given that pH is ideal, perhaps it's at a pH where EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form. So maybe I can assume that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration minus that which is complexed. Or wait, what's the total EDTA?

Wait, let me think again. In the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- when it dissociates. But because Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal.

So let's model this. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced from the dissociation. Then for every x of
