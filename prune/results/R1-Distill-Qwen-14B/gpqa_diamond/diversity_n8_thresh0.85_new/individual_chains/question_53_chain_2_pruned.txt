Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the information step by step.

The question says the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The molecular formula options are all something like C11H12O2, etc., so oxygen count is two. The functional groups present are likely an ester group since the IR shows peaks for an ester. Ester groups have carbonyls (C=O) which typically absorb around 1740-1760 cm^-1 in IR spectra.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Wait, the aromatic protons are split into two signals. That suggests the substituents on the benzene ring cause the aromatic protons to be in two different environments. So, maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be in two pairs—each pair being equivalent. Alternatively, if the substituents are in meta positions, maybe, but I think that would lead to more signals. Wait, no, di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. Let me visualize: for a 1,2 substitution (ortho), the ring would have equivalent protons only if they're in certain positions. Alternatively, a 1,4 (para) substitution. Let's think about that.

In a para-substituted benzene, you have two sets of equivalent protons. The protons adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent, and the ones opposite would be another set. Wait, no, maybe two doublets? Or perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Wait, but the substituents themselves could be in such a way that the ring's protons split into two signals. For example, if the substituents are both on the same side or opposite sides.

But wait, the di-substituted benzene has two substituents, each of which is an ester or another group. Hmm, but the ester is a substituent as a whole. So the aromatic ring is attached to an ester group and maybe another group.

Wait, looking at the NMR, besides the aromatic protons, there are also signals for vinyl-H, which suggests there's a double bond somewhere. So maybe one substituent is an ester group and another is a vinyl group attached through some chain.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, vinyl protons are typically in the range around 4.5-7 ppm. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets would mean coupling with two sets of protons, perhaps? Or maybe another splitting due to adjacent groups.

The other two signals are for –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups, each giving a singlet (if no splitting), but in this case, the signals are separate. So maybe each –CH3 is attached to different environments. For example, one methyl is attached to an oxygen (like in an ester) and the other is attached to a carbon chain elsewhere.

So putting it together: the compound is a di-substituted benzene, one substituent is an ester (O-CO-O), perhaps, and another substituent is a vinyl group connected to a chain that includes a methyl group. But wait, in the NMR, there are two –CH3 signals. So maybe the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and another group that has a methyl, like a methoxy or a methyl ester? Wait, but the ester is already one substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with an ester group and a vinyl group attached. The ester group would have a carbonyl and an OR group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and an alkoxy group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecular formula has O2. The ester group has two oxygen atoms: O and O. So that accounts for the two oxygen atoms. So the substitu
