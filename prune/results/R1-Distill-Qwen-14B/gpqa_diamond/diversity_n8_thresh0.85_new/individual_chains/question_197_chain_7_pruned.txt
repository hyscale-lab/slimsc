Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI elimination reaction, which typically leads to the formation of alkenes via the elimination of water, but wait, maybe it's more about substituting certain groups. Oh right, it's the Clemmensen reduction? No, wait, Clemmensen is with Zn(Hg) and HCl. Oh wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI, that's the reaction that's used to convert carbonyl groups into methylene groups. Or maybe it's an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data, so I'll start by analyzing those.

The IR data shows strong absorption in the 3400â€“2500 cm-1 region, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, they are all benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Benzoic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit higher if it's an ester or something else. Also, the peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic ring vibrations, like C=C stretching. So that aligns with the options given, which are all aromatic compounds.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong singlet. For aromatic compounds, this could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, in the options, I don't see any aldehydes. Alternatively, it's a carboxylic acid proton. Because carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. So maybe this is a benzoic acid derivative.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause each H to couple with two others? Or maybe it's a para-substituted ring with substituents in the ortho or meta positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with substituents that are electron-withdrawing, making the H's deshielded.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe the other set of H's in the ring. If it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent might cause the H's on either side to be split into two doublets. Like in p-xylene, but with substituents that cause different shifts.

Wait, another thought: the integration is 2H each for the two doublets. So it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So substituents at positions 1 and 4, but that's the same as position 4 and 1 in a benzene ring. So the substituents are in the para positions. So the structure is something like para-substituted benzene.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet. A methine group attached to something else. Maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl or another group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, possibly a CH2 group next to a CH or another group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, but wait, the integration is 3H. A doublet (d) suggests it's attached to a CH2 group. Like a CH(CH3) group? No, because if it's a doublet, it's attached to a CH2. Wait, 1.4 ppm, d, 3H. That's a typical methyl group attached to a CH2. For example, in an isobutyl group: CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me think. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) or maybe (CH2)2CHCH3. Hmm, maybe the structure is a CH2CH2 group attached to something else. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH that's connected elsewhere.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, but wait, a triplet in the NMR? Wait, no, the integration is 3H, and it's a triplet, which suggests it's a methyl group attached to a CH2. Because a triplet (t) in NMR usually means coupling with two adjacent protons. So, CH2CH3. So, a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a substituted benzoic acid with an ethyl chain attached. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which aligns with a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to an ethyl chain, but then the 10.5 ppm would be something else. Alternatively, it's a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester, but the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me list the options and see their structures.

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

So that's a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, attached to a propanoic acid. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be CH2-COOH attached to the benzene at position 4, with an ethyl group at position 4? Wait, no. Wait, the numbering. The propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-(4-ethylphenyl), the substituent is on the second carbon of the propanoic acid. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is benzene ring with an ethyl group at the para position, and a propanoic acid group attached as a substituent.

Wait, no, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be: the benzene is at position 4 of the propanoic acid. Wait, maybe it's propanoic acid where the second carbon is attached to the benzene ring. So structure: benzene-CH2-COOH. But then the substituent on the benzene would be an ethyl group? No, no, perhaps the substituent is on the benzene. Alternatively, the benzene is at the second carbon of the propanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm is a singlet for 1H. So that's likely the -COOH proton. So compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the aromatic protons:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Let's say these are the protons next to the substituent. So if the substituent is at position 4, then the adjacent H's (positions 3 and 5) would be ortho, and the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be meta. Wait, but in para substitution, the coupling is between adjacent H's. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is at position 4, and the aromatic protons are as follows. If there's a substituent at position 4 (say, a carbonyl group), then the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be meta to the substituent. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is at position 1, and position 4 is the opposite. Then the adjacent H's are at positions 2 and 6, which are ortho to the substituent, and positions 3 and 5, which are meta.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituent is at position 4 (but wait, that's the same as para to substituent at position 1). That would cause the H's at positions 2 and 6 to be equivalent, and the H's at 3 and 5 to be equivalent. So their NMR signals would split into two doublets. If the substituent is electron-withdrawing, the ortho H's (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield, which would be around 8.0 ppm. The meta H's (3 and 5) would be less deshielded, maybe around 7.2 ppm. So that aligns with the given NMR data.

So the substituent at position 4 is something that causes the ortho H's to be more downfield. A carbonyl group would be a strong electron-withdrawing group, so that fits. So if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR data has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but 1720 is a bit higher. Alternatively, it could be an ester or a ketone. Wait, the 10.5 ppm in the NMR is a broad singlet which is typical of a carboxylic acid proton. So I think the substituent is a carboxylic acid group.

So the structure would be 4-carboxyphenyl something. But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

Wait, but let me see the NMR for that.

If the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituents on the benzene are a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. Wait, but sec-butyl is (CH2CH(CH2CH3)), no, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. No, wait, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Or is it CH(CH2CH3)2? No. Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2- ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the NMR data again.

The NMR shows signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely the CH group in a CH2CH2 group. For example, in a sec-butyl group, you have a CH2 connected to a CH, which is connected to another CH2. So maybe the NMR is showing the CH (as the 2.9 ppm) and then the adjacent CH2 groups. Or perhaps it's a propyl chain.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) might be a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl group. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 would split the methyl into a quartet, but in this case, it's a doublet. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diastereotopic group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to the benzene. Because the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t, 3H), which is typical of a methyl group in an ethyl chain. So, the structure could have an ethyl group attached to the benzene. But let's see the other signals.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to the benzene. So perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group: CH2CH3. But that would only have the 0.9 ppm signal (the CH3) and the CH2 might appear around 1.3-1.5 ppm as a quartet. But here, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, perhaps a CH2 connected to another group.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a propyl group. But the substituent is at position 4, and the NMR shows a methyl at 0.9, a CH2 at 1.7, and a CH at 2.9. So it's like a chain: CH(CH2CH2CH3), but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group, such as a sec-butyl.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The NMR shows:

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): So this is a methyl group attached to a CH2.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A CH3 at the end of a chain, perhaps as part of an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. No, because isopropyl would have a CH(CH3)2, but the NMR doesn't show a singlet for the methyl groups.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituent as a propyl group attached to the benzene. Structure: CH2CH2CH3. But the 0.9 ppm would be the CH3, the 1.7 ppm might be the middle CH2, and the 2.9 ppm could be another CH. Wait, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Structure: CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent would be attached at position 4, and the chain would be: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl is (CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-, but that's not correct either. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, the iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the substituent as a branch. The substituent could be a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group (that's a sec-butyl group), attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but how does that fit into the NMR?

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH. So in the substituent, the structure would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch. Let's see:

The NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That would correspond to the CH group in CH(CH2CH3). So the CH would have neighboring CH2 groups, hence the multiplet.

- The CH2 groups would be split into different signals. The CH2 attached to the benzene (the first CH2) would be next to the CH group. So that CH2 would appear as a triplet or multiplet around 1.7 ppm.

The CH2CH3 (the terminal ethyl group) would have their CH3 at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but the substituent is Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group? No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, it's a 2-methylpropane group?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the substituent as a butyl group. The substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene ring. The butyl group is a four-carbon chain. Let's say it's a sec-butyl group: the structure would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a CH3 connected to a CH2. So that's a typical ethyl group.

Wait, but the substituent is at position 4, and the NMR has a CH (2.9 ppm), a CH2 (1.7 ppm), and a CH3 (0.9 ppm). So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. So structure would be: CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene. But then, the substituent would be a propyl group.

But looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) doesn't fit a propyl group. Because in a propyl group, the CH2 next to the benzene would be at around 1.6 ppm, as a triplet, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 as a triplet. But in this case, the 1.4 is a doublet, which suggests it's a methyl attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH group. Like CH2CH2 attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So the substituents on the benzene are:

- COOH at position 1.

- sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, position 4 in a benzene ring is opposite to position 1. So the substituents are para to each other.

The structure of the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So attached to the benzene, it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the NMR for the substituent would be:

The CH2 connected to the benzene (let's call it CH2-A) would be a triplet, but in the given NMR, 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, which could be that CH2. The CH group (CH-B) would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm. The CH2CH3 group (CH2CH3) would have the CH3 at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

But wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl, so the structure is:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the CH2-A (attached to benzene) would be next to CH-B (CH(CH2CH3)). The CH2-A would be a triplet if adjacent to CH-B. But in the NMR, the CH2-A is at 1.7 ppm as a multiplet. The CH-B is at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, and the terminal CH2CH3 is at 0.9 as a triplet.

Additionally, the substituent's CH2 would also be next to the CH, but I'm not sure about the splitting.

Also, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) in the NMR is a bit confusing. If the substituent is a sec-butyl, there shouldn't be a CH2 group with a doublet. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Because in that case, the CH(CH3) would have a CH2 connected to it. But then the NMR would have a triplet for the CH3 (attached to CH) but here we have a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-propyl group, but that would have a CH(CH3)2, which would give a singlet for the two CH3 groups, but in the NMR, the 1.4 is a doublet, so that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): COOH proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): ortho H's to COOH.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): meta H's.

Then the rest are for the substituent's protons.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH connected to other CH2 groups.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2 group next to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH3 connected to a CH2.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3.

Wait, so the substituent's structure could be a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a iso-butyl group: CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2. No, wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- ?

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group.

So the substituent is:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent has:

- CH2 connected to benzene.

- CH connected to CH2CH3.

So the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group, which is another name for iso-butyl.

Wait, but iso-butyl is a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, that would be a neopentyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. The substituent's structure is:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group. So the substituent is a iso-butyl group.

So the substituent is:

-CH2-
