Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here because the question is about elemental abundances, which I think relates more to their compositions than their masses. Maybe the mass is a distractor, or perhaps it's relevant later for something else, but I'll focus on the given abundances for now.

The given data is:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I remember that the notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. That is, it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the solar value.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly,
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

Wait, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, that is, n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

Hmm, to find that, I think I need to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to some standard, maybe hydrogen, and then take the ratio.

So, let's think about each star separately.

Starting with Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(n_Si/n_Fe, Star1) - log10(n_Si/n_Fe, Sun) = 0.3.

But wait, [X/Y] is usually log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y in star / n_X/n_Y in Sun) = log(n_X,n_star / n_Y,n_star * n_Y,Sun / n_X,Sun) ).

Alternatively, another way to write [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun = log_10 ( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 / (n_Si / n_Fe)_sun = 10^0.3.

Wait, but we know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe / n_H)_1 / (n_Fe / n_H)_sun = 1 → (n_Fe)_1 / (n_H)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun / (n_H)_sun.

Wait wait, no. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe / n_H) in the star minus that in the sun. So:

[Fe/H]_1 = log10( (n_Fe,1 / n_H,1) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 0 → (n_Fe,1 / n_H,1) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun).

But wait, [Fe/H] is often used as a measure of metallicity. If [Fe/H] is 0, the star has the same iron abundance as the sun relative to hydrogen.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

We know from the Sun's data:
n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5), because 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

So for Star_1, (n_Fe,1 / n_H,1) = 1e-4.5 (same as Sun).

So, Star_1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun’s.

Now, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 ) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun
