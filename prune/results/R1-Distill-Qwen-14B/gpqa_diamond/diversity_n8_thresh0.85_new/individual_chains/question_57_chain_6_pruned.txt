Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta, I think. The values are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, delta_4=13 degrees. And the rest are ignored. The incident electrons have 50 MeV of energy. I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has a certain expression involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ,φ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} (e^{2ilφ} - 1) ] * (something with spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials?), but actually, for the specific case of scattering along the beam direction, which is θ=0, right? Because along the beam, the scattering angle is 0 degrees, or 180, depending on how it's defined. Wait, no. Wait, when the particle scatters along the beam direction, the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees, because it's moving in the same direction as before. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, when the scattering is along the beam direction, it's when the particle comes in and goes out in the same direction—that's θ=0. But sometimes, people refer to the direction opposite to the beam as θ=0. Hmm. But I think in this case, the problem is asking about the direction along the beam, which would correspond to θ=0, because that's where the particle goes straight through without deflection.

But wait, the question says "along the incident beam direction," so that's when the scattered electron moves in the same direction as the incident beam. That would be backscattering, I think. Wait no, no, backscattering is when it goes backwards, 180 degrees. Oh, wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. If the incident beam is coming from a particular direction, say along the positive z-axis, then when it scatters at θ=0, it's going in the same direction as the incoming particle. So that would be no deflection—maybe like a head-on collision but maybe after a 180
