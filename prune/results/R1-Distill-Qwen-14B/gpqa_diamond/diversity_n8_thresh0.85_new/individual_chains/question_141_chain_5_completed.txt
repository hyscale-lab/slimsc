Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Wait, wait. Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, benzene derivatives. The numbering probably refers to the substituents. So the "2-d" part. Oh, wait, wait. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydrobenzene or something? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" stands for deuterium? Oh, wait, benzene-2-d could be benzene with a deuterium at position 2. But that feels a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and it's benzene-2-dimethyl or something else. Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydrobenzene? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. But why deuterium? Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the actual structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So there's a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. What's that reaction usually do? I think NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. It's often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in aromatic substitution. Alternatively, in some cases, it's used for elimination reactions. Wait, more accurately, NaNH2 is a strong base. So, in the context of aromatic substitution, perhaps it's about dehydrohalogenation, but wait, benzene rings are generally not good for elimination. Hmm. Or maybe it's about a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo elimination.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So, it's 2-deutero-1-bromobenzene. So, the molecule has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2.

Hmm, so the reaction is treating this with NaNH2 in ammonia. So, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for elimination or dehydrohalogenation. But wait, in the case of aromatic systems, perhaps it's more about dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond or something else.

Wait, but benzene is already a stable ring. So, maybe the Br is on a substituent, not on the benzene ring itself. Wait, no, the question says 1-bromobenzene, which implies that the Br is on the benzene ring in position 1. So the structure is a benzene with Br at position 1 and D at position 2.

Wait, but if that's the case, what would NaNH2 do? Maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination. But wait, on a benzene ring, all the protons are adjacent in a way. Let me think. Benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 1 has Br, position 2 has D. The positions adjacent to Br would be position 2 and 6. But position 2 has D, which is a heavier isotope but still might not abstract a proton. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction. When you have something like toluene with a leaving group, like a bromide, and you treat it with a strong base, you can get elimination. But in the case of benzene with a substituent, perhaps it's about forming a benzene ring with a triple bond adjacent to the substituent. That's the case for the formation of benzynes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the bromine is part of a side chain. Wait, but in this case, it's 1-bromobenzene, which suggests that the Br is directly attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is not benzene but a substituted benzene where the Br is in a position adjacent to another substituent, perhaps allowing for elimination to form a triple bond. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 2, then elimination could form a triple bond between them, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the problem, the substituents are Br at 1 and D at 2. So, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, where the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted from position 2 (but that's D, which is not a proton). Wait, that's an issue. Because position 2 has D, which is a deuterium, so it's a proton replaced by deuterium.

Wait, so the molecule is o-bromo-p-d-benzene? No, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2.

Wait, if the structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, then when NaNH2 is added, a strong base, perhaps abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond. But wait, in that case, the adjacent position would be positions 2 and 6.

But position 2 has D, so perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so maybe after elimination, you have a triple bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6, but wait, position 2 is D, so maybe that affects the reaction.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (which is D), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of dehydrohalogenation of a bromobenzene derivative to form a benzene with a triple bond, but I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the Br is not on the benzene ring but on a substituent. Wait, but the question says 1-bromobenzene, so the Br is at position 1. So maybe the reaction is forming a triple bond between C1 and C2, but how? Because the base would have to abstract a proton from C2 or C6.

But wait, in this case, the C2 has a D, which is a different isotope of hydrogen. So, does that affect the reaction? Because deuterium is less acidic than protium, so perhaps it's harder for the base to abstract the D from position 2. So the base would more likely abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to the Br (position 1). So, when the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton from position 6, that would create a carbanion adjacent to the Br, leading to the elimination of Br^- and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but in benzene, the ring is already conjugated and stable. So, forming a triple bond in the ring would be highly unfavorable. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. So substitution reactions typically require a good leaving group and a nucleophile. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile, so maybe elimination is more likely.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution, EAS (Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution) and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (NAS) are possible. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is part of a side chain. Wait, but the molecule is 1-bromobenzene, so the Br is directly attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe the reaction is removing H from a position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate. Benzynes are aryne intermediates, which are formed by dehydrohalogenation of haloarenes. But for that, the haloarene needs to have two leaving groups, or a way to eliminate two X groups.

Wait, but in this case, I'm only seeing one Br. So, perhaps the reaction is not about forming a benzene with a triple bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case where the Br is in a position that can undergo elimination with another substituent.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, perhaps the structure is benzene with a Br at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br.

So, the positions adjacent to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, then we have elimination of Br^- and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6, making a benzene ring with a triple bond between those positions, which would be a diene or something else.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: in aromatic substitution, when you have a haloarene treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can form a benzene ring with a triple bond, known as benzynes. For that, you need two leaving groups in adjacent positions. But in this case, I have only one Br and a D in position 2. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the D is not a leaving group but just a substituent. So, perhaps the reaction is about dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, because the D is in position 2. But wait, the D is not a leaving group, so how?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of benzene with substituents. If the substituent is at position 1 (Br), and there's a possibility of elimination, but on a benzene ring, the only way to form a triple bond would be through adjacent substituents. But here, only Br is at position 1 and D is at position 2. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that would require a hydrogen at position 6.

Wait, but in benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen unless substituted. So, if position 1 has Br and position 2 has D, then position 6 would have a hydrogen. So, the base could abstract that H, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6, making a triple bond in the ring. But that might result in a diradical or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, replacing Br with NH2. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. So, for substitution to occur, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards NAS, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. But Br is slightly deactivating, so perhaps not enough for NAS to occur easily.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, which in aromatic systems can form benzynes. Wait, let me think: for benzynes, you need two adjacent halides that can eliminate to form a triple bond. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base like NaNH2 would eliminate HBr and form a triple bond between C1 and C2, making o-benzyne.

But in this case, I have only one Br and a D. So, maybe the reaction isn't possible, but that doesn't make sense because the question is asking about possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a mistake, and it's another substituent. Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene, but no, the question says 'd', which is likely deuterium.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a typo, and it's a methyl group. But let's proceed with the given info.

Let's think again. The reaction is NaNH2 in ammonia. That's a strong base. So, perhaps the Br is eliminated, along with a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon, to form a triple bond. But in this structure, the adjacent carbons to Br are position 2 (D) and position 6. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, if that's the case, would that form a single product? Because the only possible hydrogen to abstract is from position 6. So, perhaps only one product is formed, making option B)1 correct.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the D at position 2 acts as a deuterium, which doesn't get abstracted because it's less acidic. So the base can't abstract from position 2, so the only H available is from position 6. So, elimination occurs between position 1 and 6, forming a triple bond there. So that's one product.

But then, wait, what if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 or 4? No, because they are not adjacent to Br. So, only positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Br. But position 2 has D, which the base can't abstract (since D is less acidic and perhaps the base isn't strong enough to deprotonate D, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it can. Wait, but deuterium is more acidic than regular H in some cases, but generally, it's less so. Wait, actually, the acidity of deuterium is slightly higher than protium because of the isotope effect, but in practice, deprotonating D requires more vigorous conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the base is NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a very strong base. So perhaps it can abstract the D from position 2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but if that happens, then we would have two possible products: one where the triple bond forms between C1 and C2 (due to elimination from position 2), and another where it forms between C1 and C6 (elimination from position 6). But wait, if both are possible, then how many products would that yield?

Wait, but wait, if the base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) from position 2, which is adjacent to Br, then the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But if the base abstracts from position 6, the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. So each elimination would give a different product.

But how many different products would that be? Let's think about the structure.

Benzene is a symmetric molecule. So positions 2 and 6 are equivalent in some cases. Wait, but in this case, position 2 has D, so it's a different substituent. So, the molecule isn't symmetric anymore. So, elimination from position 2 would give a different product than elimination from position 6.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, when elimination occurs, if the base abstracts from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then the triple bond forms between C1 and C6. That would give a different product than if it abstracts from position 2 (which has D).

Wait, but if the base abstracts H from position 6, then we form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But in the ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent in a six-membered ring, so would that be the same as 1 and 2?

Wait, no. Because the numbering is 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6. So, position 6 is next to position 1 (as 1 is connected to 2 and 6). So, if the elimination is between 1 and 6, that's a different product from elimination between 1 and 2.

But wait, in the benzene ring, the ring is symmetric, so maybe some of these products are the same. Let me imagine the benzene ring.

Imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1. Position 2 has D, and position 6 has H. So, the base could abstract H from position 6, leading to elimination and forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. Alternatively, could the base abstract H from position 2? But position 2 has D, so perhaps not, unless the base is strong enough.

Wait, but D is a heavier isotope, but in terms of acidity, deuterium is slightly less acidic than hydrogen, so it's harder to abstract. So, in this case, the base (NH2^-) would preferentially abstract the H from position 6 rather than D from position 2.

Therefore, elimination would occur at position 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6. So only one product is formed.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the reaction can occur in such a way that the triple bond could form in more than one position, leading to different products. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but undergoes substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, but under these conditions, only one such product is possible.

But then, the question is, how many possible products are there? So, if only one product is formed, the answer would be B)1.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking and instead substitution occurs, but I can't see how that would happen. Alternatively, maybe the starting material undergoes some other reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the NaNH2 is deprotonating a position leading to a ring expansion or contraction, but that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about isotope exchange, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is a substituent, and the reaction is about substitution of Br with something else, but I don't see how.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's used in a dehydrohalogenation. So, if the molecule is o-bromobenzene with a deuterium in position 2, the base would abstract a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but if that's the case, how many different products are possible? Because the ring is symmetric, but the substituents are not. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, and the D at position 2. But wait, the product would have a triple bond in the ring, making it a diene or something else. Wait, benzene with a triple bond would become a cyclohexa-1,3-diene or similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene with a triple bond between 1 and 2, but that would require elimination from position 2, which has D. But since D is less likely to be abstracted, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction results in the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, leading to a single product. So, the number of products is 1, making option B the correct answer.

Wait, but wait: when the triple bond forms, the positions would create different stereochemistry. But in the case of benzene, the ring can rotate, so any triple bond would be the same in terms of structure. Or, perhaps, the triple bond could form in two different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this case, the only possible position for elimination is position 6. So, only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination can occur from position 2 as well, but only if the base can abstract the D, which is less likely. So, perhaps two possible products: one where the triple bond is between 1 and 6, and another between 1 and 2. But if the base can abstract from position 6 but not 2, then only one product is formed.

But given that NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps it can abstract D from position 2. Let me think: the acidity of D is slightly higher than H in some cases (like in CH3D vs CH3Cl), but in aromatic systems, I'm not sure. So, perhaps the base can abstract H from position 6 and D from position 2, leading to two possible eliminations and thus two products.

Wait, but if the base can abstract both H and D, then two products would form: one with the triple bond between 1 and 6 (from H abstraction), and another between 1 and 2 (from D abstraction). However, since D is a different isotope, would that lead to a different product?

Alternatively, perhaps the D is just a substituent and doesn't affect the reaction. So, the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to a single product with a triple bond between 1 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the D is just a deuterium, so the product would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, and the D would remain at position 2. But wait, when the triple bond forms, what happens to the substituents?

Wait, forming a triple bond would require two adjacent carbons. So, in 1-bromo-2-d benzene, elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2 (if D is at C2), or between C1 and C6.

Wait, but the triple bond between C1 and C2 would require elimination from C2. But C2 has D, so that would require abstracting D, which is less likely. So, perhaps only the elimination from C6 would proceed, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C6. So, only one product is formed.

But wait, perhaps when the triple bond forms, the substituents (Br and D) would influence the product. So, the triple bond could form between 1 and 2 or 1 and 6, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but instead results in the substitution of Br with something else. But I can't think of a substitution reaction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group or another substituent, but I don't see how NaNH2 would do that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about removing a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which could then lead to some rearrangement. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to think of the possible products. If elimination occurs, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond. The possible positions for the triple bond would depend on where the H is abstracted. So, from position 6, triple bond between 1 and 6; from position 2, triple bond between 1 and 2. But since position 2 is deuterated, perhaps only one product forms, making option B)1 the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms two products because the triple bond can form in two different positions, but I'm not sure if that's possible given the substituents.

Wait, another thought: when the triple bond forms between C1 and C6, the ring would have a triple bond and the D would be at position 2. But in that case, the structure is unique, so only one product. Similarly, if the triple bond forms between C1 and C2, the D would be attached to the triple bond carbon, but that would change the structure.

Wait, but in reality, the benzene ring can't have a triple bond between C1 and C2 because that would mean adjacent carbons with a triple bond, which is possible, but in that case, the substituents would be on the same carbon as the triple bond. Hmm, perhaps that's not favorable.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking, and instead, the Br is substituted by something else. But I'm not seeing how that would happen with NaNH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about dehydrohalogenation forming a benzyn, which could then undergo some addition reactions. But without another substituent, I'm not sure.

Another angle: perhaps the deuterium is a red herring, and the reaction is a simple elimination yielding a single product. So the answer is B)1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different products due to different possible eliminations.

Wait, perhaps the D is not in position 2 but another position. No, the question states 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so position 2 has D.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to two products because the triple bond could form in two different positions, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible products. If elimination occurs from position 6, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and D at position 2. If elimination occurs from position 2, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and D is at position 2 (but that would be the same as the starting material, which doesn't make sense). Wait, no, if the base abstracts D from position 2, then elimination would occur between C1 and C2, leading to a triple bond there. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, and no D because it was abstracted. Wait, but deuterium is a substituent, so abstracting it would change the structure.

Wait, but how would that happen? If the base abstracts D from position 2, then the C2 would lose D and the Br would leave. So, the structure would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and the D would be gone. But that's a different product than if the base had abstracted H from position 6.

So, if both eliminations are possible, then two products would form: one with triple bond between 1 and 2, and one between 1 and 6. But considering the substituents, perhaps both are possible, leading to two products. That would make option C)2 the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the base can abstract D from position 2. Because D is less acidic, maybe the base prefers to abstract H from position 6. So only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract H from position 6 and D from position 2, leading to two different products. So, two products would form, making option C)2 correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let's think about the acidity. The order of acidity for protons adjacent to substituents can influence where the base abstracts. But in this case, position 2 has D, which is less acidic than H. So, the base would prefer to abstract H from position 6.

Therefore, only one product is formed, making option B)1 the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But in the benzene ring, the positions are numbered in a way that C1 and C6 are adjacent. So, the product would be a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, and the D would be at C2.

But wait, the ring would then have a triple bond, which is a different structure. So, the product would be a dienyne or something else. But in any case, only one product is formed.

Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1, so the answer is B)1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for dehydrohalogenation reactions. In this case, the base can abstract a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine atom, leading to the elimination of the bromine and the formation of a triple bond in the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, meaning the bromine is at position 1 and the deuterium is at position 2 on the benzene ring. The positions adjacent to the bromine are position 2 (deuterium) and position 6 (hydrogen).

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   NaNH₂ acts as a strong base, abstracting a proton or deuterium from a position adjacent to the bromine. This leads to the elimination of the bromine atom and the formation of a triple bond between the carbon atoms at the elimination sites.

3. **Possible Elimination Sites**:  
   - **Position 2**: Contains a deuterium atom. While deuterium is less acidic than protium, NaNH₂ is a strong base and could potentially abstract the deuterium, leading to elimination and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.  
   - **Position 6**: Contains a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen is more acidic than deuterium, and the base is more likely to abstract it, leading to elimination and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.

4. **Symmetry and Products**:  
   The benzene ring is symmetric, but the substituents (bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) break the symmetry. This means that elimination at position 2 and position 6 would lead to structurally distinct products.  
   - If elimination occurs at position 6, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6.  
   - If elimination occurs at position 2, the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.

5. **Likelihood of Each Pathway**:  
   Deuterium is less acidic than hydrogen, so the base is more likely to abstract the hydrogen from position 6. This makes the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 more favorable. However, the reaction conditions allow for the possibility of both eliminations, leading to two distinct products.

### Conclusion:
The reaction can produce two different organic products, depending on which hydrogen (or deuterium) is abstracted. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **2**.

Answer: C
