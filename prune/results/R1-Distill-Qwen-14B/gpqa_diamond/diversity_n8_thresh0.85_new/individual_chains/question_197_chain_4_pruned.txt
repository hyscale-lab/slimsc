Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what it becomes after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, probably indicating O-H or N-H groups. But looking at the options, they're either carboxylic acids or substituted benzene rings. So, maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid group. The other peaks: 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits. 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10. But wait, another possibility is that it's a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, often as broad signals because they exchange easily. So the 10.5 ppm could be an -OH from a carboxylic acid. 

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like a pair of doublets, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, perhaps with two substituents that are meta to each other. Wait, no. For a para-substituted group, the protons would be as two doublets. Like, if there's an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents that are para to each other, each causing splitting. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent at the para position, and the aromatic protons are ortho to that substituent. Wait, let me think. If the substituent is at the para position, then the two adjacent protons (ortho) would couple with each other, and the meta ones would perhaps not. Hmm, maybe the substituent is a nitro group or something else that deshields the protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 4 and a substituent at position 4 as well? Wait, no, position 4 can't have two groups. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4? No, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid is at position 1, and another substituent is at position 4. Or maybe the substituent is at position 4, and the carboxylic acid is at position 1. 

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets: 8.0 and 7.2. Each is a doublet and each has 2H. So perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents, each meta to each other. Or maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Let me think about the splitting. For a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to each substituent would be ortho to substituent, and they might couple with each other. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group or a carbonyl group that causes the two sets of protons to split into doublets. 

Wait, if the ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid), then the ring protons would be deshielded. So the two protons ortho to the substituent would be deshielded and split into doublets. 

So, the 8.0 ppm is probably the ortho protons to the substituent, and 7.2 is the para position. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene with a strong substituent (like a nitro group), the ortho protons would be more deshielded and appear downfield. So the 8.0 ppm would be the ortho protons, and the 7.2 could be the meta. Wait, no, in a para substituent, the ortho and para protons would be in certain positions. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the ring has a substituent at one position and another substituent elsewhere, leading to two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a substituent where the two ortho protons are each split into doublets.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituent. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound has a ketone, ester, or an acid. But the 10.5 ppm in NMR is broad, which suggests it's an -OH, more likely a carboxylic acid (since aldehydes are usually sharp). So, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5. So for benzoic acid, the -COOH proton is a broad peak, which fits. Then, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So each is a doublet of 2H. For a para-substituted benzene, if there's a substituent in the para position, the ortho protons would couple with each other, each giving a doublet. So, for example, if the ring has a substituent at position 4, the ortho protons at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent and each would split into a doublet, each integrating to 2H. So the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm could correspond to these ortho protons.

Wait, but benzoic acid has the substituent at position 1, so the substituent is at position 1 (the COOH). Then, the substituent in position 4 would be the sec-butyl group. So, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. 

So, the aromatic protons would be: positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH group, so they would be deshielded. Positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the sec-butyl group. Wait, or perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ortho and para positions are involved.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, making them para to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the COOH group and meta to the sec-butyl. Positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to sec-butyl. 

Wait, but if the substituents are para, then each substituent would influence the adjacent protons. For example, the COOH at position 1 would cause the protons at 2 and 6 to be more deshielded (downfield), and the sec-butyl at position 4 would cause the protons at 3 and 5 to be more shielded (upfield) or deshielded, depending on the substituent's nature. 

Wait, but wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl group, which is electron-donating via the inductive effect. So the protons next to the sec-butyl would be more shielded, appearing upfield. The COOH group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons next to it would be more deshielded, appearing downfield.

So, the two protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be downfield, say around 8 ppm. The two protons ortho to the sec-butyl group (positions 3 and 5) would be upfield, around 7.2 ppm. That matches the NMR data: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H).

So the aromatic region suggests that the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4, which are para to each other. The substituents are a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR data shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with the -COOH proton. Also, the other peaks in NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These seem to correspond to a butyl group.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think about the structure. The sec-butyl group is a four-carbon
