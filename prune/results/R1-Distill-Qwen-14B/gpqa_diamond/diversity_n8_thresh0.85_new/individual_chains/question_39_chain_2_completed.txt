Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, 'i' is the imaginary unit here. But when we're talking about the wave function, it's usually a complex function, right? But when it comes to probabilities, we're interested in the probability density, which is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 and x > 3. That means the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3. Oh wait, no, the wave function isn't necessarily zero there, but the probability of finding the particle there is zero. So the probability density, which is |ψ(x)|², must be zero outside of x=1 to 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Let's compute the square of the absolute value. The absolute value of ψ is sqrt( (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2 ). So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the particle isn't found outside x=1 and x=3. That implies that the probability of finding the particle in regions x<1 and x>3 is zero. So the probability density must be zero in those regions? Or wait, actually, the probability in those regions must be zero because no particles were found there. So the wave function must be zero in those regions. Because if the wave function isn't zero, there would be some probability density, right?

Wait, but the wave function can't be zero everywhere outside x=1 and x=3 because it's a valid wave function in between. So maybe the wave function itself is zero outside that interval. Because if the wave function is non-zero outside, the probability wouldn't be zero there.

So let's think about the wave function. The given ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let's consider the real and imaginary parts. The real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but for the wave function to be zero at x=1 and x=3, the real part must be zero there. Because if ψ(1)=0, then real part a/sqrt(2) must be zero, which can't happen unless a=0, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3, meaning the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3. So the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So for this to be zero at x=1 and x=3, the real part must be zero at those points. Wait, at x=1, real part is a/sqrt(2). So setting that to zero would imply a=0, which is impossible. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the wave function is such that the probability is zero outside x=1 and x=3. So the probability density |ψ(x)|² is zero for x <1 and x>3. But for that to happen, the wave function must be zero outside, because |ψ|² can't be zero everywhere unless ψ is zero. So perhaps the given wave function is the same as a valid wave function only between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside. But the given expression is for a part of space where the particle can exist, which is between 1 and 3.

Wait, the problem says the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i in the part of space where the particle can exist. So that part is from x=1 to x=3, as the measurements show the particle only there.

Wait, but the wave function is given as that expression in that region. So perhaps the wave function doesn't exist elsewhere, so it's zero outside. So the given ψ(x) is between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So we can ignore the rest of the space.

But why is that? Because the problem states that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside. So that's why the wave function is given for x=1 to 3, and is zero elsewhere.

But then, within x=1 to x=3, the wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i.

Wait, but this wave function has an imaginary part. So the probability density is |ψ|² = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But for this to be a valid wave function, the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1 (since it's normalized). Because the probability of finding the particle in the entire allowed region should be 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So let's set up the integral:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Breaking this into two terms:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Second term: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the equation becomes:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute this value.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

But wait, let me double-check the setup. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, so the square of the absolute value is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So yes, that's correct.

So integrating from 1 to 3 gives the sum I did. The calculation seems correct.

So a is approximately 0.85, which matches option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we analyze the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) and use the normalization condition for wave functions. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this region, and the normalization condition requires the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( [1, 3] \) to equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \).  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( 1 \) to \( 3 \):  
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \).  
   This is straightforward:  
   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):  
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
