Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the orbital configuration.

Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, they have the same masses, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_1 has a shorter period, it's orbiting closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to distance through Kepler's laws.

The stars are interesting. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radii. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Wait, evolved stars are usually larger, but here their radii are the same. So, same size but different masses. That might affect the probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh wait, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s * (1 + m_p / M_s)) ) ), but maybe I'm mixing up some parts.

Wait, no, the actual formula I think is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a / (R_s (1 + m_p / M_s))) ) ? Or maybe it's more about the inclination. Oh, right, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned so that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability is given by (R_s * sin i) / a, but since i is the inclination, and we're considering edge-on (i=90 degrees) as the only transiting case, the probability depends on the relative size and the orbital distance.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the formula provided in some sources. The transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (a * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) / (2π * R_s * (1 + m_p / M_s)) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. Or maybe I'm complicating it. Let me check the probability formula again.

I think the standard formula for the probability of a planet transiting is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (a / (2 * R_s * (1 + M_p / M_s))) ) )? Or something along those lines. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. The probability is roughly (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by ( (R_p / R_s) )² )? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is higher when the orbital distance is smaller. Because a planet closer to the star has a higher chance of its orbital plane being edge-on relative to us, given that the star's size is smaller in the sky from the planet's perspective. Hmm. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but with some conditions.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. So P ≈ (R_s / a)^2, because the area that the planet can transit is a circle with radius R_s, and the orbital area is something else. Wait, no, perhaps the probability is (R_s / a)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I recall that the probability can be approximated by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / ( (a / R_s) * (1 + M_p / M_s) )) ). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. So, the probability is higher when the planet is larger, the star is smaller, and the planet is closer (smaller a). Since in both cases, the stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s. So R_s cancels out in the probability ratio.

Let's list the given data:

- Both planets have same mass (M_p1 = M_p2)
- Period P1 = P2 / 3 → since P is related to a^3/(M_total) via Kepler's third law. So for a planet, the period is shorter when it's closer.

Wait, the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis a and the total mass (M_s + M_p) via Kepler's third law: (P^2) = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) * a^3. But since M_p is much smaller than M_s (planets are Earth-like, so M_p << M_s), we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So P^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M_s)) ) a^3 → a^3 = (G M_s P²) / (4 π²) → a ≈ [ (G M_s P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

So for Planet_1, a1 = [ (G (2 M_s) (P1)^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

And Planet_2's a2 is [ (G (M_s) (P2)^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

But P1 = P2 / 3. Let me substitute P1 = P2 / 3 into a1's equation.

So a1 = [ (G (2 M_s) ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Which simplifies to:

= [ (2 M_s G P2² )/( 4 π² ) * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/(9 *4)) * (M_s G P2^2 )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express a1 in terms of a2. Since a is proportional to (M_s * P² )^(1/3 ), but with M_s for Planet_1 being twice as M_s2.

Wait, M_s1 = 2 M_s2.

So let me express a1 in terms of a2.

We have:

a1^3 ∝ M_s1 * P1² → (2 M_s2) * (P2²/9) )

a2^3 ∝ M_s2 * P2² → M_s2 * P2²

So a1^3 = (2/9) * M_s2 * P2² = (2/9) * (a2^3) )

So a1 = [ (2/9) )^(1/3) ] * a2

The cube root of (2/9) is approximately cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately. 2/9 is approximately 0.222222.

The cube root of 0.222222 is equal to (0.222222)^(1/3). Let's compute:

0.6³ = 0.216, which is 0.216. 0.605³ = approx 0.605*0.605=0.366, 0.366*0.605 ≈ 0.221. So 0.605^3 ≈ 0.221. So 2/9 is about 0.222, so cube root is about 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

Okay, so Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2. Now, what's the transit probability?

Transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The probability is higher when the planet is closer (smaller a) because the angle needed for alignment is smaller. 

I think the formula for the transit probability can be approximated as (R_s / a)^2. Because when a is smaller, the probability is higher. Alternatively, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / a )^2. Wait, perhaps the exact formula is (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2 (1 + M_p/(M_s)))²) )? Hmm, not sure. But let's think in terms of the factors involved.

Since both R_s are same, R_s1 = R_s2 = R. So R cancels out.

The transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / (R_s))^2 * (1 / (a (1 + M_p/(M_s))) )^2.

Wait, but in reality, since M_p << M_s, 1 + M_p/M_s ≈ 1. So that term is negligible. So the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / R)^2 * (1 / a)^2.

Wait, but both planets have the same mass, but the question says they are Earth-like, so R_p is the same for both. So R_p is same for both. So R_p/R is same. So the only factor is 1/a².

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is approximately (R_s / a)^2, but multiplied by other factors. Alternatively, the formula is (R_s / a)^2 * (R_p / R_s)^2. So that would be (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (a^2 R_s^2) ) → (R_p²) / a².

Wait, but that can't be right because R_p is fixed, so then P is inversely proportional to a². So the closer planet has higher probability.

Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is given by (R_p)/(R_s) squared multiplied by ( (a) / (R_s (1 + M_p/M_s)) ) ) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should think of it another way.

The transit probability depends on the ratio of the size of the star to the orbital distance. If the planet's orbit is much larger than the star, the chance of alignment is lower. So, for each planet, the probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2.

So, P ∝ (R_s / a)^2.

But since R_s is same for both, P is proportional to 1/(a)^2.

So we can compute the ratio of P for Planet_1 to Planet_2: (a2 / a1)^2.

Because P1 is proportional to (R_s / a1)^2, and P2 is (R_s / a2)^2. So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

We found earlier that a1 ≈ 0.605 a2. So a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.605 ≈ 1.652.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.652)^2 ≈ 2.73.

So P1 is about 2.73 times higher than P2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a1 is smaller than a2, R_s is same, then P1 is higher.

Wait, wait, let me recheck that.

If a1 is smaller, then R_s/a1 is larger, so (R_s/a1)^2 is larger, so P1 is higher.

So if a1 is 0.605 a2, then a2 = a1 / 0.605 → a2 is about 1.652 a1.

So (R_s / a1)² is (1/a1)^2, and (R_s / a2)² is (1/a2)^2 = (1/(1.652 a1))² = (1/1.652²) * (1/a1)^2 → which is approximately 0.36 * (1/a1)^2.

So the P for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of (1/0.36) → about 2.77.

Wait, so P1 is approximately 2.77 times higher than P2.

But looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. So that would be the case.

Wait, but let me confirm the a1 and a2 calculations.

Earlier, Kepler's law: a^3 ∝ (M_s) * P^2.

So a1^3 = (M_s1) * (P1)^2 → M_s1 is 2 M_s2, and P1 is P2/3.

a1^3 = 2 * ( (P2/3) )^2 = 2 * (P2² /9) ) → 2/9 * P2².

a2^3 = M_s2 * P2² → since M_s2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

But wait, M_s1 is twice M_s2, so M_s2 = M_s, M_s1 = 2 M_s.

So a1^3 = (2 M_s) * (P2^2 / 9 )

a2^3 = M_s * P2^2

So a1^3 = (2/9) M_s P2^2 → which is (2/9) times a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 ≈ 0.2222 → cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2. So researchers would prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred with ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given data and use the principles of orbital mechanics and transit probability.

### Key Information:
1. **Planetary Masses and Orbital Periods**: Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), meaning it is closer to its star.
2. **Host Star Properties**: The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2 (\( M_{s1} = 2M_{s2} \)), but both stars have the same radius (\( R_{s1} = R_{s2} = R_s \)).

### Transit Probability:
The transit probability \( P \) depends on the orbital distance \( a \) and the size of the star \( R_s \). A closer planet (smaller \( a \)) has a higher transit probability because the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight is more likely. The probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2 \).

### Orbital Distance Calculation:
Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_s P^2 \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{s1} P_1^2}{M_{s2} P_2^2} = \frac{2M_{s2} \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{s2} P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Transit Probability Ratio:
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2 \). Since \( R_s \) is the same for both stars, the probability ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2.
\]
Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72.
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Conclusion:
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability.
