Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis typically involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually Ruthenium-based, right? It's used for ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metathesis reactions.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that out. Pent means five carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene should be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent is five carbons. So it's 1,2,3,4,5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then the 3rd carbon has a methyl group. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's five carb
