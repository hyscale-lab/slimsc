Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, Li is Lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons. Because Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons make it Li-6.

So I need to find the energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy isn't just (1/2)mv², because at high speeds, the kinetic energy becomes a significant part of the total energy.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So first, I should calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is, um, let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, 0.28 times 3.5714 would be 1, right? Because 3.5714 is about 25/7, since 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.5714. So yes, gamma is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need its mass. Wait, the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c², but I think the exact value might be more precise.

Wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but for calculations, perhaps we can take an average or use the mass number multiplied by the mass of a nucleon.

Wait, but Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron
