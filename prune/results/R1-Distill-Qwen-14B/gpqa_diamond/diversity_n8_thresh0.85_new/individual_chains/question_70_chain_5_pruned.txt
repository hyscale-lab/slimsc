Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions and molecular symmetry groups. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a series of reactions, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups relate to the shapes of molecules. So, the first task is to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me read through the reactions again carefully.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think what reaction would produce a bright red solid. Oh wait, maybe it's a metal reacting with a halogen? Like copper and sulfur? Or perhaps something else. Oh, wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium sulfate and B is something else? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide reacting with a halogen gas.

Wait, another possibility: I remember that when some metals react with halogens, they form colored products. For example, sodium reacts with chlorine to form sodium chloride, but that's a white solid. Copper reacts with chlorine to form copper(II) chloride. Wait, but is that bright red? Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another angle: the product C is used in another reaction, so perhaps C is a compound that can undergo further reactions. Let's look at the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Oh, E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, maybe something like phosgene? Or perhaps another toxic gas like chlorine or something else.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze? Or maybe C is a metal chloride that, when reacted with water, produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, then hydrolysis would produce a strong acid and a weak acid's conjugate base. Or maybe the other way around. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction is A + 8 B → C. 8 equivalents suggest maybe a 1:8 stoichiometry. So, like, 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B. What reactions have that ratio? Maybe something like aluminum reacting with chlorine? Let's think, aluminum reacts with chlorine gas to form AlCl3, but the stoichiometry is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. Hmm, that's 3/2 moles of Cl2 per mole of Al, but that's not 8. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. For example, something like Na (solid) reacting with Cl2 (gas). The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. That's 1 mole of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na, so 1:2. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen, but in a different stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. Wait, what if A is an element that forms a compound with B in an 8:1 ratio? Let me think about possible compounds.

Wait, another approach: let's list possible products C that would fit the other reactions. C reacts with D (a gas) in 1:2 ratio to form E. Then, C reacts with water to produce A and two acids. So, perhaps C is a salt, such as a metal chloride, which upon reaction with water (hydrolysis) would form a metal hydroxide (which could be A) and an acid.

Wait, but in the first reaction, C is produced from A and B. So if C is a chloride, then A could be a metal. Let me think: if A is a metal, say sodium, then B could be chlorine gas. The reaction would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's 1 mole of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na. Not 8, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is an oxide. For example, if A is sodium oxide (Na2O), reacting with B (maybe O2?) But that doesn't fit because O2 is a gas, and the product would be NaO2? Not sure.

Wait, maybe B is not a halogen. Let me think of other possibilities. Another reaction that forms bright red product could be the synthesis of sulfur. No, that's when elements combine, like in a reaction producing S8. But that's solid, but the initial reaction is with solid A and gas B.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a complex like CuSO4, but that's blue, not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a
