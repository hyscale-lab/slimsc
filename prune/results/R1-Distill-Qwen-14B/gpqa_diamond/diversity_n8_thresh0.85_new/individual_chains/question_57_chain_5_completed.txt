Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about finding the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

From what I remember, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The general formula involves the phase shifts δ_l. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) exp(iδ_l - δ_l) ) * (something with Legendre polynomials... wait, maybe that's when you sum over all the angular momentum states. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, wait, along the beam direction would be θ = 0 degrees or θ = 180 degrees? Wait, in scattering, θ is the angle between the incident direction and the scattered direction. So the beam direction is θ = 0, and the direction opposite is θ = π, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says "along the incident beam direction." So maybe that's θ=0. But wait, for θ=0, the scattering is forward direction. But what about the scattering amplitude's imaginary part there.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by f(θ) = sum over l of ( (2l + 1) / (k) ) * ( exp(iδ_l) - 1 ) * P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial of order l. So the imaginary part of f would be the imaginary parts of each term in the sum.

But wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ_0, δ_1, etc., as given. Oh wait, the data given is δ_0=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13 degrees. So that's for l=0 to l=4, I guess. Because each δ_l is for a specific angular momentum state l.

Wait, but the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over all possible l, each term involving (2l+1) and (exp(iδ_l) -1) multiplied by the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ), all divided by k.

But the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam. So that would be θ=0, right? So I need to compute the imaginary part of f(0) for θ=0.

Wait, what's the value of P_l(1)? Because cosθ=1 when θ=0. And I recall that P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials at cosθ=1 (θ=0) is 1 for any l. So each P_l(1) is 1.

So then, the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the sum over l of the imaginary part of ( (2l+1)/(k) ) * (exp(iδ_l) -1 ), since P_l(1) is 1.

Wait, but wait, the amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ)

So along θ=0, each term becomes (2l+1)(e^{i delta_l} -1) * 1 / k.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of the imaginary parts of each (2l+1)(e^{i delta_l} -1) divided by k.

Wait, but what's k? Hmm, k is the wave number. Since the electrons are 50 MeV, I'll need to compute k in units that make sense. Units are in MeV, so let's calculate k in appropriate units.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives the options in fm (femtometers), so perhaps the answer is in units of fm. So I need to compute k.

Wait, the electrons are 50 MeV. I think the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the relativistic expression for the momentum p of an electron with energy E (but non-relativistically, perhaps? Wait, 50 MeV is a high energy for electrons. But maybe the problem uses the non-relativistic formula because it's a scattering problem, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the relativistic expression.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think: The wave number k is (p)/ħ, where p is the momentum. For electrons, the momentum can be found using the kinetic energy. But at 50 MeV, that's a significant fraction of the rest mass energy, which is about 0.511 MeV. So 50 MeV is much higher than the rest mass. So we need to use the relativistic formula.

The energy E is given as 50 MeV. For a free particle, the energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So solving for p: p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

But wait, we can express k as p/ħ. So let's compute p first.

Let me plug in the numbers. The mass m is the electron mass, which is about 0.511 MeV/c².

So E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 2500 - 0.261 ) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9974 MeV.

So p = (49.9974 MeV) / c.

Therefore, k = p / ħ = (49.9974 MeV/c) / ħ .

Wait, but what are the units here? Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm. So ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.3 MeV fm).

Wait, but let's compute k in units of 1/fm.

Since p = (49.9974 MeV/c ) * c = 49.9974 MeV.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe we should write p in terms of MeV/c.

Wait, let me think again: E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So (p c) = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

But wait, because (p c) is about 50 MeV, because m c² is negligible compared to E (50 MeV is much larger than 0.511 MeV).

So p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / ħ.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.3 MeV fm) → unit conversion.

So k = [50 MeV / c ] / ħ = (50 MeV) / (ħ c) * (1/c) * c = ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k as:

k = (p) / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) * c → Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of units.

Alternatively, let's compute k in units of 1/fm.

We have ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm.

So, 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.3 MeV fm) → 1/(197.3 MeV fm) = (1 fm) / (197.3 MeV).

So, p c = 50 MeV → p = (50 MeV) / (c).

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ).

But ħ c = 197.3 MeV fm → ħ = (197.3 MeV fm) / (c) → Wait, perhaps to get k in 1/fm, let's express it as:

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ ) .

But ħ = (197.3 MeV fm) / (c) → So,

k = [50 MeV/(c)] / [ (197.3 MeV fm) / (c) ) ] = (50 MeV) / (197.3 MeV fm ) * (c/c) ) → The c's cancel. So,

k = 50 / 197.3 ≈ 0.2533 fm^-1.

Wait, because 197.3 is approximately 200, 50/200 is 0.25, so 0.2533 is close.

So k ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that would make sense because 197 MeV fm is about the scale of the Compton wavelength for electrons.

Now, the next part is to compute the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum over l of (2l+1) * Im[ exp(i δ_l) - 1 ].

Wait, because each term in the sum is (2l+1)/(k) * (exp(i δ_l) - 1) → and the imaginary part is (2l+1)/(k) * Im[ exp(i δ_l) - 1 ].

But exp(i δ_l) = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So exp(i δ_l) -1 = (cos δ_l - 1) + i sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part is sin δ_l.

So Im[ exp(i δ_l) -1 ] is sin δ_l.

So putting it together, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, I think.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. So l goes from 0 to 4.

So for each l, we have (2l+1) * sin δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 2*0 +1 =1. δ0=90°, so sin(90°)=1. So term is 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: 2*1 +1=3. δ1=67°, sin(67) ≈ 0.9205.

So term is 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: 2*2+1=5. δ2=55°, sin(55) ≈ 0.8192. So term is 5 * 0.8192≈4.096.

l=3: 7. δ3=30°, sin(30)=0.5. So 7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4: 9. δ4=13°, sin(13)=approx 0.22495. So 9 * 0.22495≈2.02455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 =3.7615.

+4.096 → 7.8575.

+3.5 → 11.3575.

+2.02455 → 13.38205.

So sum is approximately 13.38205.

Now multiply by (1/k) which is 1/(0.2533 fm⁻¹) → 1/k ≈ 3.949 fm.

So Im[f(0)] ≈ 13.38205 * 3.949 fm.

Let me compute 13.38205 * 3.949.

13 * 3.949 is approximately 51.337.

0.38205 *3.949 ≈ around 1.509.

So total is approximately 52.846 fm.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B) 355.351 fm, C) 177.675 fm, D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, none of these are close to 52.846. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units in calculating k.

Let me double-check the calculation of k.

So, the energy E is 50 MeV. The rest mass energy is m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

(p c) = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ≈ sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV.

So p c ≈50 MeV → p = (50 MeV) / c → p = 50 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV /c) / ħ.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So, k = [50 MeV / c ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm)/c ] = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) * (c/c) → c cancels, so k = 50/(197.33) fm⁻¹ → which is approximately 0.2533 fm⁻¹. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but when I compute Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

The sum is 13.38205.

(1/k) = 3.949 fm.

13.38205 * 3.949 ≈ 52.85 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds or tens of thousands. Wait, this suggests I made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f is in units of fm, but maybe I should be considering the imaginary part to be multiplied by something else.

Wait, wait, another thought. I think the formula for the differential cross-section is |f(θ)|². But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the scattering amplitude f is given in units of length, which would be inverse momentum units. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the sum I got was approximately 13.38, and when multiplied by 3.949, I get 52.85 fm.

But the options are in the order of ~177-87000 fm. So that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recalculate k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for k. Let's see. The correct expression for k would be k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ, assuming non-relativistic, but earlier I used the relativistic approach.

Wait, wait, but the problem states the electrons are 50 MeV, which is way above the rest mass, so relativistic. So that approach was correct.

But let me check the calculation again.

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV)/c.

k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ).

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm)/c ) ] = (50 MeV) * c / (197.33 MeV fm) * (1/c) ) → Wait, no, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, substituting:

k = (p) / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )

So,

k = [50 MeV/c ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ] → The c in numerator and denominator cancel.

So,

k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → MeV cancels.

So,

k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹ → which is correct.

So k is 0.2533 per fm.

Then, 1/k ≈ 3.949 fm.

So, the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l is 13.38205.

13.38205 * 3.949 ≈ 52.85 fm.

So the imaginary part is 52.85 fm, but the options don't have this. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the sum is over l=0 to l=4, but maybe the phase shifts given are in radians instead of degrees. Oh wait! Oh, right! When I calculated sin δ_l, I used degrees, but in reality, all calculations should be in radians.

Oh wait, that would change everything. I didn't convert degrees to radians before taking the sine. Oh, that's a big mistake.

So, I need to recalculate the sum using δ in radians.

Let me correct this.

Compute each (2l+1) sin δ_l, where δ is in radians.

So, convert each δ from degrees to radians.

δ0=90° → π/2 ≈1.5708 radians.

sin(δ0)=1.

δ1=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians.

sin(67°) ≈0.9205.

Wait, no, wait, in radians, 67 degrees is about 1.16937 radians.

So,

l=0: 1 * sin(90°)=1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67°)=3 * 0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55°). 55 degrees is 0.95993 radians. sin(55)≈0.8192.

So 5 * 0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30°). 30 degrees is 0.5236 radians. sin(30)=0.5. 7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°). 13 degrees is about 0.2269 radians. sin(13°)=0.22495.

9 * 0.22495= 2.02455.

So, sum is same as before:1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.38205.

Wait, but that's the same sum. Because sin(67°) is same as sin(1.16937 radians), etc. Oh wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, my mistake was that I perhaps thought that using degrees instead of radians would change the sine, but in reality, when I calculated the sine earlier, I did it correctly in degrees. Because in the first calculation, I used degrees, but actually, for calculations, I should have converted to radians before taking sine.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine. In the initial calculation, I used degrees for the sine function. But that's incorrect because in programming, for example, the sine function expects radians. So in actual calculation, I should have converted each δ to radians before taking sine.

So, let me recalculate the sum with correct sine values.

Wait, earlier I thought that I had used the correct values. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps that's not the issue here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is that I'm getting 52.85 fm, but the options are much larger. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section.

Wait, the differential cross-section is given by dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|².

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section.

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = sum_l ( (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ) ) / (k) )

The imaginary part is Im(f(θ)).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum_l (2l+1) Im( e^{i δ_l} -1 )

As before.

Im( e^{i δ_l} -1 ) = sin δ_l.

So, same as before.

Hmm, but the calculation leads to Im(f(0)) ≈52.85 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I messed up the calculation of k.

Wait another thought: Maybe the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ, in non-relativistic terms.

Wait, but for 50 MeV electrons, which is much higher than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), the non-relativistic approach is not valid. So perhaps I should compute it using relativistic terms.

Wait, but earlier I did that.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using the non-relativistic formula, just to see.

In non-relativistic case, E = p²/(2m).

So, p = sqrt(2 m E).

Then, k = p/ħ = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

But m is the electron mass, which is 0.511 MeV/c². So E is 50 MeV.

But 2mE = 2 * 0.511 MeV * 50 MeV = 51.1 MeV².

So sqrt(51.1 MeV²) = sqrt(51.1) MeV ≈7.15 MeV.

So p =7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/ħ = (7.15 MeV/c ) / ħ.

Again, using ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

So,

k = (7.15 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = (7.15 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm ) ) → which is 7.15 / 197.33 ≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but this is a much smaller k than the relativistic approach. So, 1/k ≈27.61 fm.

So, sum is 13.38205 → 13.38205 *27.61 ≈369.3 fm.

Hmm, that's closer to option B (355.351) or C (177.675). But 369 is still off.

But wait, I think this approach is incorrect because the non-relativistic formula isn't applicable at 50 MeV. So perhaps the correct approach is the relativistic one.

So, in the relativistic case, I get Im(f(0))≈52.85 fm, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recalculate the sum.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. For example, perhaps the formula for f includes a factor of (1/(2l+1)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the unit conversion again.

Wait, the options are in fm, but perhaps I should be using the correct unit conversion for k.

Wait, another way to compute k is:

k = (p) / ħ = (50 MeV/c ) / (ħ )

We know ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / (c )

So,

k = (50 MeV/c ) / ( (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ) ) → c cancels.

So,

k = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → MeV cancels.

k = 50 / 197.33 ≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k ≈3.949 fm.

So, sum is 13.38205 → 13.38205 * 3.949 ≈52.85 fm.

Wait, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(θ) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / k.

But wait, another way: The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l } -1 ] P_l(cosθ) ) / (k )

So, Im(f(θ)) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ) / k.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So,

Im(f(0)) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / k.

So,

sum = 1*(1) +3*(sin67°) +5*(sin55°)+7*(sin30°)+9*(sin13°)

Wait, let's compute each term accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(90°)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°)=3 * 0.920504 → 2.761512.

l=2:5 * sin(55°)=5 * 0.819152 →4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin(30°)=7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°)=9 * 0.224951 →2.02456.

Sum: 1 + 2.761512 =3.761512 +4.09576=7.857272 +3.5=11.357272 +2.02456=13.381832.

So sum is 13.381832.

Multiply by 1/k=3.949 fm → 13.381832 *3.949 ≈52.841 fm.

Hmm, so same result as before. So that's about 52.84 fm.

But the options are way off. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula for the amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ) )

But perhaps the amplitude is in units of 1/(fm) because 1/k is in fm, and the sum is dimensionless.

Wait, but the options are in fm. So the imaginary part being around 50 fm would make sense if, for example, the amplitude is in 1/fm.

But wait, the problem states to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Scattering amplitude f has units of length (fm?), since cross-section is in barns (10^-24 cm²), and σ = |f|^2 (in units where ħ c=1, etc.)

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the phase shifts are given in radians, so the sin δ_l is different.

Wait, let me compute the sum again, but this time using the actual radians.

Wait, for example:

l=0: δ0=90°=pi/2 radians. sin(pi/2)=1.

l=1: δ1=67 degrees →67*pi/180≈1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937)=approx 0.9205.

l=2:55 degrees →55*pi/180≈0.95993 radians. sin(0.95993)= approx 0.8192.

l=3:30 degrees=pi/6≈0.5236 radians. sin(pi/6)=0.5.

l=4:13 degrees→13*pi/180≈0.22689 radians. sin(0.22689)=approx 0.22495.

So the sum is same as before: 1 + 2.7615 +4.09576+3.5 +2.02456 =13.38183.

Wait, so no difference. So same result.

So, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1)/(2k) ) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check: the standard expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) / (k) ) * (e^{i δ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ).

So, the factor is (2l+1)/(k) times (e^{i δ} -1) times P_l.

Yes, that's right.

So, I think the calculation is correct, but perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the imaginary part is the sum of the imaginary parts of f for each partial wave, but perhaps each term is (2l+1)/(k) * sin(delta_l) * P_l(1). Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the phase shifts are given for l=0 to l=4, but perhaps considering the sum until l=4 (including l=4) is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in units of 1/(fm) differently.

Wait, let me compute k in terms of the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength for an electron is λ_c = ħ/(m c) ≈ 2.426 ×10^−12 m ≈ 2.426 fm.

Wait, but for E=50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass energy, the wavelength λ is given by λ = h / (p c) * c → Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of relativistic energy.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma m c². Momentum p = gamma m v, where v is the velocity. So p c = gamma m c v.

But for high energies, v approaches c, so p c ≈ E.

So, p ≈ E/(c) → because E≈p c.

Then, k = p / ħ = (E/(c)) / (ħ) → E in MeV, c in units where ħ c ≈197 MeV fm.

Wait, so E =50 MeV.

k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c ) → MeV cancels, c cancels, so k=50/(197.33) ≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Which brings me back to the same value.

So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, or I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the amplitude is f= (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ), and the options are in units of fm.

So, if sum=13.38205, and 1/k≈3.949 fm, then 13.38205 *3.949≈52.85 fm.

But none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the differential cross-section and then find the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So, in the direction of the incident beam, which is θ=0°, but perhaps it's the backward direction, θ=180°, which is the same as θ=pi radians.

Wait, no, because in scattering, θ=0 is the direction of the incident beam, and θ=pi is the opposite direction.

Wait, but for the Legendre polynomials, P_l(-x) = (-1)^l P_l(x).

So, perhaps when θ=pi, cosθ =-1. So,

f(pi) = sum ( (2l+1)/(k) (e^{i δ_l} -1) P_l(-1) )

But P_l(-1) = (-1)^l.

So,

f(pi) = sum ( (2l+1)/(k) (e^{i δ_l} -1) (-1)^l )

But the question was about the incident beam direction, which is θ=0.

Hmm, this isn't helping.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of f(0), which is what I've been calculating, but perhaps the options are wrong, or I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but when I calculated sin, I treated them as degrees. Let me recalculate the sum.

Wait, no, because in the earlier calculation, I correctly converted degrees to radians before taking the sine. So, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the sum without l=0. Because for elastic scattering, l=0 may not contribute. But in the given phase shifts, l=0 is included.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum with δ in radians.

Wait, but the given phase shifts are in degrees. So, I think I did this correctly.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the calculation should have used the sum of the squares, but no, the problem is about the imaginary part, not the magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the phase shifts are given. For example, perhaps the phase shifts are to be interpreted as in the Born approximation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum without the factor (1/k).

Wait, sum is 13.38205, so 13.38205 * 3.949≈52.85 fm.

But the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(90°)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67°) =3 * 0.9205043=2.7615129.

l=2:5 * sin(55°)=5 * 0.819152044=4.09576022.

l=3:7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°)=9 * 0.224951054=2.024559486.

Summing them up:

1 + 2.7615129 =3.7615129.

+4.09576022 →7.85727312.

+3.5 →11.35727312.

+2.024559486 →13.3818326.

So sum is 13.3818326.

Then, 1/k is 1/0.2533 ≈3.949 fm.

So,

13.3818326 *3.949 ≈ ?

Let me compute 13.3818326 * 3.949:

13 *3.949 =51.337.

0.3818326 *3.949 ≈1.509.

So total ≈52.846 fm.

Hmm, which is about 52.85 fm.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (2), or perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, I'm trying to think if I forgot a factor somewhere. Let me re-examine the formula for f(θ).

Wait, in some references, the scattering amplitude is written as:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ).

So the formula is correct.

Another idea: Perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of π, but the problem gives them in degrees. So, perhaps I should have converted them to radians by multiplying by π/180.

Wait, which I did earlier. So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the non-relativistic approach, but that gives a sum of about 369 fm, which is still not matching.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at option C:177.675 fm.

Hmm, 177.675 is approximately 52.85 * 3.363.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach to compute k:

k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

E=50 MeV.

m=electron mass=0.511 MeV c².

So,

2mE = 2 *0.511 MeV *50 MeV=51.1 MeV^2.

sqrt(51.1) =7.15 MeV.

So,

k =7.15 MeV/(ħ c) *c → because ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k =7.15 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 7.15/197.33 ≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k ≈27.61 fm.

Then, sum=13.3818326 → 13.3818326 *27.61≈369 fm.

But option B is 355.351 fm, which is close.

But this would require using the non-relativistic approach, which is incorrect for 50 MeV electrons.

Hmm, but perhaps this is the intended approach, leading to option B.

But earlier I thought the correct approach was relativistic, but perhaps the problem expects non-relativistic.

So, using non-relativistic approach:

Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k).

k=0.0362 fm⁻¹ →1/k=27.61 fm.

sum=13.3818326 → 13.3818 *27.61 ≈368.7 fm.

Which is close to option B (355.351).

But option B is 355.351, which is a bit less than 368.7.

Hmm, perhaps the error comes from more precise calculation.

Let me compute 50/(197.33) exactly.

50 /197.33 = ?

Let me compute:

197.33 ×0.2533 = 50? Let me compute 0.2533 *197.33.

0.25 *197.33=49.3325.

0.0033 *197.33 ≈0.651189.

Total ≈49.3325 +0.651189≈49.983689, which is close to 50. So, k=0.2533 fm⁻¹ is correct.

So, using that, Im(f(0))=52.85 fm.

But without this being an option, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l +1) * (1 - cos δ_l ), but that's the real part, not the imaginary.

Wait, no, the imaginary part is sin δ_l.

Another thought: Perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ) )

Thus, Im(f)= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) /k.

But perhaps the problem expects the sum multiplied by 2, because sometimes the amplitude includes a factor of 2.

Wait, but I don't think so. The formula I have doesn't include a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given as in the Born approximation, but that shouldn't affect the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the sum with more precise sine values.

Compute each term with more precise sine values:

l=0: sin(90°)=1.

l=1: sin(67°)= sin(67 * pi/180)=sin(1.16937056 radians)= approx 0.92050433.

So, 3 *0.92050433=2.76151299.

l=2: sin(55°)= sin(55 * pi/180)=sin(0.95993108 radians)= approx 0.81915204.

5 *0.81915204=4.0957602.

l=3: sin(30°)=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: sin(13°)=sin(13 * pi/180)=sin(0.2268928 radians)= approx 0.22495105.

9 *0.22495105=2.02455945.

Sum:1 +2.76151299 +4.0957602 +3.5 +2.02455945.

Compute step by step:

1 +2.76151299 =3.76151299.

+4.0957602 →7.85727319.

+3.5 →11.35727319.

+2.02455945 →13.38183264.

So, sum is 13.38183264.

Multiply by 1/k=3.949 fm → 13.38183264 *3.949 = ?

Let me compute this accurately:

3.949 ×13.38183264.

Compute 3.949 ×13 =51.337.

3.949 ×0.38183264 =

0.38183264 ×3 =1.14549792.

0.38183264 ×0.949 = let's compute 0.38183264 *0.9 =0.343649376, 0.38183264 *0.049=approx 0.0187098. Total≈0.343649376 +0.0187098≈0.362359176.

So total for 0.38183264 ×3.949 is 1.14549792 +0.362359176 ≈1.507857.

So total sum is 51.337 +1.507857 ≈52.844857 fm.

Hmm, still around 52.84 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but we should compute sin in degrees, which would be incorrect. Let me see what happens if I calculate the sines in degrees.

Compute the sines as degrees, not radians.

l=0: sin(90)=1.

l=1: sin(67)=0.9205.

l=2: sin(55)=0.8192.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5.

l=4: sin(13)=0.22495.

So the same sum applies, 13.38183.

Hmm, same result.

Thus, I'm confident that my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem interpretation.

Wait, another idea: The question says "Ignore rest of the phase shifts." Does that mean that higher l beyond 4 are zero? So, perhaps other l's contribute, but the question says to ignore them, so only up to l=4 is considered. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given that none of the options are close, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ) ) / (k)

But perhaps the factor is (1/(2k)) sum ( ... ), which would reduce the sum by a factor of 2.

Then, Im(f(0)) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k)

So, 13.38183264 / (2 * 0.2533) →13.38183264 /0.5066 ≈26.417 fm.

But that's still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (1/(k)) sum ( (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) ) / (2l+1) ), but that would cancel out.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the real part, but no, the question asks for the imaginary part.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the answer is option D:251.271 fm.

Wait, 251.271 / 52.85 is about 4.74, which is close to pi/2*3=4.712. But I don't see the relevance.

Another Idea: Perhaps the sum is multiplied by 2, giving 105.70 fm. No, no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be multiplied by (ħ c) instead of 1/k.

Because, 1/k = ħ c / (50 MeV) → which would bring units into fm.

Wait, let me compute:

sum * ( ħ c / E )

Where E=50 MeV, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

sum * (197.33 /50) =13.3818 *3.9466≈13.3818 *3.9466≈52.81 fm.

Which brings us back to the same result.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2k)) sum ( ... )

Which would make Im(f) = sum ( ... ) / (2k).

So 13.3818 / (2 * 0.2533) →13.3818/0.5066≈26.417 fm.

Still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum ( (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l / (k ) )

But perhaps I forgot to multiply by i, but the imaginary part would be the same.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in units of 10^3 fm or something, but the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, and I should have used them as such without converting to degrees.

Wait, if the phase shifts are in radians, then:

l=0: 90 radians is a huge angle, which doesn't make sense. So no, that can't be.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units of pi radians, but that's unlikely.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Since the calculation gives around 52.85 fm and the closest option is not present, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm, which is approximately 52.85 *4.74. But I don't see why.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l +1) multiplied by the imaginary part of (e^{i δ_l} -1), which is sin δ_l, and then multiplied by (1/k), as I did.

But perhaps I forgot to consider that the scattering amplitude is in the Born approximation, which would include a factor of 1/(k), but I think I accounted for that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave number k was computed incorrectly. Let me compute it again.

Given E=50 MeV.

Using the relativistic formula:

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So, p c= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=sqrt(2500-0.261)=sqrt(2499.739)=approx 49.9974 MeV.

p=49.9974 MeV/c.

k= p / ħ = (49.9974 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm /c )

→ MeV cancels, c cancels.

k=49.9974 / 197.33 ≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k ≈3.949 fm.

This seems correct.

Another Idea: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum ( (2l +1)/(2k) ) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ).

In that case, the sum would be multiplied by (1/(2k)).

So, Im(f(0)) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k).

Which would be 13.38183 / (2 *0.2533) =13.38183 /0.5066≈26.417 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (1/k) for each term, but I think that's what I did.

Hmm.

After trying all possible avenues, I think the correct answer based on my calculation is approximately 52.85 fm, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct approach was different.

But the options given don't include this, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, another Idea: The problem states "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target." Perhaps the electrons are treated as particles with kinetic energy 50 MeV, not total energy. So, perhaps I should compute their momentum using the non-relativistic formula.

Kinetic energy KE = (p^2)/(2m).

So, p^2 = 2 m KE.

m=electron mass=9.109e-31 kg.

KE=50 MeV =50e6 *1.602e-13 J =8.01e-7 J.

So,

p^2=2*9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-7 J.

p^2=  2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-7 = approx 1.459e-37.

p= sqrt(1.459e-37)≈ 1.208e-18 kg m/s.

So, k=p/ħ.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

k=1.208e-18 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈1.145e+16 m⁻¹.

Convert to fm⁻¹: 1 m =1e15 fm.

So,

k=1.145e16 m⁻¹ =1.145e16 /1e15 fm⁻¹=11.45 fm⁻¹.

So, 1/k≈0.0872 fm.

Then, Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k )

sum=13.38183 →13.38183 * 0.0872 → approx 1.169 fm.

But this is even further from the options.

This approach must be incorrect, as the kinetic energy of 50 MeV is way beyond the non-relativistic limit.

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct, leading to 52.85 fm, but none of the options match.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 3.36 times larger than my result.

But I can't see a way to get to that number.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the formula. Let me check.

If I include a factor of 2 in the sum, the sum becomes 26.76366, multiplied by 1/k=3.949 →26.76366 *3.949≈105.7 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied by 2k instead of 1/k.

Wait, that would be 13.38 * 0.2533 ≈3.383 fm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be multiplied by (k), but that would give 13.38 *0.2533≈3.383 fm.

No.

Hmm.

After trying all these possibilities and not finding a match, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm.

But I can't see how to get there.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the wave number k is actually (197.33 MeV fm) / (50 MeV) → which is 3.9466 fm.

So, 1/k≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

So, sum * (1/k) →13.38 *0.2533 ≈3.383 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/k) * (ħ c) ) → but units would be in fm^2.

Not sure.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a match. Perhaps the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm, but I'm not sure how to reach it.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Let me compute the sum again with phase shifts in radians.

Wait, but the given phase shifts are in degrees. So I think this is not the case.

Another Idea: Perhaps the sum considers only even or odd l values. Let's see.

But the problem includes l=0,1,2,3,4, so I think that's not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sum is multiplied by (k) instead of (1/k).

So, 13.38 *0.2533 →3.383 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is divided by k, which would be 13.38 /0.2533 ≈52.85 fm.

Which brings me back to the same result.

Another Idea: Perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of 10^(-15) meters (femtometers), but my calculation is correct, so perhaps the options are wrong.

But since the options don't match, perhaps I should go with option C:177.675 fm.

But without further insight, I can't find a way to reach any of the options.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The scattering amplitude is expressed as:

\[
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \left(e^{i \delta_l} - 1\right) P_l(\cos\theta),
\]

where \(k\) is the wave number, \(\delta_l\) are the phase shifts, and \(P_l(\cos\theta)\) are the Legendre polynomials. Along the incident beam direction (\(\theta = 0\)), \(P_l(\cos 0) = 1\), so the imaginary part of \(f(0)\) simplifies to:

\[
\text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin\delta_l.
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number Calculation**:  
   The wave number \(k\) is related to the momentum \(p\) by \(k = p / \hbar\). Using the relativistic energy relation \(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\), the momentum is approximated as \(p \approx E/c\) for high-energy electrons. Substituting \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}\), the wave number is calculated as:
   \[
   k = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.2533 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Sum of Terms**:  
   The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ\). Converting these to radians and computing \(\sin\delta_l\) for each \(l\), the terms \((2l+1)\sin\delta_l\) are:
   - \(l=0\): \(1 \cdot \sin(90^\circ) = 1\),
   - \(l=1\): \(3 \cdot \sin(67^\circ) \approx 2.7615\),
   - \(l=2\): \(5 \cdot \sin(55^\circ) \approx 4.0958\),
   - \(l=3\): \(7 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 3.5\),
   - \(l=4\): \(9 \cdot \sin(13^\circ) \approx 2.0246\).

   Summing these gives:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin\delta_l \approx 1 + 2.7615 + 4.0958 + 3.5 + 2.0246 = 13.382.
   \]

3. **Imaginary Part of \(f(0)\)**:  
   Substituting into the formula for \(\text{Im}\,f(0)\):
   \[
   \text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin\delta_l = \frac{13.382}{0.2533} \, \text{fm} \approx 52.85 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \(52.85 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options:
   - (A) \(87163.4 \, \text{fm}\),
   - (B) \(355.351 \, \text{fm}\),
   - (C) \(177.675 \, \text{fm}\),
   - (D) \(251.271 \, \text{fm}\).

   After rechecking the calculations and considering potential errors (e.g., relativistic vs. non-relativistic approaches, unit conversions), the closest plausible answer based on the given options is **(C) \(177.675 \, \text{fm}\)**. This discrepancy may arise from differences in interpretation or approximations in the problem setup.

ANSWER: C
