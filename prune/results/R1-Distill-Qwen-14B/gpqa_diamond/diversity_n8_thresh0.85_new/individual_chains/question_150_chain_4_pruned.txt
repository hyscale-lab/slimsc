Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging into the formula: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. Let me compute that. 

2*8 is 16 +2 is 18. 18-9=9, 9-1=8, 8+1=9. 9 divided by 2 is 4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But since there's no X (halogens), it's (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Let me recalculate. 2*8 is 16, plus 2 is 18. 18 minus 9 is 9, plus 1 (for N) is 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which accounts for 4, since each double bond is one) and perhaps a carbonyl group (another double bond) and maybe a ring or a double bond elsewhere. Or maybe some other combination.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H NMR (ppm): 
9.72 (t, 1H) – a triplet around 9.7, which could be an aldehyde proton (but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as singlets or maybe doublets). Wait, but a triplet? Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. Or maybe something else like an enol or something with coupling.

6.98 (d, 2H) – aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. Like two protons in a para position, so maybe two identical substituents on a benzene ring.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another set of aromatic protons, also doublet. So maybe two substituents on the benz
