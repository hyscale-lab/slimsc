Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion at rest decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. 

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, conservation of energy and momentum must be applied. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

So, the key here is that the total energy and momentum are conserved. Let me jot down what I know.

The rest mass of the Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV. The mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? So I can probably treat it as massless. 

The decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. 

Okay, so considering energy and momentum conservation. The energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the neutrino's energy would be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. The muon's energy would be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. 

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV
- m_nu ≈ 0 (so we can ignore it)

So, the initial energy is E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay:
E_final = E_mu + E_nu
E_mu = gamma * m_mu c² = (total energy of muon) = m_mu c² + K_mu
E_nu = p_nu c (since for neutrino, E = pc)
But wait, because momentum must be conserved. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay is zero. So, the momentum of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (
