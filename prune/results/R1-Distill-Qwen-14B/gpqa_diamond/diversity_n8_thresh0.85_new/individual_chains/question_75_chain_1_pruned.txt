Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about why a transgenic mouse model isn't overexpressing the GADD45G protein as expected. The setup is that the researcher introduced a coding sequence with a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. 

The plus strand sequence provided has an ATG start codon, followed by some nucleotides, and ends with a TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, let me look carefully. The sequence starts with 5' ATG ... and ends with ... TGA 3'. So, the HA tag should be at the N-terminus, meaning it's the first part of the protein. 

But why isn't the protein being expressed? The options are about possible issues. Let me go through each option.

Option A: The HA tag has a missense mutation. If the HA sequence is messed up, the protein might not be recognized by antibodies, but the question states that the problem is the lack of overexpression, not detection. So maybe this isn't the main issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. Looking at the sequence, I see that the coding region starts with ATG and ends with TGA. Let me check for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in between. Hmm, the sequence is a long ORF without obvious stop codons. The last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So if the sequence is correct, the ribosome should read through until the end. Unless the construct is designed to have a stop codon earlier, but the question says it's the plus strand, so I think the HA is correctly added. So maybe B is not correct.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If there's no linker between HA and the rest, maybe the protein is being degraded. But the HA is at the N-terminus; proteolysis usually occurs if there are recognition sites for proteases. The question doesn't mention any such sites. Alternatively, perhaps the construct lacks a necessary sequence, like a signal peptide or a cleavage site, causing improper folding or degradation. Or maybe the HA tag is causing it to be recognized by the cell's proteases. I'm not sure about this one.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, looking at the stop codon. The stop codon is TGA, which is recognized by release factors. In the cell used, which is Chinese hamster ovary, the tRNAs should recognize the standard stop codons. The stop codon is TGA, which is a common stop, so the cell should recognize it. So D doesn't make sense because the tRNA for UAA (if it existed) isn't the issue here. The stop is TGA, which doesn't require a tRNA because translation stops.

Wait, another thought. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence starts with ATG, then HA, then GADD45G. So the transcript would have the HA followed by GADD45G. But if the HA isn't followed by the correct start for GADD45G, maybe there's a problem. Wait, no, the HA is part of the same ORF, so the ribosome should start at ATG, read the HA, then the rest of the GADD45G. 

Looking at the sequence again, the first part after ATG is TAC. TAC is tyrosine. Wait, HA is a specific sequence. Let me recall, HA tag is usually a peptide from the influenza virus. The HA tag is a short sequence, like YPYDVPDYA. So the coding sequence for HA would be something like TAC ATC TAC GAT GGT etc. But in the given sequence, the start is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, maybe the HA was inserted incorrectly. Let me parse the beginning.

The
