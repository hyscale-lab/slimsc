Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are mixed. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I need to make sure my units are consistent at the end.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But in this case, there are two acids and a base. Oh right, HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is a strong acid too. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So I guess the reaction here is between the acids and the base.

But wait, how do I approach this when there are two acids? I think I need to find out how much of each acid reacts with the base. The neutralization would involve H+ ions from the acids reacting with OH- ions from the base.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the moles of each acid and the base.

For HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

H2SO4: Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Wait, but sulfuric acid is diprotic. In a strong acid, it donates two H+ ions per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+. So 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2: Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, so the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change is per mole of H+ reacting. But the limiting reagent here is OH- because we have 0.28 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

Each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases a certain amount of energy. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and
