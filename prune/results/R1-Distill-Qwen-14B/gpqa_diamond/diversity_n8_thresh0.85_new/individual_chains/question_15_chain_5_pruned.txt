Okay, so I've got this transit detection question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to detect their transits but have limited time, so they need to pick the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both have been detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same.

Hmm, the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so I need to figure out how the probability depends on various factors.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(a)), but wait, that's not right. Wait, I think the probability is actually highest when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(a)), no, wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think the formula for the transit probability is a bit different. Let me think. Oh right! The transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius in some way? Or more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit seen edge-on compared to some other factor.

Wait, I think the geometric probability of a transit is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2) / ( (a_p / R_s) ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ), but I'm probably mixing things up.

Wait, no, another approach: The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of this alignment is equal to R*/a, where R* is the star
