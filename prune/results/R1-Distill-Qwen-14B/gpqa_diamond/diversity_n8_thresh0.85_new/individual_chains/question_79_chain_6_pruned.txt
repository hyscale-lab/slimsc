Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the resulting NMR spectra. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the reaction: Compound X (C11H12O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? I think it's a commonly used base in organic reactions, like in the Hofmann elimination or maybe some elimination reactions. Oh, and 403 K is pretty hot, so maybe it's an elimination reaction.

So, what kind of reaction would lead to the product observed in the NMR? Hmm. Compound X has the formula C11H12O. Let me think about the possible structures. The options are all oxirane derivatives, which are epoxides. So, the reaction might be an opening of an epoxide ring, but wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base—it could deprotonate something and cause elimination, maybe forming a double bond from an epoxide. Oh wait, no, wait. Another thought: maybe the reaction is an elimination, leading to an epoxide ring opening? Or perhaps the base is causing an E2 elimination, forming a new double bond.

Wait, no—Compound X is being treated with this base. So, if X is an epoxide, maybe the base is causing an ring-opening. Alternatively, if X is a diol, the base could cause elimination to form an epoxide. Hmm, but the product has an epoxide structure, perhaps? Wait, looking at the options, they all have 'oxirane' which is another name for epoxide.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a different kind of reaction. Oh, wait, the product's NMR is given. So, the product is the result of reacting X with this base. Let's think about the product's structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR of the product. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets around 2.2-2.3 ppm, each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Maybe they're attached to an electronegative atom or in a symmetrical environment. Alternatively, maybe they're attached to a carbonyl group or something else that deshields them but doesn't split the signal.

The aromatic region shows a total of six protons. Let's break it down:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, but this adds up to 6H. Maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with some substituents. Let me think about the splitting. The doublets could indicate coupling between adjacent protons on the ring. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, you'd have two doublets for the ortho protons, but wait, that's when there's a substituent in the para position.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to the ring. Let's consider a structure where there's a styryl group (like a benzene ring attached to a double bond). Styryl would have a vinyl group attached to the benzene, so maybe the NMR shows signals from the double bond.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR data for the product:

The carbons are:
21.3 (1C, s) – maybe a CH3 attached to something like an oxygen, like an epoxide?
28.4 (1C, s) – another CH3, maybe attached to a different part. Maybe two methyl groups adjacent to an oxygen.
126.9 (2C, s) – these could be carbons in a double bond or aromatic carbons.
127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s) – these are more in the aromatic or double bond regions.
141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s) – these are likely carbons attached to substituents, maybe a carbonyl or an oxygen.
197.7 (1C, s) – this is a high chemical shift, probably a carbonyl. Wait, but the product's formula isn't given. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide carbon? Because epoxide carbons typically show up around 60-70 ppm in 13C NMR. Wait, 197 is way higher. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a ketone? Or perhaps an ester? Or maybe a carbonyl group attached to something else.

Wait, but the reaction involved 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base. So, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming a double bond. So, maybe Compound X is a diol, and upon treatment with a base, it forms an epoxide. Wait, but the product has an epoxide, so maybe X is an epoxide that undergoes some reaction.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps X is a di-substituted epoxide, and the base causes it to open to form a diene or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to an epoxide, leading to ring opening and forming a double bond. So the product would have a new double bond. Let me think about the NMR.

Looking at the product's NMR: the 1H NMR shows a triplet of doublets or something else, but I'm seeing doublets. So, the aromatic region has two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. Hmm. Let me try to imagine a structure.

Suppose the product is a styrene derivative, with substituents. Like, maybe a benzene ring with a vinyl group attached. Alternatively, perhaps a benzene with two substituents, each having a double bond.

Wait, the 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. Let's think: perhaps it's a structure where two methyl groups are attached to adjacent carbons, like in a propene chain. Wait, or maybe a group like (CH3)2C-O- something.

Wait, if the 13C NMR has a
