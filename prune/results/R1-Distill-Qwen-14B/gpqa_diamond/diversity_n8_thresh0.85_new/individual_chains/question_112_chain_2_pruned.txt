Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The question is about calculating probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So the state is expressed in the z-basis. But first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i) for |up> and |down> respectively.

To normalize, I should calculate the norm of this state. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So, for |up>, the coefficient is (1+i), and its magnitude squared is (1^2 +1^2) = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2 - i), and its magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. That means the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Next part is about another operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is 2x2. Let me write it out. The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm, wait, that's not a diagonal matrix. Oh right, this operator isn't diagonal in the z-basis. So perhaps it's a spin-flip operator or something else. But wait, the spin-x operator has matrix elements like [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] multiplied by sigma_x, which is the Pauli matrix. Or no, wait: the Pauli matrices are usually defined with a factor of sigma times ħ/2. So actually, the operator A in the problem might be proportional to sigma_x. Let me check: the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so A would be (ħ/2) times X. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, so the operator whose eigenstates we need is this A. But the question is about measuring the eigenstates of this operator. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. Let me recall, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/
