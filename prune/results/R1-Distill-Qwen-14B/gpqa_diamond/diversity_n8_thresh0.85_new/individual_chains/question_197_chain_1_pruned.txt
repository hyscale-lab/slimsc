Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe like esters or something else.

First, I need to analyze the spectral data given for Compound X. Let's start with the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe N-H. But the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, 1450, and so on. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group (C=O). Esters, ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids have that. But the 1610 and 1450 peaks might correspond to aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents, possibly an ester group.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first one is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty downfield shift. Aromatic protons usually are around 7-8.5 ppm, but 10.5 is way down, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. But wait, another possibility is an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, but those are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm, but wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12, but sometimes they can be lower if there's hydrogen bonding or something. Wait, but in the IR, if there's a carbonyl around 1720, that could be an ester or a ketone. But wait, another thought: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an aromatic ester or something else.

Wait, let's look at all the NMR signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) probably are two sets of doublets. That could be para-substituted aromatic protons. Like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, two protons would be ortho to one substituent and para to another. So two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggests a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break those down.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. A common scenario is a methyl group attached to a CH that is part of a larger structure, like maybe a branched alkyl chain. For example, if you have a group like -(CH2)-C(CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, another possibility is a geminal di-substitution, but perhaps more likely, it's a CH2CH(CH3) type structure. Let me think about that.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group that's connected to some other groups, maybe a CH that's adjacent to another CH2 or something. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two protons on a CH2 next to a branching point or something like that.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2. Like in an ethyl group: CH2CH3. So the triplet suggests it's split by the neighboring CH2. So maybe the structure has an ethyl chain somewhere.

Putting this together: The aromatic part is para-substituted with two groups. One of the substituents is an aldehyde (based on the 10.5 ppm peak), but wait, could it be a carboxylic acid? Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is about the right region for an ester or a ketone but not a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broader O-H stretch, but the IR here has 3400-2500, which could include an O-H. Wait, but the 1720 is more likely an ester. Hmm.

Wait, the IR also has peaks at 1610 and 1450, which are typical for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents, possibly an ester group.

Wait, another thought: the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. But for an aldehyde, the NMR is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So that fits. But an aldehyde group would have a carbonyl at around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR. So maybe the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with an ester group? Or perhaps an aromatic ketone? Not sure.

Wait, but if it's an aromatic aldehyde, then the substituents on the benzene would be an aldehyde group and another group, perhaps an ester or something else. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid proton. But then the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3000 cm-1 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. Wait, the IR has 1720, which is a bit high for a carboxylic acid (they're usually around 1700). So maybe it's an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1720-1750. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with some substituents.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which could be the aldehyde proton. So maybe the structure is something like 4-ethylbenzaldehyde or similar. But let's see the other substituents.

The aromatic substitution is para, so we have two substituents on opposite positions. Let's say one substituent is an aldehyde (CHO) and the other is an ester group. Or perhaps one substituent is an aldehyde and another is an alkyl chain with an ester.

Wait, but the NMR also shows the 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm signals, which seem to suggest an alkyl chain. For example, maybe the structure is benzaldehyde with a substituent that is an ester group, like OCO-R.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and a side chain that ends in an ester. Let me think about that.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again. The 10.5 is 1H, which is likely the aldehyde. Then, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, so perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with an aldehyde and another group. The other substituent could be a propyl group or something branched.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group, like in a CH2CH2 chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to a branching point, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

So perhaps the structure is something like this: benzaldehyde with a propyl chain attached, but with branching. Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a pentyl group or a butyl group with branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: 0.9
