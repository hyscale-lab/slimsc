Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant (K) tells us about the stability of that complex.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is for the reaction where EDTA and Ca²+ combine to form the complex. The formula for K is [Ca-EDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Oh right, because the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−.

Since the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex. Let me denote this as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. 

I think I can set up an equilibrium expression using K. So,

K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5x10^10.

But wait, what about the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−? Let me think. In the solution, the total EDTA comes from both the free EDTA and the complex. But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA, and assuming that the initial EDTA is all in the form of the complex, maybe the free EDTA is very low because K is large, meaning the complex is stable.

Wait, but in reality, EDTA is usually present in solution as the conjugate base. Oh wait, the pH is ideal, so maybe the solution is such that EDTA is in the Y^4- form, which is the deprotonated form required for complexation. So I can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4− is approximately equal to the total EDTA minus the amount bound in the complex. Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the initial EDTA concentration is 0.02 M (since the stoichiometry is 1:1), then perhaps the free EDTA is very small compared to the total.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the K expression. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− would be y. But since the complex is 0.02 M, the product of x and y should be [CaEDTA²−]/K.

So, K = 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y).

But wait, because the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. Let's think about the total EDTA. The total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA^4− and the EDTA bound in the complex. Let me denote the total EDTA concentration as C_EDTA. Similarly, the concentration of Ca²+ is the sum of free Ca²+ and the Ca in the complex
