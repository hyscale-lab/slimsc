Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, I've got a chemistry problem here, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the reactions described. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that they are part of molecular symmetry and group theory, which relates to how molecules look and their symmetries.

First, let's break down the reactions step by step. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Lastly, gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I need to figure out what each of these chemicals could be. Let me start with the reactions. The first reaction has A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and used in large amounts, maybe B is something like O2 or another diatomic gas. Also, 8 equivalents suggests that B is a diatomic molecule because 4 molecules would give 8 atoms. Wait, but wait, no, because 8 equivalents would relate stoichiometrically. Maybe if B is O2, each molecule has two atoms, so 8 equivalents would be 8 moles, maybe each reacting with A.

C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? I'm thinking maybe something like Fe(OH)3, but that's a solid. Or perhaps a transition metal complex. Oh, wait, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but chromium(VI) compounds can be orange or red. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide or another colored compound.

Wait, another thought: when a solid reacts with O2 to form a red product, perhaps it's a metal oxide. Wait, maybe it's a sulfur compound? Alternatively, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with gas D to form E. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include things like H2O, alcohols, maybe ethers. H is a solvent, so perhaps H is H2O or something like ethanol.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. So if B is O2, then D might be something that reacts with O2 in 1:1. For example, if B is O2, D could be H2 (since 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O), but that's a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe D is another diatomic gas. Wait, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is O2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to give back A and two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like CH3COOH or H3PO4. So perhaps when C reacts with water, it's undergoing hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is a sulfide or a nitride. Or perhaps C is a metal oxide or sulfide.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: A reacts with 8 B to make C. Let's consider the possibility that B is O2. If A is, say, a metal, like Fe. Then Fe + O2 → FeO? But wait, FeO is actually not very stable; it tends to form Fe3O4 when heated in O2. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. But sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3, but that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents part.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state when reacting with O2. Let's think. Suppose A is Fe. 8 moles of O2 would require Fe to have a high oxidation state. Wait, maybe it's forming FeO4^2- or something similar? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide with O2 in a 4:3 ratio, like Fe3O4. Wait, but 8 equivalents would imply 8 O2 molecules reacting per A. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps A is something else. Let me think about the C reacting with water. If C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water would form a metal hydroxide and possibly an acid. Wait, but the products are F and G, two acids. So, maybe C is a sulfide or a compound that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a nitride. For example, maybe A is a metal nitride. But wait, nitrides reacting with water give NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide. Not sure that fits.

Wait, perhaps C is a dichromate. Chromium(VI) compounds are often orange or red. So Cr2O7^2- is orange-red. So if C is a dichromate salt, like K2Cr2O7, which is bright orange. But the question says bright red, which is a bit different. Hmm.

Alternatively, could C be a permanganate? KMnO4 is
