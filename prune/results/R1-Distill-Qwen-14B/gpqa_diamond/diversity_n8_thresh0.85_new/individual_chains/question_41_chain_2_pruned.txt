Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The problem states that a light beam is moving through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh wait, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, right. The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the medium (glass) is c/n, but that's when the medium is stationary, I think. But here, the glass is moving, so maybe I have to consider relativistic effects?

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about velocities approaching the speed of light, so perhaps it's non-relativistic? Or maybe it's using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Hmmm. Let me think. When dealing with velocities in different frames, if the medium is moving, the speed of light as observed might change. 

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. So the light beam is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, no. The glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving towards the observer, same as the light.

Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Wait, let me re-read. "The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass is moving towards the observer. That is, the beam is moving toward the observer as well, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beamâ€”wait, that might not make sense. Because if the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam, then the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, same as the beam's direction.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize this. Let me imagine the setup. The lab frame has the observer. The glass is moving in a certain direction. The light beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n (since in the glass, the speed is c divided by the index of refraction). But since the glass is moving, we need to find the speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. Oh wait, no. The speed of light in the glass is c/n when the glass is at rest. But when the glass is moving, the observed speed might change because of the motion of the medium.

Wait, but according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But here, the light is in a medium, not a vacuum. So the speed in the medium depends on the frame.

Hmm, so the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the
