Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

First, I need to remember what parallax is. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star relative to more distant background stars, right? The closer the star, the larger the parallax angle. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs, or something like that. So if a star is at distance d (in parsecs), then plx p = 1/d. So d = 1/p.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their actual distances are uniformly spread out in space. But wait, no, wait. Uniform distribution here probably refers to the density of stars. Oh, wait, the problem says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, does that mean their distances are uniformly distributed, or their positions on the celestial sphere? I think it's the latter—so their spatial density is uniform. So like, the number of stars in a certain volume doesn't depend on where you look in the sky.

So, the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd, right? So if the number density of stars is n (number per unit volume
