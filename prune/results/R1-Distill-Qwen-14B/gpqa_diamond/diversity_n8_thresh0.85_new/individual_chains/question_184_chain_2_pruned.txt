Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of steps, and I need to pick the right one. 

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The structure has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 each have substituents. That means the substituents are meta to each other in a way. Wait, no—position 1 is adjacent to 2 and opposite to 3. Let me think about the numbering again. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a way that 1 is next to 2, which is next to 3, making them a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So, the substituents would be in a sort of meta arrangement but all adjacent in a row.

But wait, wait. Let me imagine the benzene ring: if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, it's actually a 1,2,3-trisubstituted structure. So, they're all next to each other. That might mean that the substituents are ortho to each other in a way. Hmm, but in any case, the key point is that all three substituents are present on the benzene ring.

Now, the substituents are an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), a tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3), and a nitro group (NO2). I need to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced because the order of substitution matters in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, as each substituent can direct the incoming group to a particular position.

Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups on the ring. Activating groups (like -OCH2CH3, which is an electron-donating group) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like NO2, which is a strong meta director) can change the reactivity and the positions where new groups add.

Wait, but wait—introducing nitro groups is a deactivating, meta-directing step. Introducing ethoxy is activating and ortho/para. So, the problem is going to be about the order in which these groups are added because each step affects where the next substituent goes.

So, the target molecule has three substituents. Let me think about how to add them. Let's list the substituents again: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), nitro (NO2). 

I think the key is to determine the order of addition. The main thing is to determine which substituents are added first, second, and third, considering their directing effects.

One approach is to plan the synthesis in such a way that each new substituent is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But wait,
