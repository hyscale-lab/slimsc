Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the resulting product's NMR spectra were taken. We need to identify compound X from the given options.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent, right? Oh, right, it's used in the formation of epoxides via the Sharpless epoxidation. Or wait, maybe it's more about ring-opening epoxides? Hmm, no, Sharpless uses other reagents. Wait, Sharpless epoxidation uses a titanium-based catalyst with other components like a peracid. Or maybe this is about opening epoxides in ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU. Oh no, wait, DBU is 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation. Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Let me think about what reactions this reagent is involved in. Oh, another thought: DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. But wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane – perhaps it's used in the formation of epoxides. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an epoxide ring-opening reaction. Hmm.

But the product's NMR is given. Let's look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has signals:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), then some aromatic signals. Let me list them:

- 2.28: singlet, 3H. Maybe a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Like a methyl ester or attached to an electronegative atom, but more likely, perhaps a methyl adjacent to an electronegative group or in a symmetric environment. Alternatively, a methyl attached to an oxygen, like a methoxy group, but methoxy protons are usually around 3.3-3.7, so that's probably not it. Wait, but 2.28 is a singlet. So maybe a methyl group attached to a carbonyl or something, or a quaternary carbon.

Similarly, 2.31 (3H, s). That's another singlet. So perhaps two methyl groups. Could they be adjacent to each other, like geminal di-substitution?

Then the aromatic region:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, that's four different groups. Let me think about a coupling pattern.

Looking at the aromatic signals, the integration suggests four protons from two doublets. Wait, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So that's 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 protons. But wait, the compound's formula is C11H12O. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. 

For C11H12O: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=0. So (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24 -12)/2= 12/2=6. So 6 DoU. So, that would be, for example, a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus two double bonds or rings. Wait, benzene is three DoU. So if there's an epoxide (which is a three-membered ring with two double bonds, so that's one ring and one double bond? Wait, no. Epoxide is a three-membered cyclic ether with one double bond. So each epoxide contributes one DoU (since it's a ring plus a double bond). Wait, no: each ring or double bond is a DoU. So a benzene ring is three DoU (three double bonds). An epoxide has one ring and one double bond, so two DoU. So if the molecule has a benzene ring (3) and an epoxide (2), that's 5 DoU. But the formula has 6 DoU, so there's another one. So maybe a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a substituted benzene and an epoxide, and another double bond somewhere else. So, for example, a styryl group (which is a vinyl group attached to benzene) would contribute another double bond.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

13C NMR: δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, the 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl? Or maybe an epoxide carbon? Wait, no, epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm. Hmm, but wait, 197.7 is a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but the product is the result of reacting compound X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Hmm, so what reaction forms a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide. Oh wait, but DBU is a strong base, so maybe it's a base-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, another approach. Let me look at the options and see if that helps.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all of these options are oxirane (epoxide) derivatives with styryl groups or substituents. So compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction with DBU (or whatever the reagent is) maybe does something to it.

Wait, no, the given data is of the product after reaction with that reagent. So the product is formed from the reaction between X and DBU. So what reaction occurs between an epoxide and DBU?

Wait, DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used as a base in reactions that require deprotonation, like in E2 eliminations, or in some ring-opening reactions. But for an epoxide, under basic conditions, the ring can open. Epoxides can undergo nucleophilic ring-opening under basic conditions, but if there's no strong nucleophile, maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is opened by DBU in a way that forms a ketone or another carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think. If the epoxide ring opens and forms a carbonyl, what would that look like? For example, if an epoxide is subjected to strong base, perhaps it could undergo a ring-opening elimination, forming a carbonyl group. For instance, in the case of a vicinal diol, but that's under acidic conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is opened by a base, but without a strong nucleophile, maybe the ring opens to form a carbonyl via some elimination. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the 13C NMR data, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. That suggests that the product has a ketone or aldehyde group. So perhaps the epoxide in X was opened, and the product has a carbonyl.

Wait, the product has a carbonyl. So the reaction of X with DBU must have transformed the epoxide into a carbonyl group.

But how? Maybe it's a ring-opening followed by elimination. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would be an epoxide (oxirane) where one of the oxygen atoms is attached to a styryl group at the 2 position. The styryl group is a benzene ring with a double bond (CH2-CH2-Ph?), but styry
