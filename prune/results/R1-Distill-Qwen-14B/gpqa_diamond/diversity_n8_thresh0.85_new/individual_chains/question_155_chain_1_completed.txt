Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

Wait, but wait. Since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, I wonder if that affects anything. Oh, right. If the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, then the expectation values of P_x should just be the eigenvalue. But we're interested in P_z here, so maybe the expectation values of P_z can be calculated directly using the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So this must be the state vector |ψ⟩. 

The operator P_z is given as a diagonal matrix with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ) on the diagonal. So P_z is diagonal, which means its eigenstates are the basis vectors of the system. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state |ψ⟩ is expressed in that basis.

To find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, maybe this is straightforward. Let's write out the components. 

The state vector ψ has components (a, b, c) = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So ψ† is the conjugate transpose, but since all components are real, it's just the transpose. 

So ⟨P_z⟩ = a* * P_z_11 * a + b* * P_z_22 * b + c* * P_z_33 * c? Wait, no, wait. Actually, because P_z is diagonal, when you multiply ψ† P_z ψ, each term is the product of the components squared times the corresponding diagonal element. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ) 

Wait wait, that can't be right because the middle term is zero. Let's compute each part:

First term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

Second term: ( (1/√2) )^2 * 0 = 0.

Third term: ( (-1/2) )^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = - ħ/4.

So adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? The operator P_z squared would just be the square of each diagonal element, so the matrix would be (ħ^2, 0, (ħ)^2). Because (P_z)^2 has diagonal entries (ħ^2, 0, ( - ħ)^2 ) = (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is calculated as [ (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ] + [ (1/√2)^2 * 0 ] + [ (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ].

Let's compute each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Second term: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Adding them up: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (ħ²)/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because the state is given, and the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation values should be straightforward. Oh, but wait, the state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me ensure that this is a normalized state. The sum of squares should be 1.

Calculating normalization: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2.

That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, normalized. Good.

So, the calculations seem correct. So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2). Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), so the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with elements $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Breaking this down:
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar = \frac{1}{4} \hbar$.
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = -\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.

Adding these together:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with elements $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Breaking this down:
- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.

Adding these together:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:
- $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$.
- $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
