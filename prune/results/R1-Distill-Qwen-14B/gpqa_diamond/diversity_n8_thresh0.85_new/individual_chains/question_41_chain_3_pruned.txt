Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light. So, the light is moving through the glass, and the glass is itself moving. I remember that when a medium is moving, things get a bit tricky because of relativity effects, but maybe I can use the relativistic velocity addition formula here.

Oh wait, but we're dealing with the speed of light. Because light's speed is c in a vacuum, but inside a medium, it's slower. Right, the speed of light in the medium is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium. Now, the medium is moving, so we have to consider how that affects the observed speed.

So normally, if a medium is moving at velocity v, the speed of light inside it in the lab frame would be affected. But how? I think I should use the relativistic addition formula. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), but wait, that's when transforming from one frame to another moving at velocity v.

Wait, but in this case, the medium is moving. So the speed of light in the medium's frame is c/n.
