Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me start by going through all the information I have.

First, the molecular formula of the compound is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down, the degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here because there's no halogen mentioned. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Let's plug in the numbers: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings, double bonds, etc. Maybe an aromatic ring since the NMR shows some signals around 6.98 and 6.51, which are typical for aromatic protons.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, and 9.7 is very deshielded. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, and they are usually singlets unless next to something that causes splitting. Alternatively, maybe an alpha proton to a carbonyl group, but in this case, a triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, if it's an aldehyde, it's usually a singlet because it's at the end of the chain. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's a vinylic proton adjacent to a carbonyl, but that might be lower ppm.

-6.98 (d, 2H): Downfield, doublet. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons, like on a phenyl group where the substituent is in the para position. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group like nitro, or maybe a substituent like OH in para position. Wait, but the OH would be de-shielded and possibly broad, but in this case, the 9.72 peak is a triplet, not broad. So maybe it's a substituent other than OH.

-6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet, perhaps the ortho positions relative to the substituent on the benzene ring.

-6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests either exchange with something (like an -OH proton) or maybe a coupling with multiple protons. Maybe these are protons on a vinyl group, but why the broadness? Or perhaps they're adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system.

-3.66 (d, 2H): Doublet, 2H. This looks like a CH2 group, possibly next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or a CH2 connected to something else, like an amine or carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure involves a benzene ring (since the NMR shows aromatic protons) and another substituent. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is a bit puzzling. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe the compound has a benzaldehyde group, but that would be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or aldehyde, but in this case, the aldehyde is more likely. Wait, but the triplet suggests that the proton is adjacent to two others. So maybe it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Oh wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the triplet is a vinylic proton adjacent to two other protons on a double bond. So maybe it's part of an enal structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So one of the nitrogens is in there. Maybe it's an amine or amide. But the NMR doesn't show any signals around 2-3 ppm which would typically be for amines. So maybe it's a nitro group? But nitro groups are usually de-shielded and appear as a singlet around 8 ppm, but I don't see a singlet here. Alternatively, maybe the nitrogen is in a ring, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring connected to a side chain. Let's say, for example, the benzene ring has a substituent that's a side chain with another aromatic ring or a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR again, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet. If it's an aldehyde, why is it a triplet? Maybe because it's next to another CH2 group. Wait, if the structure is something like RCHO, where R is CH2CH2 something else. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl. For example, in a compound like CH2=CH-CO-R. Then, the vinylic protons would be near the carbonyl. So the proton on the double bond next to the carbonyl could be split into a triplet if it's adjacent to two other protons. Like if it's CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe this is a conjugated system, like a dienol or something else. Wait, the 9.72 is a triplet, perhaps from a CH group next to two other CH groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a cinnamaldehyde structure.

Wait, let me think about the reactions. The compound is reacted with three reagents:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is typically a nitrous acid formation, used in diazotization. So it's a reaction that forms a diazonium salt, usually from an aromatic amine. Wait, but our molecular formula has an NO, so if it's an aromatic amine, R-NH2, then nitrous acid would convert it to R-N2+Cl-. But if the compound doesn't have an aromatic amine, what else could this reagent do? Maybe it's being used in some other way, like in a substitution or as an acid.

Wait, but the initial compound has one N and one O. So if it's an aromatic amine, that would account for the N and O elsewhere. Or maybe the N is part of a nitro group or amide. Hmm, the NMR doesn't show any typical amine signals, though.

Wait, maybe the initial structure contains a hydroxyl group (the O) and an amine. Let's see: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count valence: Each carbon is four bonds. So 8 carbons, each four bonds: 8*4=32. Hydrogen is 9, so 9 H. Nitrogen: one, which can have up to three bonds (like in an amine). Oxygen: one, which can have two bonds (like in an alcohol, ether, or carbonyl). So the degrees of unsaturation are 5, as calculated before.

Let me think of possible structures. One possibility is a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 double bonds in the ring, but actually one ring and three double bonds, but each double bond is a degree. Wait, benzene is three degrees of unsaturation (three double bonds) plus one ring, but that's actually one ring and three double bonds, which is a total of four degrees (each double bond is one, each ring is one). So benzene ring accounts for four. So the remaining degree of unsaturation is one, which could be a double bond or a ring or another double bond.

So, if the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that has another double bond or another ring, or maybe a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR again, the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be a conjugated diene or a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen.

Another thought: the NMR has a triplet at 9.72. Could that be an aldehyde proton where the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 and are typically singlets. Unless it's in a different environment, maybe. Or perhaps it's a vinylic proton next to two others.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone. Wait, but a ketone's alpha protons are usually around 2-3 ppm, not 9.7. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the 9.72 ppm is a conjugated carbonyl, like an enal. Enals have aldehyde and double bonds adjacent, with the aldehyde's proton possibly coupled with the vinylic protons. So if the structure is something like CH2=CH-CO-R, then the aldehyde's proton would be a triplet if coupled with two adjacent protons. But wait, in that case, the aldehyde is at the end, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is R-CHO with adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative. For example, benzaldehyde would have an aldehyde proton as a singlet. But here, it's a triplet, so maybe it's attached to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2. So maybe it's something like Ph-CH2-CHO. Then the aldehyde would be at the end, so its proton would be a triplet from coupling with the adjacent CH2 group. Let me think: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that would be longer. Or perhaps Ph-CH2-CHO. Then the aldehyde proton would be adjacent to the CH2 group, which has two protons. So the aldehyde's proton would be a triplet, since it's next to two protons. That would fit the NMR data.

So, structure is Ph-CH2-CHO. So, the aldehyde (CHO) is at the end, next to a CH2 group. Then, the NMR would show the aldehyde proton as a triplet. That makes sense. Now, looking at the other signals:

- The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm could be the protons on the benzene ring. Let's say the benzene is para-substituted. So the two protons are in the para position, giving two doublets. For example, if the benzene has an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group or another substituent, causing the protons to be downfield. But wait, in the NMR, the 6.98 is a d (doublet) of 2H, and 6.51 is also a d of 2H. That suggests that the benzene has substituents in two positions, perhaps para and ortho? Or maybe it's a substituent in one position, causing two sets of doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene is part of a diphenyl group. For example, the compound might be something like diphenylacetaldehyde. Wait, diphenylacetaldehyde would have a structure like Ph-CH2-CHO. So the aldehyde is at the end. The benzene rings would each have substituents in specific positions. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show each benzene ring's protons. But in the given NMR, there are two doublets for 2H each. So maybe the benzene is more substituted. Let me think.

Wait, the structure could be a diphenylethanal. For example, (Ph)2CHCHO. But that would have more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is connected to a substituent that has a double bond.

Wait, another thought. The triplet at 9.72 could be a vinylic proton adjacent to another CH2 group. Let me think about the structure being Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, that would make the aldehyde a triplet, but the other CH2 groups would have protons in the 3.66 region perhaps. Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a d (doublet) for 2H. So 2 hydrogens, which are split into a doublet. That's probably a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom. So, perhaps OCH2 or NCH2. But in this case, the molecular formula doesn't have an oxygen in CH2 besides the O in the aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility is that the 3.66 ppm is a CH2 connected to a carbonyl group. For example, R-CO-CH2-R', which would cause the CH2 protons to be deshielded and appear around 3.6. So perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH2-CHO. But that would require more carbons than the formula allows. Let me count: Ph is 6 carbons, CO is one, CH2 is 2, CHO is another. So 6+1+2+1=10, which is more than 8. So that doesn't fit.

Another approach: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see possible functional groups. The presence of NaNO2 and HCl suggests maybe a diazotization reaction. But that typically requires an aromatic amine. So if the initial compound has an aromatic amine (like aniline), then the first reagent would form a diazonium salt. But the NMR doesn't show any signals typical for aniline (like around 4 ppm for NH2, but that's usually broad). Alternatively, maybe the N is part of a nitro group. But then, how does that react with NaNO2 and HCl?

Wait, maybe the initial compound's structure is a benzamide. But benzamide would have a structure like Ph-CONH2. But the molecular formula would be C8H7NO2, which doesn't match. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a phenyl group attached to a side chain with a nitro group. But that would change the molecular formula.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the reactions first. The initial
