Okay, so I've got this question about transiting exoplanets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of the star from our point of view, which is a geometric probability.

Wait, the formula for the probability of transit is roughly (R_p / a) * (something), but I think it's more precise to say that the probability is (R_s + R_p) / a, where R_s is the star's radius, R_p is the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's often approximated as R_s / a, because R_p is negligible. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_s) / (a) multiplied by the fraction of the orbit where the planet could cross our line of sight. Oh wait, another factor is the inclination of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_s + R_p) / a divided by (something else...).

Wait, I think the exact formula for the transit probability is (R_s + R_p) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so it simplifies. So the probability is (R_s + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, we can approximate it as R_s / a. So the probability is proportional to R_s / a.

Now, in the question, both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. Using Kepler's third law, which says that P² is proportional to a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. Wait, Kepler's third law in more precise terms is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M+m ≈ M. So P² ∝ a³ / M.

So if Planet_1 has a period P1 = (1/3) P2, then (P1)^2 = (1/9) (P2)^2. Therefore, (a1)^3 / M1 = (a2)^3 / M2 *
