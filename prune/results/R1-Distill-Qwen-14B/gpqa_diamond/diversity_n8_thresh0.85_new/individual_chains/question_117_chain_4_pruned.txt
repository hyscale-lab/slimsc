Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually comes from stereocenters or geometric isomerism. Wait, wait—no, geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but does it lead to optical activity? I think optical activity is more about the presence of chiral centers. Or wait, maybe in some cases, like with allenes or certain ring structures, there can be other forms of chirality.

Let me look at the options one by one.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining the numbers 1-4 in different ways.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate

Hmm, this one has a biphenyl structure. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, but wait, the nitro groups are at 6 and 6'. Wait, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Then, on each ring, there's a substituent at position 2 and 2'. Wait, the substituents are the dicarboxylate and the nitro groups. Wait, the structure is a bit complex. But I'm trying to think if it has any stereogenic centers.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the possibility of the biphenyl having a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetric, maybe it's not chiral. Wait, in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2'—so on each ring, the substituents are both at 2. But then, for the nitro groups, they are at 6 and 6' on each ring. Wait, maybe that's the same as 4 and 4' positions, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about the positions. Biphenyl rings are connected at 1 and 1'. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. For the first ring: substituent at 2 is the carboxylate group, and at 6 is the nitro. For the other ring, same? Because they are 6,6'—so each has a nitro at 6. Wait, but 2 and
