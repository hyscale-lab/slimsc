Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Benzene rings with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering the positions correctly is important. Let me imagine the benzene ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement? Or wait, no. Wait, 1 and 3 are adjacent, actually. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row. So 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 in a consecutive manner. So the structure would have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so substituents at 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So the ethoxy is at position 1, then moving clockwise, next is tert-butyl at 2, then nitro at 3. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to find the correct order that leads to the target molecule.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So we need to perform three substitution reactions on benzene. But the order in which these are added matters because each substituent can direct the next substitution.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group, which donates electrons through resonance). Nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Tert-butyl is a bulky activating group (since it's an alkyl group) which is a strong activating ortho/para director.

Wait, but when adding substituents, each new group will influence where the next
