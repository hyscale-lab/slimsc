Each option is evaluated based on its structural features:\n\n### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  \nThis molecule consists of a triphenylene core (three benzene rings arranged symmetrically) fused with a trifuran system. The triphenylene part has a threefold rotation axis due to the symmetric arrangement of the three benzene rings at 120\u00b0 intervals. Additionally, the molecule appears to be planar, which would allow for a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, this molecule satisfies the requirements for **C\u2083h** symmetry.\n\n### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  \nThis molecule features a benzo group fused with a trifuran system. While the benzo group introduces some symmetry, the arrangement of the substituents does not clearly support a threefold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. The symmetry of this molecule is likely lower than **C\u2083h**.\n\n### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  \nThis molecule has a trigonal planar arrangement around the central boron atom, which provides a **C\u2083** axis. However, the bulky isopropyl groups disrupt the planarity of the molecule, making it unlikely to have a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C\u2083h** symmetry.\n\n### Option D: Quinuclidine  \nQuinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a seven-membered ring. It is chiral, meaning it lacks any plane of symmetry. Chiral molecules cannot have **C\u2083h** symmetry because the presence of a mirror plane would render the molecule achiral.\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe only molecule that satisfies both the threefold rotation axis and the horizontal mirror plane requirements is **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**.\n\n**Answer: A**"
