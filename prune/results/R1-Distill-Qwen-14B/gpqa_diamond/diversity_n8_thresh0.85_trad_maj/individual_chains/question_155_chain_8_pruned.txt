Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, which is denoted as ΔP_z. From what I remember, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

First, I need to figure out the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. The state the system is in is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that out:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
      [ 1/√2 ]
      [ -1/2 ]

Wait, no, actually, the vector is a column with those elements. So it's a 3x1 column vector.

The P_z matrix is given. Let me write that down. From the question, the P_z matrix has:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

So it's a 3x3 matrix. In terms of components, it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since ψ is a column vector, ψ† is the row vector with the complex conjugates of its elements. But looking at the elements given, they are all real numbers, so ψ† would be [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2].

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check: the state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So ψ has elements ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2. All real, so their conjugates are the same as themselves.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me compute that. The matrix P_z is diagonal, so when I do ψ† P_z, it would be [ -1/2 * ħ, (1/√2)*0, -1/2 * (-ħ) ]? Wait, perhaps I should do it step by step.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of matrix multiplication. The product P_z ψ is:

Each entry in the resulting vector is the dot product of each row of P_z with ψ.

So first entry: (ħ, 0, 0) · [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] = ħ*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second entry: (0, 0, 0) · same vector → 0.

Third entry: (0, 0, -ħ) · vector → 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ)*(-1/
