Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about determining the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues given are from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm^-1, so that makes sense.

Now, looking at the NMR spectrum. There are six signals in total. Let me list what each signal corresponds to:

1. Two aromatic-H signals. So the ring has two different sets of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, this suggests that the substituents are in positions that cause different environments for the protons. For example, para substitution would give two sets of two protons each (like two doublets), but if it's ortho or meta, maybe more splitting?

Wait, wait. The aromatic ring has six members, so it's likely benzene or similar. Di-substituted benzene rings can lead to different NMR patterns based on substitution positions. For example, para substitution gives two sets of equivalent protons (two doublets, each integrating to 2H), while ortho substitution might give more complex splitting. Hmm.

But according to the problem, there are two aromatic signals. So maybe each substituent is in such a position that it creates two unique environments. Like, if the substituents are in the para position relative to each other but each substituent is different, then maybe each substituent's adjacent protons are different. Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is such that it causes splitting. For instance, one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else. Let's think about that.

Then, the NMR also shows two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, like in an alkene or maybe in a substituent like a vinyl group attached to the ring.

The two CH3 groups each have their own signals. So, two different methyl groups. So, the compound has two methyl groups in two different environments.

No signals for CH2 groups, so the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. So all the carbons attached to hydrogens are either CH3 or CH or maybe CH in a more complex environment.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The presence of an ester group suggests that the substituents might be something like an ester group (like OCOOR) and another group.

Wait, di-substituted benzene with an ester group and another group. Let me think: perhaps one substituent is an ester, like a COOR group, and the other substituent is something else, maybe a vinyl group or another substituent with a methyl group.

Wait, but the vinyl protons are on a double bond. So maybe one substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH2CH2 group attached? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methoxy group? No, because that wouldn't explain the vinyl signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a group that has a double bond, like a vinyl group. For example, one substituent is COOR (ester) and the other is a vinyl group, such as CH2CH2 in some configuration.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals. The two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet (so maybe it's coupled to one neighbor), and the other is a doublet of quartets (coupled to two groups, perhaps). Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is part of a substituent like an ester with a vinyl group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like COOR) and an allyl group or something else.

Wait, but another way to approach this is to calculate the molecular formula. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The molecular formula can be determined by figuring out the degrees of unsaturation. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N.

Let's take each option:

Option A: C11H14O2. C=11, H=14, O=2.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14 ) /2 = (24-14)/2 = 10/2=5.

So 5 degrees: benzene ring (3 from the ring, 1 from the ester's carbonyl makes 4, and one more could be a double bond somewhere else. Or maybe the ester and the ring account for 4, and another double bond for the fifth.)

Option D: C11H12O2. (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees. Similarly, benzene (3), ester (1), and another double bond.

Wait, the ring is the major component. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted. So benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R or perhaps an ester group like RCOOR'.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (like OCOOR) and a methyl group, but that might not explain the vinyl signals.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl protons, so perhaps one of the substituents is a vinyl group, such as an allyl ester or something.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. Let's imagine substituents are an ester and a vinyl group.

So structure could be something like:

Phenyl ring with ester group (like -O-CO-R) and a vinyl group (like -CH2CH2- but that's not a vinyl; vinyl is -CH2-CH2-? No, wait, vinyl is a substituent like -CH2-CH2-? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So substituent would be CH2CH2 something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like an ester where the R group is a vinyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another way: looking at the substituents. The presence of two methyl groups (CH3) in the
