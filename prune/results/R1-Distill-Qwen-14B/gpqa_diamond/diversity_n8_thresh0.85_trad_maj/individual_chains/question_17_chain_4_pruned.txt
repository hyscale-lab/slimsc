Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (K) tells me about the stability of that complex. A high K, like 5e10, suggests a very stable complex.

So the problem is about the dissociation of this complex. The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think that when the complex dissociates, it releases calcium ions and EDTA. The reaction would be something like Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution. Since K is given as the formation constant, I should recall how that relates to the dissociation. Wait, formation constant K_f is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²− 

The K_f = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But in this problem, we have the dissociation of the complex, so the reverse reaction would have a K equal to 1/K_f. So K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11 approximately.

Wait, but the problem gives K as K_Ca-EDTA. I should make sure whether K is the formation or dissociation constant. Oh wait, the question states K_Ca-EDTA =5e10. So, that's the formation constant. So the dissociation would be K = 1/(5e10).

So, in the solution, the complex is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA. Let me model the situation. Let’s assume that the dissociation is x. So, at equilibrium:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is expected to be very small because K is large, so the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much).

Wait, no. Wait, K_f is large, so the complex is stable; the dissociation is minimal. So x is very small. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x. Because each mole of complex that dissociates produces one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA.

So the expression for the dissociation K would be K = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA²−]. Since K = 1/(5e10) ≈ 2e-11.

So, substituting:

( x * x ) / (0.02) ) = 2e-11

So, x² = (2e-11 * 0.02)
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.
