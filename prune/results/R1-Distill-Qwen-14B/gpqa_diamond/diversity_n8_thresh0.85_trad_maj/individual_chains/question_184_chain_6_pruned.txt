Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis pathways. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, wait, let me draw that out mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). So numbering the ring, it's ethoxy at para position (assuming benzene is numbered such that substituents are in order), but actually, wait, in 1-ethoxy-2-t-Bu-3-nitro, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So if I imagine the benzene ring, ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. That's a meta arrangement for some of them, but the key is the relative positions.

The starting material is benzene, and I need to find the correct sequence of reactions from the options A to D. Each option lists a series of steps, each with reagents. I need to pick the right order.

First, I should think about the directing effects of substituents. Benzene is the starting point, and each substitution will add a group in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Let's break down the target molecule. The substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Wait, ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director), nitro is a deactivating, meta director. Tert-butyl is a bulky activating group (ortho/para, but being bulky, it directs more to para, but in this case, the substituents are in specific positions).

Wait, but the target substituents are in 1, 2, and 3 positions. So let me imagine the benzene ring: positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2 (which is adjacent to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (adjacent to t-Bu and across from ethoxy? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the order in which we add substituents. The positions of substituents depend on the order of addition because each group directs where the next group goes.

So the target has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. Let's think about the best order to add them.

Option 1: Add the nitro group first. Nitro is a meta director. Then add the ethoxy group (OEt) and the t-Bu.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so after adding nitro, the next substituent (say, OEt) would go meta to nitro. Then t-Bu would go where? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe OEt is added first. Since OEt is activating and directs ortho
