Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically about creating a transgenic mouse model. The goal is to overexpress the GADD45G protein, which is involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The problem arises when the protein isn't overexpressing as expected. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The setup is that they introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Then they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence. Let me think about what might be wrong with it. The sequence is the plus strand of the construct. So I should probably look for any issues in the coding region.

Hmm, the first thing I notice is the start codon. The sequence starts with ATG, which is correct for methionine (the start codon). Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine, but wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. Oh, wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so perhaps the construct includes the HA sequence right after the start codon. So, the HA tag should come first, followed by GADD45G.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Let's see, each codon is three letters. So:

ATG = Met
TAC = Tyr
CCA = Pro
TAC = Tyr
GAT = Asp
GTT = Val
CC... Hmm, that's the coding sequence. So the first part after ATG is TAC, which is a codon for Tyr. But the HA tag is probably a short sequence, like YPYDVPDYD, or something else. Wait, no, the HA tag is just a small peptide. The HA determinant is a short sequence, maybe around 10 amino acids. But in the provided sequence, after the ATG, the next codon is TAC, which is Tyr. That's the first amino acid of the HA tag? Or is HA supposed to come before the GADD45G?

Wait, no. The construct is supposed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the HA tag should be the first part of the protein, followed by GADD45G. So the coding sequence should start with the HA sequence, then GADD45G.

So perhaps the problem is that the HA sequence isn't present in the provided sequence. Looking at the given DNA sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc. But the HA tag's DNA sequence is something like ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT... wait, no, the HA tag's DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCA CCA GAA AGT TCA CCA GAA AGT. Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is just a short sequence, but if
