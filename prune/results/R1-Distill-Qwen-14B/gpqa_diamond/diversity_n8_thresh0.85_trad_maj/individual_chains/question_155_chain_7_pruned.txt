Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given in a 3x3 matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which makes sense because in quantum mechanics, it's common to choose the basis of the eigenstates of a particular observable when dealing with its operator.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Wait, okay, so the uncertainty in Pz. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for the given state.

But first, let's clarify the state. The state is an eigenstate of Px, but to find the expectation values of Pz, perhaps I need to express this state in the eigenbasis of Pz or just compute it directly since the basis is already the Pz eigenbasis.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the given state is expressed in this basis. That means the state is already a column vector in the Pz basis. So I can directly compute the expectation values using matrix multiplication.

So, the state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me write that as a column vector for clarity.

Wait, but wait a second: the components of the state vectors are given as ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). Are these normalized? Let me check: the sum of the squares is ( (1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So yes, the state is normalized.

So, to find ⟨Pz⟩, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ. Similarly for ⟨Pz²⟩, which is ψ† Pz^2 ψ.

Wait, but what's the matrix form of Pz? Let me look back. The matrix form of Pz has the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So in matrix terms, it's a diagonal matrix with ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it out:

Pz matrix:
Row 1: ħ, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -ħ

So, yes, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

Because the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, the components of the state vector ψ are the coefficients in this basis. So each component of ψ corresponds to the amplitude of each Pz eigenstate.

Wait, but the eigenstates of Pz are |+z⟩, |0⟩, |-z⟩, corresponding to the eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, respectively. So the state ψ is written as a linear combination of these.

So, the state ψ is:

ψ = [ -1/2 ] |+z⟩ + [ 1/√2 ] |0⟩ + [ -1/2 ] |-z⟩.

Wait, no, because the first component is for |+z⟩, the second for |0⟩, and the third for |-z⟩.

Now, to compute
