Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? 

So the solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate salts, respectively. 

Wait, KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K H2PO4. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, I think. When dissolved, it would give Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I remember that these can form a buffer solution because they're conjugate acid-base pairs. The H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, right?

But the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, but in the solution, are there any PO4^3- ions? Because phosphate (PO4^3-) is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, HPO4^2- can act as an acid or a base. So depending on the pH, it might dissociate further. Let me think about the Ka values. The given Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

Ka1 is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-.
Ka2 is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-.
Ka3 is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

So, in solution, PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-. But how much of that happens? Well, the solution has a pH determined by the buffer system of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in this case, the solution is a mixture of a
