Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the problem is about using the Boltzmann distribution to find the relation between the temperatures of the two stars.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor... right, in LTE, the probability of a particle being in an excited state is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I remember is something like N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights and k is the Boltzmann constant.

In this question, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I think 1.38e-23 J is actually k, the Boltzmann constant. Because k is approximately 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K. So if ΔE is given as k, that might be a clue.

Wait, no, the problem says the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So maybe they're using ΔE = k, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

The problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So the ratio of the excited states in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. Let's denote this ratio as N1/N2 = 2.

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars since they're both iron atoms in the same energy levels. So g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, so the ratio g_upper/g_lower would cancel out. So the equation simplifies to N1/N2 = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) ) / exp( - (ΔE)/(k T2) )

Let me write that down. N1/N2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which can be rewritten as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So,

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So in this case, a is -ΔE/(k T1) and b is -ΔE/(k T2). So a - b = [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So N1/N2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

We are told that N1/N2 is 2. So,

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k = 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting that in,

ln(2) = (k)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Simplify, the k's cancel:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me check that.

Yes, because 1/T2 = T1/(T1 T2) and 1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2). So 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, putting it together,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which can be rearranged as,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). 

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The observed ratio of excitation levels is 2:1 (N1/N2 = 2), and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10^(-23) J, which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of excitation levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Substituting \( N_1/N_2 = 2 \) and \( \Delta E = k \), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{k}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Simplifying, the \( k \)'s cancel:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), we get:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches the equation given in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
