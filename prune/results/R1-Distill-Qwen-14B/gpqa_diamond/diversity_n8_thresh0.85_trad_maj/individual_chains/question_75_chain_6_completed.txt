Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. The setup is a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, the researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is overexpressed. They're using a construct that includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an added influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected this plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies.

But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. So they're looking into why this is happening. The given sequence is the plus strand of the construct, and the question is pointing out the reason in the options A-D.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I should check for any issues that might prevent proper expression. Let's see. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the beginning is correct.

I remember that in eukaryotic genes, the coding sequence usually includes a Kozak sequence around the start codon (like in mammals) to ensure proper initiation of translation. The Kozak sequence is typically something like 'CCACCAUGG' where the start codon is AUG. But in this sequence, the start is ATG, which is correct for a start codon. Wait, but in mammalian systems, the Kozak sequence is important for efficient translation. If it's missing or incorrect, the ribosome might not initiate properly.

Looking at the beginning of the sequence: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, looking at the first few nucleotides after the start codon (ATG). The next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (Pro), then TAC ( Tyr ), then CGA (Arg), etc. But wait, the Kozak sequence is important for efficient translation in mammalian systems. The standard Kozak is 'CCACCAUGG', so the nucleotides around the start codon are crucial.

In the given sequence, the start is ATG. The nucleotides before the start are ... let me see. Looking at the very beginning: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC ... So the sequence before the ATG is whatever is upstream. But in the coding region, the Kozak sequence is typically something like 'gccgccAUGG', where the 'gcc' before the AUG is important. In this case, the ATG is preceded by TAC, but wait, perhaps the Kozak sequence isn't present.

Wait, but the sequence given is the coding sequence, right? So the plasmid has the coding sequence (CDS) for the gene, which starts with ATG. But for proper translation, the Kozak sequence is needed. Without it, the ribosome might not efficiently recognize the start codon, leading to low or no expression of the protein.

So the issue could be that the construct lacks a Kozak sequence, meaning the ribosome isn't initiating translation properly. That would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed. If the ribosome can't find the start codon well, the protein won't be made.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. Well, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If there's a mutation, the tag might be altered, but the construct would still produce some protein. Also, the problem is not about the HA but the lack of expression. So this might not be the main issue.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean the protein is truncated, but the question says the protein isn't overexpressed at all. So this is more about termination, but if the ribosome didn't start, it wouldn't even make a partial protein.

Option C: No linker, triggering proteolysis. If there's no linker, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation. But the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's expressed and then degraded. So this might not explain lack of expression, but more of a truncated or improper form.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. The UAA codon is a stop codon. In the sequence, I don't see any UAA; the stop codon is TGA at the end. Wait, looking at the end, the sequence ends with ... CCCGAGTGA. So that's the TGA stop codon. Mammalian cells have tRNAs for all stop codons? No, wait, tRNA doesn't recognize stop codons. Stop codons are recognized by release factors. So the presence or absence of tRNA for UAA isn't the issue here because UAA isn't the stop codon used here.

Wait, the stop codon is TGA, which is recognized by the release factor. So that's correct. So option D is not the issue.

Wait, but the options include some other possibilities. Let me think again about the Kozak sequence. The presence of a proper Kozak sequence is important for initiation in mammalian systems. If the construct doesn't include it, the ribosome can't efficiently recognize the start codon, leading to low or no expression.

Looking at the start of the sequence again, the start codon is ATG, and the preceding nucleotides are TAC (which is T-A-C). So the nucleotides before the ATG would be the reverse complement. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The sequence given is the plus strand, so the coding sequence is as written.

In the Kozak consensus sequence, the nucleotides at positions -3 and +4 are important. The sequence is often CCACCAUGG. So the nucleotides before the start codon (positions -3, -2, -1) are ACC, and after (positions +1, +2, +3) are GGT. Wait, but in this case, the sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT... So the nucleotides before ATG are TAC (positions -3 to -1, but wait, it's plus strand. So the -3 position would be the third nucleotide before ATG, which is TAC's third base, which is C. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct doesn't have a Kozak sequence, which is necessary for the ribosome to bind and initiate translation. Without this, the ribosome can't find the ATG, so the protein isn't made.

So the most likely reason is that the construct doesn't have a proper Kozak sequence, causing the ribosome to not initiate, leading to no protein expression.

Looking at the options, none of them directly mention the Kozak sequence, but option B says the ribosome terminated early. But if the ribosome doesn't initiate, it won't have any protein. Alternatively, option C is about proteolysis, but that's about degradation after synthesis, not lack of initiation.

Wait, maybe the issue is with the start codon itself. Does the sequence encode a proper start? Let me check. The first codon is ATG, which is methionine. So that's correct. So that's not the issue.

Hmm, another possibility is the presence of a premature stop codon elsewhere in the sequence, but looking at the sequence, I don't see any in-frame stop codons except the last TGA at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct has a frameshift or a mutation, but the question indicates that the provided sequence is the actual construct, and the researcher 'realizes the reason' from it.

So, considering the options, the problem is likely that the ribosome isn't initiating correctly because of the lack of Kozak sequence. But the options don't directly say that. Let me look again.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would imply that the ribosome did start, but stopped early, leading to truncated proteins. But the issue is that the protein isn't expressed at all. So that's not it.

Option C: The lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So if there's no linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G, perhaps the protein is being recognized for degradation. But again, this would affect the protein after it's made, not prevent its expression. So the researcher wouldn't see any expression because the protein is being broken down. But the question states that the overexpression isn't happening, so maybe the construct is correct but the protein isn't being made in the first place.

Wait, another possibility is that the stop codon is incorrect. Let me check the sequence again. The end is ...AAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the construct doesn't have a poly-A tail. But the question doesn't mention anything about that. Alternatively, maybe the promoter isn't correctly included. But the options don't mention that either.

Wait, the options are A to D. So I have to choose from them. Let's re-examine each option.

Option A: HA has a missense. If the HA is mutated, the protein would still be expressed but might not be recognized by the antibody. But the issue here is that the protein isn't being expressed, so this is probably not the cause.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. If the ribosome stops early, you'd get a truncated protein, but the question says the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe no, but perhaps the ribosome isn't initiating.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. If the ribosome can't initiate, you don't get any protein. If it initiates but stops early, you get a smaller protein, which is still expressed but not full-length. The problem is the lack of overexpression, so maybe the ribosome isn't initiating.

So in that case, why would the ribosome not initiate? Because there's no Kozak sequence. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the closest option is B, which says the ribosome terminated early. But that doesn't make sense because if it doesn't initiate, it doesn't terminate.

Wait, maybe the construct has a UAA codon earlier, which is a stop. But looking through the sequence, I don't see any UAA codons in frame. The sequence is all in the same reading frame, and the only stop is at the end. So that's not it.

Another point: If the construct is in a plasmid, perhaps the issue is with the selection markers or promoters, but the question says they used Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance, so the plasmid probably has the correct elements.

Wait, looking back at the sequence, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), etc. So the start codon is followed by a few other codons. If the Kozak sequence is missing, the ribosome doesn't recognize the ATG, so it doesn't translate.

So the issue is the absence of the Kozak sequence, leading to no translation. But looking at the options, there's no option that says that. So perhaps the problem is that the ribosome is terminating early because of a mutation in the start codon. Wait, no, the start codon is ATG, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that there's a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the reading frame. Let me scan the sequence for any TGA, TAG, or TAA. The end has TGA, which is correct. Before that, looking for any other in-frame stops. Let's see, each three nucleotides:

Looking for 'TAA', 'TAG', 'TGA' in the sequence.

The sequence is long, but I'll look for these triplets.

Looking through:

... TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG ... 

Wait, TGA is at the end of the first part. So the only in-frame stop is at the end, which is correct. So that's not the issue.

Another possibility: The construct has a frameshift, but the given sequence doesn't seem to have any frameshift because the codons are triplets and the entire sequence is a single reading frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is placed in the wrong reading frame. But the question says the HA is at the N-terminus, so it should be in the same frame as the GADD45G.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence introduces a stop codon. Let me look at the HA sequence. The HA tag is a short peptide, typically YPYDVPDYA. The coding sequence for HA would be something like ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA (or similar). Wait, the first part of the given sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So that's ATG (start), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop). Wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the HA coding sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

Wait, that's 11 codons: ATG (1), TAC (2), CCA (3), TAC (4), GAT (5), GTT (6), CCA (7), GAT (8), TAC (9), GCC (10), AAA (11), TGA (stop at 12).

Wait, no: 12th codon is TGA. So the HA tag would be from 1 to 11, and then stop. But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be a short peptide, but this sequence includes a stop codon right after the HA. So perhaps the construct includes the HA tag followed by a stop codon, but the GADD45G coding sequence is after that. But that would mean the HA is only expressed as a separate peptide, and the GADD45G isn't being expressed because the stop codon ends translation early.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the HA sequence includes a stop codon, the ribosome would translate the HA and then stop, not proceeding to the GADD45G sequence. So the GADD45G isn't expressed because the stop codon is in the same reading frame.

So in the construct, the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, which is causing the ribosome to terminate early, preventing the translation of the GADD45G gene. Looking back, the plus strand sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... which is the HA coding sequence followed by TGA as a stop. So the HA is expressed, but then the ribosome stops, and the GADD45G isn't made.

Wait, but the HA is supposed to be part of the same protein. So the construct must be designed such that the HA is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. Therefore, the HA sequence shouldn't have a stop codon in the same frame. The HA's coding sequence must be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence without a stop in between.

Looking at the given construct, the HA sequence includes a TGA stop codon in the same frame. That's a problem. The HA should be followed by the GADD45G gene in the same reading frame, but the TGA is causing the ribosome to stop, so the GADD45G isn't made. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed.

But wait, the GADD45G coding sequence in the construct follows after the HA. Let me see the entire sequence. The HA sequence is the first part, and then the rest is GADD45G.

Wait, the given entire sequence is the coding sequence for the HA-GADD45G fusion protein. So the HA is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. But in the construct, after the HA, there's a TGA, which would terminate the translation prematurely, before the GADD45G is expressed.

So the mistake is that the HA coding sequence includes a stop codon, which is causing the ribosome to stop before the GADD45G is translated. Therefore, the GADD45G isn't expressed because the stop codon is in the way.

So looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case if the HA's sequence includes a stop codon, causing the ribosome to stop before the GADD45G gene is reached. So the construct is producing the HA tag but not the GADD45G because of the premature stop.

Alternatively, option C suggests a lack of linker leading to proteolysis. But that's about degradation after expression, not preventing expression.

So the correct answer should be option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but the HA might be correctly expressed as a fusion if the HA coding sequence doesn't have a stop. So perhaps the HA's coding sequence in the construct is followed by the GADD45G coding without a stop in between. But in the given construct, it's ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So the TGA is a stop, meaning the ribosome stops after the HA. So the construct is incorrect because it includes the stop codon within the HA coding sequence, before the GADD45G starts.

Ah, I see. So the problem is that within the HA coding sequence, there's a TGA stop codon. That's a mistake because the HA should be followed by the GADD45G gene without a premature stop. So the HA is being made, but the ribosome stops, and the GADD45G isn't expressed. Hence, the overall protein isn't overexpressed.

Therefore, the reason is that the HA sequence includes a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the correct answer is option B.


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to an HA tag at the N-terminus. However, the protein is not being overexpressed as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the construct includes the coding sequence for the HA tag followed by the GADD45G gene. Upon analysis, it is observed that the HA coding sequence contains a premature stop codon (TGA) in the same reading frame. This causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely after synthesizing the HA tag, preventing the translation of the GADD45G gene. As a result, the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion protein is not expressed, leading to the lack of overexpression.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence would not prevent the expression of the protein entirely. The issue here is the premature stop codon, not a mutation in the HA sequence. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B:** The ribosome terminating early is consistent with the observation. The premature stop codon in the HA sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation before the GADD45G gene is reached. This matches the observed problem and is the correct answer.
- **Option C:** A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis of the nascent chain, but this would occur after the protein is expressed. The issue here is the absence of protein expression altogether, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D:** The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant because the stop codon in the construct is TGA, which is recognized by the release factor in mammalian cells. This option is incorrect.

The root cause of the lack of protein expression is the premature stop codon in the HA coding sequence, which terminates translation early. 

Answer: B
