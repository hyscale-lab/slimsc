Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, right? So, the compound X probably has a ketone group.

Let's look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, likely due to O-H stretching. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or maybe an ester. Then there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹, which I think are related to aromatic C=C stretching. So, compound X has an aromatic ring and a ketone group. Oh, and the O-H could be from an acid or maybe an alcohol, but with the ketone, maybe it's a ketone adjacent to an -OH group? Or perhaps it's an enol? Wait, but in the NMR, maybe there's a proton that's acidic. Let's check the NMR next.

The 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. High chemical shift like that often corresponds to an -OH proton. But wait, if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad because it's exchanging with water. So, maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. Alternatively, something like an alpha-hydroxy ketone? But the IR doesn't show a peak that suggests an alcohol like an OH stretch around 3300, but the 3400–2500 is broad, which could be O-H from a carboxylic acid or maybe an enol. Hmm.

Wait, wait. The IR data has a 1720 cm⁻¹ which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that's close. So maybe a carboxylic acid. But in the NMR, a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm. So that's a possibility.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): That's likely the protons adjacent to the substituent on the aromatic ring. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the two protons on each adjacent position would be doublets. So maybe two sets of doublets in the aromatic region. Wait, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Let's see, if the substituent is at para position, the two ortho protons would be at higher ppm (8.0), and the two meta protons would be lower (7.2 ppm). But wait, another possibility is that the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ortho protons deshielded. So if the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or a carboxylic acid), the ortho protons would be downfield-shifted.

So, in the aromatic region, two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions? Or perhaps substituents in a way that causes the ortho and para positions to have different shifts. Alternatively, maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene with substituents that cause the splitting. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, you'd have two sets of doublets: the two ortho protons as a doublet (each coupling with the other) and the two meta protons as another doublet. But wait, if the substituent is at the para position, then the ortho protons would be next to the substituent and would be as a doublet. Let me think: for example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the protons adjacent to the aldehyde group are deshielded, appearing as a doublet around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but in this case, the substituent might not be an aldehyde but something else.

Wait, let me think about the other peaks. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like maybe a CH next to a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a CH in a substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be two protons, maybe part of a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet perhaps from a CH3 group attached to a CH (as in isopropyl). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal CH3, like from an ethyl group.

Putting the substituents together: There's a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituent is something like a carbonyl group attached to a chain.

Wait, if the substituent is a ketone, perhaps structure like Ar-C(O)-R. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid's -OH. So perhaps it's a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached. But then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3400, which it does. So, maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but then the IR's 1720 cm⁻¹ would be the carbonyl of the acid. But the carbonyl in carboxylic acids is usually around 1700 cm⁻1, so 1720 is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, which could have a higher wavenumber.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acyl group. Let's think about the NMR. The downfield peaks in the aromatic region suggest substituents that are electron-withdrawing. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached. Let's imagine the structure is something like Ph-C(O)-R. But then, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm would be a different proton. Wait, unless the compound is a ketone with an alpha hydroxyl group. But that's less likely.

Wait, let's try to sketch possible structures. Let's look at the options.

The options are A to D. Let me read them again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, connected to a CH2-COOH group. So the substituent would be CH2COOH attached to the benzene at position 4. Wait, no, the substituent would be an ethyl group on the benzene, and the propanoic acid is connected somewhere else? Or is it benzene with a propanoic acid group attached to the ethyl?

Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: that would be the propanoic acid group (CH2CH2COOH) attached at the 2-position of the phenyl ring. Wait, no, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, and a propanoic acid group attached as a substituent somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is benzene with an ethyl group and a propanoic acid group attached, but I'm not sure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in the para position and a COOH group attached (at position 1, perhaps). So the substituents are at para positions.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show the protons on the benzene ring as two doublets: the ortho to the substituents.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So each is a doublet integrating to 2H, which suggests that the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions, each with two protons adjacent. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, but that would generate symmetrical signals. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single substituent with a certain structure that causes the two sets of doublets.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or a carboxylic acid) in the para position, which would cause the adjacent protons to appear as a doublet. So if the substituent is at position 1, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear as a doublet at around 8.0 ppm. The para position would be position 4, which would have substituent perhaps another group, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group. Wait, but the IR didn't show the ester carbonyl. The IR at 1720 could be a ketone or an ester. Hmm.

Wait, if the IR has 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl. If it's a ketone, then the structure would have a ketone group somewhere. But then the NMR's 10.5 ppm is a bit confusing because a ketone wouldn't have an -OH proton. So that must be from something else, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more typical of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

Looking at the 1H NMR again:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely the -OH of a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): ortho protons.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): para protons? Or meta? Hmm.

Wait, suppose the substituent is a carbonyl group (COOH) in the para position. Then the adjacent (ortho) protons would be at higher ppm, say around 8.0, and the meta would be lower, around 7.2. So in that case, the aromatic ring would have a substituent (like COOH) in the para position, and the substituent would cause the ortho and meta protons to split into two doublets. But wait, if the substituent is only in one position, like position 1, then the ring would have ortho (positions 2 and 6), meta (positions 3 and 5), and para (position 4) protons. The ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So in the NMR, the 8.0 ppm would be the ortho (two H, doublet), and the 7.2 would be the para proton (position 4), but wait, that's only one proton. Hmm, but in the NMR, we have 2H for each, which suggests that they belong to a pair of protons. So perhaps the substituent is in position 1, and the ring has other substituents as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have two substituents, leading to two doublets each integrating to 2H. For example, two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but that would make the compound 1,4-disubstituted, which would have more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branching point. Let's think about the other peaks: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group, and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) a CH3 attached to a CH (like an isopropyl group). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-C(O)-R. Wait, but if it's a carbonyl group, it's either a ketone or something else.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. If the ring has a substituent that's a ketone attached to an ethyl chain, perhaps:

Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a ketone. For example, Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? But then the NMR would show the ketone adjacent to CH2 groups.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is not a ketone, it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps the substituent is a COOH group attached to a branched chain. Let's see:

Looking at the NMR:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH (like in isopropyl). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps part of an ethyl group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl group.

So, putting this together, maybe the substituent is a -COOH group attached to a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something similar. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) with a sec-butyl group at position 4. The sec-butyl group is (CH2CH(CH2CH3)).

So, the NMR for that structure would have:

- The COOH proton at ~10.5 ppm (bs, 1H).
- The aromatic protons: in benzoic acid, the protons ortho to COOH are usually around 8.0-8.3 ppm, and the meta around 7.5-7.8. But in this case, there's another substituent at position 4 (para to COOH), which is a sec-butyl group. So the ring is 1-COOH and 4-sec-butyl.

Wait, the substituent at position 4 would be a sec-butyl group, which is a bulky group. So the aromatic protons would be influenced by both substituents.

But let's consider the splitting. In para-substituted benzene rings, the substituents are opposite each other. So, for 1-COOH and 4-sec-butyl, the ring would have substituents in 1 and 4. But wait, that's the same as para positions because 1 and 4 are across from each other on the benzene ring.

Wait, but in that case, the ring's substitution would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. So the ring would have two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other.

In such a case, the ortho protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (relative to COOH), and the meta protons at positions 3 and 5. But wait, with substituents at 1 and 4, the symmetry would make the ring have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: the substituent at 1 (COOH) would make the ring have a certain symmetry, and the substituent at 4 (sec-butyl) would break that symmetry. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, as would the protons at 3 and 5, but their chemical shifts would be influenced by the substituents.

So, the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH group, which is electron-withdrawing, making them deshielded. So their chemical shift would be around 8.0 ppm. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and adjacent to the sec-butyl group, which is an electron-donating alkyl group, so their shifts would be upfield compared to the ortho protons. But considering the substituent, maybe they are around 7.2 ppm.

So that would fit the NMR data: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), each integrating to 2H.

Now, looking at the rest of the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent. The sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the CH in the middle would have protons that are split into a multiplet. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the two protons on the CH2 adjacent to the CH group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl group attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl from the ethyl group in the sec-butyl.

So that seems to fit.

So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. As I thought earlier, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, if compound X is a benzoic acid, it doesn't have a ketone. So that doesn't make sense. Hmm, I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait a minute, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me re-examine.

If the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl. If it's a ketone, then the Clemmensen reduction would reduce it to an alkane. But in the case of benzoic acid, the carbonyl is a carboxylic acid, which is not reduced by Clemmensen. So if the compound is a ketone, then the product would be an alkane.

But according to the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more typical of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps I need to reconcile this.

Wait, maybe the compound has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the IR.

Wait, wait. Wait, perhaps the 1720 cm⁻¹ is not a carbonyl but something else. But 1720 is a strong peak, which is usually carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the IR's 3400–2500 is not O-H but an alkyne C-H stretch. But that's usually around 3300. But the presence of a broad peak in that region is more indicative of O-H. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is an ester, the IR would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm⁻¹. The O-H stretch in esters is usually not present because they don't have free -OH groups (ester groups have O but not -OH). So in that case, the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't be from an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alpha hydroxyl group. So, a ketone and an -OH adjacent to it. But then, the IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1720 and an O-H stretch around 3400. But then the NMR's 10.5 ppm would be the -OH proton, which could be a broad peak. However, in such a case, the chemical shift might be a bit downfield, but it's possible.

But then, the NMR's aromatic signals would still be as we thought before. Let's imagine the structure is a ketone attached to a benzene ring with a substituent that includes an -OH group in the alpha position. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the rest of the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. But the 10.5 ppm would not fit that, as the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm but as a singlet, not necessarily broad. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm isn't an -OH. Could it be an aldehyde proton? But usually, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm and are split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group, but in this case, it's a broad singlet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton from a different group, like an enol. Enol protons can sometimes appear around 10 ppm, but I'm not sure about their splitting.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a methyl benzoate? No, because the ester carbonyl would be around 1720, and the O-H (from the ester oxygen) isn't present as a free -OH. So the NMR peak at 10.5 ppm wouldn't fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me recap.

The IR suggests a carbonyl group (1720 cm⁻¹) and O-H (3400–2500 cm-1). The NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (probably -OH), aromatic protons, and a chain of CH, CH2, and CH3 groups.

If the compound is a ketone, then the O-H can't be explained. So perhaps the carbonyl in the IR is a ketone, and the O-H is from another group, perhaps an alcohol. But the 10.5 ppm being an -OH from an alcohol is a bit high. Alcohols usually have protons around 1-5 ppm. Unless it's a phenol or an enol.

Wait, but phenol protons are around 6-8 ppm. Hmm. Wait, maybe the compound is a phenol with a ketone group. Then, the IR's O-H would be a broad peak around 3400 cm-1, and the 10.5 ppm in NMR might not fit. So, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an enol. Enol tautomers can show a peak around 10 ppm. But in that case, the IR might not show a strong O-H stretch if it's not in the enol form.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. But then the IR should have a carbonyl around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but the IR data doesn't show that. The IR does have 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹, which are in the aromatic region.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an acidic alpha proton to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone with an alpha hydrogen, the proton could be acidic and appear downfield. But such protons are usually around 9-10 ppm but not as broad as a free -OH. So perhaps it's a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cinnamic acid derivative. Cinnamic acid has a benzene ring connected to a CH2 group and a COOH group. But I'm not sure if that fits the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a ketone with a benzene ring and an adjacent alcohol group, but I'm not seeing how that fits.

Wait, let me think again about the reaction. If the compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI (Clemmensen), the product would be an alkane. So, the starting material must have a ketone group, which is reduced.

But then, the IR's 1720 cm⁻¹ would be the ketone, and the O-H in the IR could be from another group, like an alcohol or maybe an acidic proton.

Wait, but the NMR's 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which for an -OH is broad. So that suggests a free -OH group, which would come from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, but if the starting material is a ketone, then after Clemmensen reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group. So, for example, if the starting material is benzophenone (Ar-CO-Ar), the product would be Ar-CH2-Ar.

But in this case, the starting material has a benzene ring and a chain leading to a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's something like Ar-CO-R, which upon reduction would become Ar-CH2-R.

But the NMR data suggests more than that. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester. Esters have a carbonyl group, and upon Clemmensen reduction, the ester would be reduced to an alcohol. Wait, but Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, not esters. Wait, no, I'm wrong. Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes, not esters. Esters are reduced under different conditions, like with LiAlH4, which reduces them to alcohols.

Wait, so going back: the reaction is Clemmensen, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So the starting material must have a ketone.

So, the IR's 1720 cm⁻¹ is the ketone. The O-H in the IR (3400–2500 cm-1) is probably from another group, perhaps an alcohol or a phenol.

But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which can't be a phenol, as phenol protons are around 6-7 ppm. So maybe it's an alcohol that's exchanging rapidly, giving a broad peak.

Wait, but alcohols usually have protons around 1-5 ppm, so a peak at 10.5 ppm is way too high for an alcohol. Hmm. So perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid. But
