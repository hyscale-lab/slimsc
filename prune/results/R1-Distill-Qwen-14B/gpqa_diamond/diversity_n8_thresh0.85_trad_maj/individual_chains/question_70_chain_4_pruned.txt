Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question again.

The problem describes several reactions and some properties of the compounds involved. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are determined by the highest symmetry operations present in the molecule. So I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its symmetry.

Let me break down the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I'll start by trying to identify the possible compounds based on these reactions.

Looking at reaction 3: C reacting with water gives back A and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is perhaps something like H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak). Or wait, another possibility: maybe F is HNO3 and G is H2CO3 or something else. Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 but that's strong, and G could be another acid.

Wait, but another thought: when a compound reacts with water to produce a solid (A) and two acids, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives those acids. For example, maybe C is a nitrate salt. Let's think: if C is Cu(NO3)2, and when it reacts with water, it might not produce two acids. Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another approach: looking at reaction 4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like DMSO. Hmm, but H is likely a common solvent. Let's think about possible combinations of D and B.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 (oxygen) and D is something else. Or maybe B is Cl2 (chlorine), and D is something that reacts with Cl2 in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, maybe A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2. Then Na would react with Cl2 to form NaCl. But 8 equivalents of Cl2 for each Na? That doesn't seem right because the reaction would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na. But the question says 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, that suggests a high stoichiometric ratio.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is aluminum (Al), which has a +3 charge. If B is Cl2, then 3 equivalents would be needed. But the question says 8. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is iron (Fe) reacting with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But 8 equivalents would be 8 FeCl3 per Fe, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps B is not a diatomic gas but another element. Alternatively, maybe B is O2, and A is a metal oxide. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product C is a metal oxide. But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the other reactions.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. C is bright red, so maybe C is a nitrate or another colored compound.

Wait, if C is a nitrate salt, like sodium nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a transition metal complex. For example, Cu(NO3)2 is bright blue, not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. I'm not quite recalling a bright red nitrate.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide? No, sulfides are usually not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, B is a halogen, and C is the corresponding halide. Let's think about that. For example, if A is Na (solid), and B is Cl2 (gas), then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na. That would produce NaCl. But the reaction equation would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 1 equivalent of Cl2 for 2 Na. So 8 equivalents would require 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na, which is way more than needed—so that doesn't fit. Unless the reaction is different, perhaps a different stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is something like Fe (iron
