Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on relativity and optics, but I'll try to break it down.

The problem says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh right, the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1 here.

Wait, so in the glass, the speed of light is normally c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed in the medium. So when the medium is stationary, the speed is v_light = c/n.

But now the glass is moving. So do I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity or is it a classical approach here? Hmm, the question doesn't specify relativity, but when velocities are involved and you're measuring speeds, relativistic effects might come into play. Wait, but for most problems unless the velocities are a significant fraction of c, classical mechanics might suffice. But in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the speed of light in the glass is v_light = 1/n. So if v is much smaller than c, maybe classical would work. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, let's think. In the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the frame of the
