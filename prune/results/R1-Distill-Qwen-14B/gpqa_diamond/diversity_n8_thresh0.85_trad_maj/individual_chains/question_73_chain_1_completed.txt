Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c.

Wait, but when it comes to relative speed in relativity, it's not as simple as just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). So I should plug in the velocities into that.

Let me compute that. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.142857c. So roughly 0.143c, which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, I see options C and D have 0.14c, so that's a clue.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each one's energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A: v = 0.6c. Gamma_a = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_a is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut B: v = 0.5c. Gamma_b = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute sqrt(0.75). Hmm, sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E_b is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = E_a + E_b ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². That's approximately 5.96 mc², right? Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

Wait, but wait a second. I'm calculating the energies as individual energies and adding them. But when considering the system, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest masses times their respective gammas. That's correct because each is moving relative to an external frame, so their energies are additive.

So putting it together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me quickly check my calculations again.

Gamma for A: 0.6c. (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. 1/0.8=1.25. Correct. So 1.25 *2m c² is 2.5 mc².

Gamma for B: 0.5c. (0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=~0.866. 1/0.866≈1.1547. 1.1547 *3=3.464. So 3.464 mc². Sum is 2.5 +3.464=5.964, which is approximately 5.96 mc². So E=5.96 mc².

So option C is matching both the relative speed and the energy. So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
