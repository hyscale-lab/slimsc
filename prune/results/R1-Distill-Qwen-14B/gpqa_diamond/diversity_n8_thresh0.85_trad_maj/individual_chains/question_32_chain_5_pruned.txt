Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider accelerates heavy ions to very high speeds, close to the speed of light. The question is about calculating the energy when the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light.

Wait, the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh, right, Li is lithium. So Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. The atomic mass of a Li-6 nucleus would be approximately the mass of 6 nucleons. But I might need the exact mass or use the rest mass energy somehow.

I think I should use the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy (mc²). So E = γ * m * c². But wait, I need to find the energy, so I need to compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c. Let's plug that in: v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is indeed 0.0784, correct. So 1/0.28 is 1 / (28/100) )= 100/28 ≈ 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), since each nucleon is about 1 u. Wait, but the exact mass might be slightly less than 6 u due to binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate it as 6 u because the binding energy is small compared to the rest mass. Or perhaps we should use the exact value, but I don't remember it. Wait, no, in particle physics, they often use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus binding energy, but for heavy ions, the binding energy is a small correction. But maybe the problem expects us to use m = 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass.

Wait, but a nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. So, for Li-6, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So the total rest mass of the nucleus would be 3*(938) + 3*(939) ≈ 3*1877 ≈ 5631 MeV or 5.631 GeV.

Wait, wait, but that's the sum of the individual nucleon masses. However, when they form a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. The mass of the nucleus is less than the sum. For example, the mass of Li-6 is about 6 * 1.007276 u (since 6 u is 6 * 1.007276 ≈ 6.04366 u) minus the binding energy. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact mass. Alternatively
