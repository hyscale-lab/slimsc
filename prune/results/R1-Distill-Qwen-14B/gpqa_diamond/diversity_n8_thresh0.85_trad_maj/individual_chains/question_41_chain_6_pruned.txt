Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in a laboratory. Hmm, I remember that in different media, light slows down, right? So the index of refraction n is involved here. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. I'm a bit confused about how the motion of the medium affects the speed of light.

Wait, I think I remember something about the speed of light in a medium when the medium is moving. Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but wait, that's when the medium is part of an inertial frame. Or is it different when the medium is moving through the lab frame?

Wait no, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. But wait, wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium. If the medium itself is moving, does that change the observed speed of light?

Oh, right, because of the way velocities add up in relativity. So if the glass is moving, the observer in the lab would see the light's speed as a combination of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity within the medium.

Wait, but if the light is inside the moving glass, then the speed of the light relative to the lab frame isn't just v (the glass's speed) plus c/n. Because velocities don't just add linearly. Oh wait, right, that's the Galilean addition for non-relativistic speeds, but here we're dealing with light, so we need to use special relativity's velocity addition formula.

But wait, the question specifies that v is the velocity of the glass, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab frame and the glass's frame are moving at velocity v relative to each other. But how does that affect the light's speed?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light should still be c in any inertial frame. So no matter how fast the glass is moving, the light inside it should still be moving at c relative to the lab frame. But that doesn't make sense because the glass has an index of refraction, so in its rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So when the glass is moving, I need to calculate the speed as observed in the lab.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula. When you have two frames moving at velocity u relative to each other, and an object moving at velocity u' in the first frame, the velocity in the second frame is (u' + u)/(1 + (u u')/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving at v.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So from the glass's frame, the light's velocity is (c/n) in the same direction as the glass's motion. So we can apply the velocity addition formula to find the lab frame's measurement.

Wait, but wait a second: the direction matters. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion, so
