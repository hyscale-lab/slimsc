Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Maybe the masses are just extra info that doesn't affect this particular calculation.

The problem lists some elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE. Let's jot down the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what these values mean. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, for example, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) compared to the Sun. If [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means Star_1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's. Same logic for [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So, Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, which implies Fe abundance is same as Sun. [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, Si is 0.3 dex higher than Fe. Since the Sun's Fe is known, I can find the Si abundance.

Similarly for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, so Mg is the same as the Sun. But [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so Mg is 0.3 dex higher than Si. Which would mean that Si is lower than Mg in Star_2.

Wait, let me think in terms of the logarithms. The [X/Y] notation is log10(X/Y) - log10(X/Y)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant than Y relative to the Sun.

So for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3 → So, log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

But what is log(Si/Fe)_sun? Because the Sun's [Si/Fe] is [Si/Fe]_sun = [Si/Fe]_1 - 0.3, but wait no. Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is the base for Star_1. Let me clarify.

Wait, the [X/Y] notation is such that it's the logarithm of (X/Y) relative to the Sun's value. So [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun. That way, if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant than Y compared to the Sun.

So, for Star_1:

log(Si/Fe)_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

But wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given. Hmm, maybe I can calculate it based on the Sun's nFe and nMg, but wait, what about nSi?

Hmm, the Sun's photosphere composition is given for
