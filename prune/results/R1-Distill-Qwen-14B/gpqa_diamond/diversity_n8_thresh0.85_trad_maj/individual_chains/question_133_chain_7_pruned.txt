Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved. But let's take it step by step, right?

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, I think. The solution has two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are dissolved in 200.00 cm³ of solution. The problem gives their masses and molar masses, and also provides the Ka values for H3PO4. The temperature is 25°C, which I remember is standard for such calculations.

Wait, first, I need to figure out what's happening with these two substances. I recall that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate or something like that. Both of these are related to the phosphate ions in solution.

In solution, phosphate exists in various forms: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The K_a values given are for H3PO4 dissociating stepwise. Ka1 is for H3PO4 losing a proton to become H2PO4^-; Ka2 is for H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2-; and Ka3 is for HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about their dissociation. KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- (plus water, but that's just part of the crystal structure, I think).

So, in the solution, we're going to have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Wait, but in the solution, does any of the given compounds directly produce PO4^3-? I don't think so. So how do we get PO4^3-?

Ah, right! Because HPO4^2- can further lose a proton to become PO4^3-, and H2PO4^- can also lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. So we have a buffer system here because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present. But wait, the solution is a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), so it's a buffer solution. So maybe I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2- (PO4^3-). So I think I need to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+.

The Ka2 is given as 6.2e-8, which is for H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+.
