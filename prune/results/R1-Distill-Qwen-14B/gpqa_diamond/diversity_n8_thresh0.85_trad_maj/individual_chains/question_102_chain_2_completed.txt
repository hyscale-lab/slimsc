Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The person made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic means it has two ORFs, so two genes are being expressed from one vector. The vector uses internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or something similar to allow for the expression of two proteins from a single mRNA.

In the construct, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES, right? So the promoter for the ligand is CBA, then comes the ligand, followed by a stop cassette with loxP. Then IRES, then the receptor, and then the stop with lox2272, followed by eGFP.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested with Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading. So they're using actin as a loading control, which is fine. When they made the mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, they crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be expressed under SOX10's regulation, probably activated in neural crest cells.

After crossing, they looked for GFP under a confocal microscope but didn't see a green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, or at least not where they're looking. The question is why.

The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship
B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi
C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing
D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame

Let me think step by step.

First, the setup: the construct is a bicistronic vector with ligand and receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptors are after an IRES, which allows for separate translation. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

Wait, but the ligand has a stop cassette between its ORF and mCherry. Oh, wait, no. The ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. Wait, the way it's worded is: ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Then, between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Hmm.

So the ligand is first, then a stop cassette with loxP. Then comes the IRES, which is upstream of the receptor. Then the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a stop in lox2272.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure. So the bicistronic construct has the ligand first, then the receptor. But how are the stop cassettes arranged?

So the vector is:

5' - CBA promoter - ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP cassette - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP - 3'

Wait, no, I think it's ligand ORF at 5', with a stop in a loxP cassette between ligand and mCherry. Then, after the stop, the IRES would come next. So after the ligand, the stop is in a loxP cassette, then IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, no, the question says: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. The receptor ORF is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP, and between it and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

Wait, so the structure would be:

Promoter (CBA) --> ligand ORF --> stop cassette (loxP) --> mCherry

Then, after that, IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP.

But wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So perhaps the construct is: after the ligand, the IRES is present, then the receptor.

Wait, the question states: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES.

So the vector must have CBA promoter driving the ligand, and then after the ligand, there's an IRES, which then allows for the receptor to be expressed. So the structure is:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry

IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop (lox2272) -> eGFP.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the IRES would come after the ligand.

Alternatively, maybe the vector has the CBA promoter driving a bicistronic mRNA that includes both the ligand and receptor, with the IRES allowing for translation of the receptor after the ligand.

But the ligand is at 5', then IRES, then receptor. Because the question says ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after IRES.

But the stop cassettes complicate things. So, for the ligand: after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry. For the receptor, after the receptor ORF, there's a stop in the lox2272 cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, but how does the IRES work here. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so perhaps after the ligand, after some elements, the IRES is placed, and then the receptor starts.

I think the actual structure (approximate) is:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry

IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

But how are these arranged on the vector? Because in a bicistronic vector, you have two ORFs in the same transcript. The promoter drives both, and the IRES allows the second ORF to be translated.

Wait, perhaps the setup is:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF (with a stop cassette after it) -> mCherry.

Then, after the ligand's stop cassette, the IRES is present, which then allows for the translation of the receptor followed by eGFP.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

But the main point is that the SOX10-Cre mice were crossed. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be active there, recombining the loxP sites.

Wait, but which lox sites are present? The ligand has a stop cassette with loxP-stop-loxP. The receptor has a stop with lox2272-stop-lox2272.

So, when Cre is introduced, it would recognize loxP sites. The lox2272 is a variant, which Cre can also recognize, but perhaps only when paired in a certain way? Or is lox2272 a different recombinase target?

Wait, loxP is the standard site for Cre. Lox2272 is a mutant lox site that is Cre-dependent but requires a different arrangement â€” I think it requires two lox2272 sites or a loxP and lox2272. Alternatively, I recall that lox2272 is a "floxed" site that Cre can recombine, but perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are different.

Wait, Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. lox2272 is a variant lox site, I believe, that is recognized by Cre as well. So in the presence of Cre, both loxP and lox2272 sites can be recombined.

But in the vector, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

When Cre is expressed, it would recombine these sites.

So, for the ligand: the stop cassette is flanked by loxP. When Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, removing the stop cassette, allowing expression of the ligand and mCherry.

Similarly, for the receptor, the stop cassette is flanked by lox2272. Cre would recombine those, removing the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but in the question, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. They crossed them to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre should be expressed in neural crest cells.

So, in the offspring, the Cre should have recombined the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing expression of both ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP).

But in the experiment, when they looked under the confocal, they didn't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed.

Why? Maybe the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed.

Option D says receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, when you have a stop cassette, and then a fusion protein. If the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, along with eGFP. But if the frame is wrong, perhaps the receptor ORF is not correctly in frame with eGFP.

Wait, the way it's constructed: the receptor ORF is at 3', and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor is probably expressed as a separate protein, and eGFP is a tag at the end.

Wait, unless the eGFP is in frame with the receptor. But if the stop cassette is lox2272, and when Cre removes it, the receptor is expressed along with eGFP. But if the eGFP is not in frame, the entire construct could be messed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette is in between the receptor and eGFP. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but if the stop is lox2272, and Cre deletes it, then the eGFP is expressed, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the vectors have the lox sites in a way that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression.

In the case of the ligand: the ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP. So the ligand is expressed only if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor's stop is a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, both stops are removed, leading to expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin, meaning the expression is happening. Wait, no, the question says that they tested the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection. So they transfected primary astrocyte cultures. The blot shows signals proportional to actin.

Wait, but the use of Cre in the transfection? Or perhaps they're talking about the mouse model.

Wait, maybe the vectors were transfected into the cells. The cells would have the construct, and without Cre, the stops are in place. But the question says they used Cre in the mouse model.

Wait, perhaps the initial problem is that the Cre wasn't expressed, so the stops weren't removed, so the proteins aren't expressed.

But in the mouse model, they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in neural crest cells.

But the question says they visualized the offspring under the confocal. So perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed.

Alternatively, the expression isn't happening because the frame is wrong.

Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So, perhaps after the stop is removed, the eGFP is not correctly in frame, so the entire construct is not translated.

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. So maybe the IRES isn't allowing the receptor's expression.

Wait, but the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the stops are present, so the ligand and receptor are not expressed. But when Cre is expressed, the stops are removed, so both are expressed.

But in the mouse, Cre is expressed in the neural crest, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed there. The eGFP should be expressed, so when they look under the microscope, they should see green.

But they don't. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they're secreted and act on neighboring cells. But the question is about their expression in the same cells. So if they are paracrine, maybe the ligand is secreted, and the receptor is on the surface. But why would that affect the eGFP expression? Maybe the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't, because somehow the expression is not happening.

But the Western blot was done after transfection, which showed signals. So perhaps the expression is correct.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the protein isn't trafficking properly. But why would that happen? If the stop is removed, the construct should be expressed, but perhaps the eGFP is misfolded. But the Western blot would show the protein, just maybe not in the right place.

But the question says that the blot shows signals proportional to actin. So if the total proteins have a signal, that implies that the proteins are present, so the eGFP is made. But maybe it's not trafficking to the cell surface, so it's not fluorescent under the confocal. But the question says they don't observe a green signal, so perhaps eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, maybe the stop is not correctly removed. The construct has a lox2272 stop cassette. Does Cre recognize lox2272?

Wait, I think lox2272 is a variant lox site that is recognized by Cre, but it's a "floxed" site. However, in some cases, lox2272 sites are used in pairs. Or perhaps the lox2272 is a 2272-derived site that recombines only when another lox2272 is present. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is not recognized by Cre. Or perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are different enough that Cre can't recombine them.

Wait, no, I think Cre can recombine lox2272 sites as well. But perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are different, so the Cre might not have the right sites to recombine.

In the vector, the ligand has a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, it will recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop for the ligand. But for the receptor, the lox2272 sites need to be recombined. But if the Cre can't recognize lox2272, or if the lox sites aren't correct, then the stop cassette for the receptor isn't removed, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

So in the mouse model, only the ligand's stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop isn't removed, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. Therefore, when they look for eGFP, they don't see it.

So that would explain why the green signal isn't present.

But wait, the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct. And the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. So in the offspring, they have two copies of the construct and one copy of Cre.

But if the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, then the receptor's stop isn't removed, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the stop cassette in the receptor isn't being removed because Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, which one explains this?

Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, so perhaps it doesn't need an enhancer. So this might not be the case.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that were the case, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the Western blot would show the receptor (as the eGFP might not be there). But the question says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin, which implies that the fusion proteins are expressed.

Wait, but maybe the stop for the receptor is in a lox2272 cassette, which Cre doesn't recognize. So the stop isn't removed. Thus, the receptor isn't expressed, so the eGFP isn't either. Hence, no green signal.

So which option aligns with this?

Option C is about enhancer missing. But the CBA promoter is strong, so maybe this isn't the issue.

Option B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. If that's the case, the protein would be present (so the blot would show it), but it wouldn't fluoresce. But the question says they don't see a signal, implying the eGFP isn't there at all.

So perhaps the stop for the receptor isn't removed, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. So why wouldn't the stop be removed?

Because the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined by Cre. So the problem is that the construct for the receptor isn't having the stop cassette removed.

But why wouldn't the stop be removed? Because the lox sites are wrong.

Wait, the lox sites are loxP and lox2272. Cre recognizes loxP sites, but maybe not lox2272. Wait, I thought Cre can recombine lox2272 sites as well. Or perhaps the lox2272 is a site that requires a different recombinase? No, I think Cre can handle lox2272.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox sites are in the same orientation, Cre might not recombine them properly. Or perhaps the vector uses a different arrangement.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 is a "conditional" site, meaning it requires another factor, but I don't think that's the case here.

Another angle: the presence of the IRES. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor won't be expressed. But the CBA promoter is driving the ligand, and the IRES is supposed to drive the receptor. If the IRES is faulty, then the receptor won't be expressed even after the stop is removed.

But the problem is that the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should have activated Cre in the neural crest, leading to the removal of the stop cassettes. So if the IRES is working, the receptor should be expressed.

Wait, but let's go back. The stop cassette for the ligand is loxP. So when Cre is present, that stop is removed, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. For the receptor, the stop is lox2272, and if Cre can't remove it, then the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

So the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But why? Because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272? Or perhaps the lox2272 sites are arranged in a way that prevents recombination.

Wait, I'm not certain about this. Another approach: which option fits this scenario?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame. If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a fusion, but the receptor might be expressed. But the Western blot would show the receptor, but perhaps the eGFP isn't visible. But the question states that the blot shows a signal proportional to actin. It's not clear if it's referring to mCherry and eGFP, or both.

Alternatively, the problem is that the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed. But IRES typically works regardless of the promoter.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 site isn't being recognized by Cre. So the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed, and thus eGFP isn't either.

Another thought: the vector might have a single loxP and a single lox2272 site. For Cre to delete the stop, it would need to recognize the lox2272 sites. If Cre can't, then the stop remains, and the receptor isn't expressed.

But I'm not exactly sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't in the right place. If the stop is after the receptor, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed. But if the eGFP is in the wrong frame, then no.

So, in that case, option D would apply. But I'm not sure if the frame is the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, eGFP is expressed. But if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the problem is that the stop isn't being removed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So which option explains this?

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But if the enhancer is missing, both wouldn't be expressed, but in reality, perhaps the ligand is expressed because the CBA promoter is strong. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Another possibility is that the IRES is not working. If the IRES is faulty, then even if the stop is removed, the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot might show the ligand but not the receptor.

But the question says that the blot shows signals proportional to actin loading. So perhaps the proteins are expressed.

Wait, maybe the stop is not correctly flanked. If the stop is not correctly placed, the removal doesn't allow for expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the loxP sites are inverted, Cre can't recombine them.

But the question says the lox sites are present. So, if the sites are correctly placed, but Cre can't recognize the lox2272, then the stop isn't removed.

But I'm not sure if Cre can't recognize lox2272.

In summary, the most likely reason for no eGFP signal is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being removed. If the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined, then the stop remains, and the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But why wouldn't the lox2272 sites be recombined? Perhaps because the Cre used isn't compatible with them.

Wait, I think lox2272 is a loxP variant that Cre can recombine. So perhaps the problem is that the construct has a loxP and lox2272, and Cre can't recombine them together. Because Cre typically acts on two loxP sites. lox2272 is a different site, requiring perhaps another type of Cre or a different setup.

Wait, no. lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site. The Cre recombinase can recognize and recombine lox2272 sites, but they have specific sequences. So if the construct has a lox2272 site and no other lox2272 or loxP site nearby, Cre might not be able to mediate recombination.

Wait, in the vector, perhaps the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP sites and the receptor's by lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it can only recombine the loxP sites, but not the lox2272 ones.

Thus, the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't because Cre can't recognize lox2272. Therefore, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. I think lox2272 is a 'floxed' site that Cre can recombine. So perhaps the problem isn't with the recognition, but with the orientation or presence of another site.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed with loxP and lox2272 in a way that the Cre cannot recombine the lox2272 site unless another site is present. But without that, no recombination occurs.

So, in the mouse, the ligand's stop is in loxP, which Cre can recombine, so ligand is expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, and Cre can't recombine it, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Thus, the answer would be that the stop isn't being removed because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre.

Looking back at the options, which one relates to the stop not being removed because of the site type.

Wait, the options don't directly address the lox2272 issue. So perhaps another approach.

If the eGFP isn't present, the construct isn't being expressed. So, perhaps the transcription of the vector isn't happening, but the CBA promoter should drive it.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette is preventing the expression of the receptor. But if the Cre isn't active, then the stop remains.

But in this case, the Cre is active in the neural crest cells.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette for the receptor is in the wrong place. If the stop is after the eGFP, then removing it would allow the eGFP to be expressed. But perhaps the construct is designed so that the eGFP is only expressed when the stop is removed.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. So without an enhancer, the promoter can't drive proper expression. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter. So probably, the ligand is expressed. The receptor is under IRES, which might not need an enhancer.

So perhaps option C isn't the reason.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, then eGFP isn't expressed. But the Western blot would still show the receptor, unless it's also affected.

Alternatively, the frame is wrong, so the receptor is not functional, but the eGFP isn't attached, so it doesn't fluoresce. But the blot would detect the receptor (as it's present) and perhaps the eGFP if it's expressed.

But the question is that the mouse has the construct, the Western blot (after transfection) shows signals. So perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed, but the receptor is.

But the question is about the mouse model, not the transfected cells.

Wait, the question states that after the mouse is born, they visualize under the confocal, so the expression is in the mouse.

But the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they saw the proteins. So in the plasmid, the construct is working, but in the mouse, it's not.

Hmm, possibly because the plasmid is expressing in a different context. Wait, but the plasmid is the same as the construct in the mouse. So why would it express in the plasmid but not in the mouse?

Ah, unless Cre is not present in the astrocyte culture. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, the Cre isn't present, so the stop cassettes aren't removed. But in the question, the Western blot shows signals that are proportional to actin, implying that the proteins are expressed. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the plasmid is a different construct. Or maybe I'm getting mixed up between the plasmid and the mouse construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid construct is the same as the one used in the mouse. So the expression in the plasmid suggests that the stops are being removed, perhaps because the plasmid is in a cell line that expresses Cre. But when they made the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't properly expressed.

But the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in the neural crest cells. So the Cre is present.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the SOX10-Cre isn't active, so Cre isn't expressed. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the mouse model has the construct under a promoter that doesn't require Cre, but that doesn't align with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed even when the stop is removed.

But I'm not certain.

Another approach: option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is out of frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the receptor may still be expressed, but as a separate protein. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce, but the receptor would be present.

But the Western blot would show the presence of the receptor, but perhaps the eGFP isn't present. But the question doesn't specify what the blot is detecting.

Wait, the question says they made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them on the Western blot. So the blot detects either the ligand, receptor, mCherry, or eGFP. If the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is, then the blot would show the receptor.

But in the mouse, if the eGFP isn't expressed, then no green signal. So the problem is specific to the eGFP.

So perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. Why? Because the stop is in lox2272, and Cre isn't recognizing it.

But I think Cre can recognize lox2272.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites are arranged in a way that Cre can't recombine them. For example, if they're in the same orientation, or if another site is present.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses a loxP and a lox2272 in a way that no recombination occurs. Or, perhaps the lox2272 sites are arranged in a way that they can't be recombined by Cre, but I'm not certain.

In that case, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the correct answer would be that the stop isn't being removed because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre. But none of the options directly state that.

Looking back, the options are:

A) paracrine relationship: unlikely to affect expression.

B) stuck in Golgi: would affect localization, but Western blot would show expression.

C) missing enhancer: but CBA is strong.

D) not in frame: would prevent eGFP expression.

But if the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is. So the blot would show the receptor protein, but not the eGFP.

But the question says that the blot after transfection shows a signal proportional to actin. It doesn't specify which protein, but perhaps both ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, but the receptor is. So in the blot, the receptor is detected, but the eGFP isn't.

But the question says that they don't see a green signal, implying that eGFP isn't present.

So, the reason could be that the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why isn't the stop removed? Because the lox2272 isn't being recombined.

But the options don't address this directly.

Another option: perhaps the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but the IRES is after the ligand. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor won't be expressed even when the stop is removed.

So, for the mouse, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But then, why would the Western blot show a signal? Because the ligand is under CBA and expressed.

So, the blot would detect the ligand, but not the receptor.

But the question doesn't specify which protein is detected. It says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin loading, which is just a loading control, so that shouldn't affect the result.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think of it differently.

If the Cre wasn't able to recombine the lox2272 sites, then the stop isn't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But the options don't have an option stating that.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is not correctly flanked, so the construct isn't functional.

But again, the options don't directly address that.

Looking for another angle, perhaps the vector was designed incorrectly. For example, the IRES is before the ligand, but that's not what the question states.

Wait, the question says the ligand is at 5', under CBA. The receptor is at 3', with IRES upstream.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand, so the receptor is expressed after the ligand. But the stops are in place.

When Cre is present, the stops are removed. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed.

But if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the stop isn't removed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not strong enough to drive the receptor's expression. But IRES are typically efficient.

Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is a C-terminal tag, so if the receptor isn't expressed, eGFP isn't either. But why?

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. I think the most plausible option based on the setup is that the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being removed because Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But since none of the options directly state this, I need to look for the closest fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is the frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, then it won't be expressed. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but the problem is the stop isn't removed, not the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in the wrong place, so when it's removed, the frame is correct for the receptor but not for eGFP. But I'm not sure.

Another point: the question says that the ligand is under CBA promoter. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand's stop is in place, so ligand isn't expressed. But when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, so ligand is expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), so the ligand should be expressed, along with the receptor.

But the blot after transfection in astrocytes showed signals. So perhaps in the mouse, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't.

So, the problem must be with the receptor's stop not being removed.

Thus, the most likely answer is that the stop isn't being removed because the lox2272 isn't being recognized by Cre. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the eGFP isn't in frame, then the receptor might be expressed (as the stop is removed), but eGFP isn't. So in the Western blot, the receptor would show up, but eGFP wouldn't. However, in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no green signal.

But the question says that the blot shows a signal proportional to actin. It doesn't specify which protein. So perhaps the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't.

In that case, the problem is with the receptor's expression.

So, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is after the ligand. So the CBA promoter should drive both ligand and receptor expression via the IRES.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand, but the stop cassette for the receptor is in the way. So without the stop being removed, the receptor isn't expressed.

But that brings us back to the stop cassette issue.

In the absence of the stop being removed, the receptor isn't expressed.

But why isn't the stop being removed? Because the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre.

But since the options don't directly state this, perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, but the receptor is. But the Western blot would detect the receptor.

But the question says that they do not observe a green signal, indicating that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is specifically with eGFP, not the receptor.

In that case, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, leading to no eGFP expression.

So the answer would be D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed because the lox2272 isn't recognized, but since that's not an option, I'll have to choose the best fit.

Another angle: perhaps the vector is such that the lox2272 sites are in a way that the stop isn't removed. For example, the stop cassette is in the same orientation as the ORF, so when Cre recombines, it deletes the stop, but if the sites are in reverse, it might not.

But I'm not sure.

In conclusion, after all this thinking, the most plausible answer is that the stop isn't being removed because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly state this.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the lox2272 sites might not have been excised because the construct wasn't properly designed. For example, the lox sites are in the same orientation, making recombination impossible.

But again, without knowing the specifics, it's hard.

I think the best fit among the options is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed, which would explain the lack of green signal.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with the ligand under the CBA promoter and the receptor under an IRES element. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette upstream, while the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette upstream. After crossing a mouse model homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, no green signal from eGFP was observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies that the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, while the receptor remains on the surface. However, this does not explain why eGFP is not expressed in the same cells where Cre is active (neural crest cells). The question focuses on the lack of eGFP expression, which is unrelated to the ligand-receptor interaction being paracrine. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were mislocalized to the Golgi, it would still be synthesized and detectable on a Western blot. However, the question specifies that no green signal was observed under confocal microscopy, suggesting that eGFP is not expressed at all. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression and is therefore unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. While the receptor relies on the IRES element, the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to prevent its expression entirely, especially since the IRES is designed to drive translation. Furthermore, the Western blot after transfection showed signals proportional to actin loading, indicating that at least the ligand and possibly other components were expressed. This option does not fully explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed as a fusion protein. This would result in no green signal under confocal microscopy, consistent with the observation. While the receptor might still be expressed as a separate protein, the lack of eGFP fluorescence aligns with this explanation. This is the most plausible option.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of a green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation that no green signal was detected under confocal microscopy.
