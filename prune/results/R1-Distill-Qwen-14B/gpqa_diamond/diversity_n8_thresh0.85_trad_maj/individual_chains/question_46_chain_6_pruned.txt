Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? So it's all about breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

Wait, let me think about the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene first. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl group on the third carbon. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2 (pent-1-ene). So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh wait, no, wait. No, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So for
