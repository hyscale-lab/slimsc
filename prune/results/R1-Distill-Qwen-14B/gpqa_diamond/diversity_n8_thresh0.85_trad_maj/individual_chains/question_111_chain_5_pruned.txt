Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The first reaction is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination or addition reaction. Oh wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated group. So maybe it's a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition?

Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives reacting with estersâ€”I think it's the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. Or wait, no, that's between two ketones. Oh, right, maybe it's a conjugate addition since the ketone could act as an electrophilic component.

The starting compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1, and substituents at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). So positions 2 and 6 are both substituted.

When reacting with ethyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOEt, the acrylate has a conjugated double bond. The reaction might proceed via a Michael addition where the enolate of the ketone attacks the acrylate. But wait, ketones can form enolates. So t-B
