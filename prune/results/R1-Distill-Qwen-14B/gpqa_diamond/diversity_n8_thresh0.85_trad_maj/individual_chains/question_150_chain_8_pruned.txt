Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions and NMR interpretations yet. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question gives a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and after a series of reactions, I need to figure out the final product from the options A to D.

Let me start by looking at the NMR data. The signals are:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H: That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H: This could be aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps two protons in a para-substituted ring, like two protons each coupling with one adjacent.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H: Also aromatic, maybe another para-substituted ring or perhaps another set of protons adjacent to substituents.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad signals are often from protons that are either in an acidic environment or maybe adjacent to an electronegative group. These could be vinyl protons or maybe something like an -OH group, but wait, OH protons are usually broader, but since it's a singlet and there are two H, maybe they're on a double bond. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents causing them to be deshielded.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H: This is a singlet with two H. Maybe this is a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. The doublet suggests coupling with another set of two protons. So perhaps OCH2CH2 something, but wait, the coupling here is 2H, so maybe it's linked to another CH2.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO: 

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde group (another double bond, so that's 2 so far, but wait, aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So maybe benzene (3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde (another 1?), but wait, the aldehyde is a carbonyl, which counts as one. Hmm, but 5 degrees: 3 from benzene, 1 from another double bond (maybe a double bond in a chain), and 1 from the carbonyl. So, perhaps a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR again, the 9.72 ppm is likely the aldehyde proton. The 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets suggest perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings. Wait, but with two doublets, each integrating to 2H, maybe it's two different benzene rings. Let me think, for example, if the molecule is a diaryl compound, each with a substituent.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe these are protons on a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system. For instance, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So like an enal, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So something like CH2=CHCHO or similar.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aldehyde is at 9.72, and the 6.27 is a broad singlet, 2H, perhaps the two protons on the double bond. So perhaps the structure has an aldehyde, a double bond, and two benzene rings attached?

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's compute the possible structure.

If the molecule is something like benzaldehyde with substituents, but given the NMR, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure would be Ph-C-CH2-CHO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe it's a diaryl-alkenal. Let's try to imagine.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like (Ph)2CHCH2CHO? But that might not
