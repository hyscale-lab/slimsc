Alright, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere depends on the temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation might be relevant here. 

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in a specific energy state to the temperature. The equation is something like N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where N_i and N_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, we're looking at the ratio of excitation levels. Let's say the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Since it's the same for both stars, the ratio between star_1 and star_2 would depend on their temperatures.

The problem says the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, let me denote the excitation as proportional to N_i, the number of atoms in the excited state. So, (N_1)/(N_2) = 2. Since the energy difference is the same, and assuming the ground state (or lower state) is the same, we can set up the ratio using the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, but the ratio of N_i to N_j would be proportional to exp( -(ΔE)/(k_B T) ), assuming E_j is the lower state. So for each star, we have their respective ratios.

So, for star_1: N1_j = (g1/gj) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )
Similarly, for star_2: N2_j = (g2/gj) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Wait, but the problem says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So, I think the ratio is N1/N2 = 2. Wait, but N is the number in the excited state, right? So, let's assume that the lower state is the same for both, so the ratio would be N1/N2 = [ (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ].

Wait, wait, maybe I should think of it as N_i/N_j for each star. Let me clarify. Let’s say for each star, the excitation ratio between the upper level (i) and lower level (j) is given. For star_1, this ratio is N_i1/N_j1, and for star_2, it's N_i2/N_j2. The problem says N_i1/N_j1 = 2 * (N_i2/N_j2). So, the ratio is twice as high for star_1.

But wait, the problem says the atoms in star_1
