Okay, so I have this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me phase shifts for different l values and asks me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts, especially in partial wave analysis.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. The formula I think is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδl} sinδl ) * Pl(cosθ) ), right? Here, k is the wave number, and the sum is over all the partial waves l.

But wait, the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, the incident beam direction would be along the initial direction of the electrons. So when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees, because that's when the electron is moving along its original path, directionally.

So, putting θ = 0 into the formula. Let me see, Pl(cos0) is Pl(1). But what's Pl(1)? Oh, right, Pl(1) is 1 for all l because the Legendre polynomial evaluated at 1 is 1.

So for each term in the sum, the Pl(cosθ) becomes 1. Then the amplitude f(0) becomes (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδl} sinδl ), because sinδl is the imaginary part of e^{iδl}, right?

Wait, more accurately, e^{iδl} = cosδl + i sinδl. So the imaginary part of e^{iδl} is sinδl. So when we take the imaginary part of the entire amplitude, we need to compute Im[f(0)].

So Im[f(0)] would be (1/(2k)) * Σ ( (2l +1) sinδl ) * Im[e^{iδl}]? Or wait, no, because the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up steps.

Wait, the full expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl * Pl(cosθ) ]? No, wait. Let me think again. Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl multiplied by Pl(costheta). Because e^{iδl} = cosδl + i sinδl, so when you expand f(θ), the real part comes from the real component and the imaginary part from the imaginary component. So the imaginary part of f(theta) is (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sinδl Pl(cosθ) ].

But since we're evaluating at theta=0, Pl(cos0)=1, so Im[f(0)] is (1/(2k)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδl ].

Wait, but the original formula for f(theta) is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl * Pl(costheta) ]. So perhaps the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sinδl * Pl(costheta) ].

So yes, for theta=0, Pl(1)=1, so Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sinδl.

Now, what are the given phase shifts? The problem states δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55, δ3=30°, δ4=13°, and to ignore the rest. So I guess these correspond to l=0,1,2,3,4.

So, for each l, compute (2l+1)*sin(δl in radians), then sum them up.

Wait, but wait, the angles are given in degrees, so I need to convert them to radians before taking the sine.

Alternatively, perhaps in calculation, it's easier to compute sin in degrees if I can, but I think the problem expects me to use radians.

So let's list the given delta_l and compute each term:

l=0: delta=90°, sin(90°)=1. So term: (2*0 +1)*1 = 1*1 =1.

l=1: delta=67°, sin(67). Let's compute that. 67 degrees in radians is approx 1.16937 radians. But perhaps it's easier to compute sin(67°). Well, sin(67) is about 0.9205.

So term: (2*1+1)*0.9205 = 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: delta=55°, sin(55)≈0.8192. So term: 5 * 0.8192 ≈ 4.096.

l=3: delta=30°, sin(30)=0.5. Term:7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4: delta=13°, sin(13)≈0.22495. Term: (2*4 +1)=9 → 9 * 0.22495 ≈ 2.02455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 (l=0) + 2.7615 (l=1) +4.096 (l=2) +3.5 (l=3) +2.02455 (l=4) =

Let me add step by step.

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096=7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.38205.

Now, the formula says Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) * sum.

But wait, what is k here? k is the wave number. The electrons have 50 MeV energy. So we need to compute k.

The energy E is 50 MeV. Electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the kinetic energy is significant compared to the rest mass, so we can't neglect it. So relativistic considerations are needed.

The relation between energy and wave number is from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

We can write E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

But since E is given in MeV, and m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e c^2. So perhaps we can use a non-relativistic approximation, but let me check.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic limit, E ≈ pc, but when E is much larger than m_e c^2, then p ≈ E/(c). So in
