Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question says: there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds, right? Because at high speeds, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, because in classical mechanics, you'd just say 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but relativity doesn't work that way.

So the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug the numbers in. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Wait, so that's (0.3c²)/(c²) = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c. So about 0.143c. Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and D also 0.14c. Hmm, so both C and D have the same relative speed. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So that part narrows it down to options C and D.

Now the second part: the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate the energy for each and add them.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute for each astronaut.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for him: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * m c². Wait, but wait, the mass is 2m, so let me correct that. Oh right, the energy is gamma times the rest mass energy, which is (gamma * m_rest) c². So mass is 2m, so energy E1 = gamma * (2m) c².

Gamma here is 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for him: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt
