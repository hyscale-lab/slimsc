Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the question says that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, I think. So, the atomic number for lithium is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. So, protons in Li are 3, because atomic number is 3. So, 3 protons +3 neutrons = mass number 6. That makes it Li-6, right?

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, the energy of the nucleus when moving at a certain speed. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. So, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

The formula is E = gamma * m0c², where m0 is the rest mass. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, the speed given is 0.96c. So v = 0.96c. Let me compute gamma for that speed.

Calculating gamma:
v = 0.96c
v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c²
So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) is... let's see, 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. Yeah, so gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. I need to find the rest mass of Li-6.

The rest mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass defect formula, but wait, alternatively, I can use the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is known. Let me think... I remember that for hydrogen, the mass is about 1.007825 u per proton, and for neutrons, it's about 1.008665 u each. But wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, considering that the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons, so the mass number is 6. So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, I think the exact values are: proton is 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². Let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic mass in atomic mass units (u) and then convert to energy.

Wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy, but wait, no, the actual atomic mass includes electrons as well. Hmm, wait no, the atomic mass includes electrons but for a nucleus, we're considering just the protons and neutrons. Wait, but when you have a nucleus, you have a certain binding energy, but perhaps for an approximate calculation, I can just sum the masses.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to look up the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as approximately the sum of the individual nucleons.

But wait, Li-6 nucleus: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, each proton is about 938 MeV/c², each neutron is about 939 MeV/c².

So, the rest mass m0 would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) = 3*(938 + 939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV/c².

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 3 protons: 3 * 938.272 ≈ 2814.816 MeV. 3 neutrons: 3 * 939.565 ≈ 2818.695 MeV. So total is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but wait—does that make sense? Because the binding
