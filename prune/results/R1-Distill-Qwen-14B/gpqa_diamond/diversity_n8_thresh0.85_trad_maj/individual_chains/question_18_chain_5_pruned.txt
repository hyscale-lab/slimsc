Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember that [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So, like, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y / (n_X_sun/n_Y_sun)).

The problem gives me the masses of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, which are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, I'm not sure if the masses matter here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Maybe the mass affects the abundances through some other process, but since the problem is giving us the elemental abundances, perhaps the masses aren't directly needed for the calculation. I'll keep that in mind.

So the given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times the ratio in the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg to Si in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Mg to H in Star_2 is same as in the Sun.

Wait, but H is involved here. The Sun's composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 => log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12+log(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH)= -5, so nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, let me compute that. For the Sun:
nFe/nH = 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5) = approximately 3.16e-5.
nMg/nH = 10^(7 -12) = 10^(-5) = 1e-5.

But wait, in the Sun, what about nSi/nH? I don't have that directly. But maybe I can find it using the given ratios.

First, let's tackle Star_1. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means Fe/H in Star_1 is same as Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Wait, but the Sun's nFe/nH is given, so Star_1's Fe/H is the same. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Which is 3.16e-5 as before.

But wait, the problem says [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so their ratio is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1,
