Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. Okay, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Let's go through it step by step.

So, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait a second, the wave function usually has to satisfy certain conditions, right? Like, it needs to be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. Oh right, because probabilities can't exceed 1 or be negative.

The problem states that when they measured the position of the particles, all were found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is non-zero only in that region. That makes sense because if the wave function is zero outside that interval, the probability of finding the particle there would be zero. So, I think the wave function has to be zero outside x=1 to x=3. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that. Perhaps the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or maybe it's a complex number where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh okay, so the wave function is a complex function. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or wait, no, maybe it's written as (a/sqrt(1+x) ) minus 0.5i, meaning the entire term is a complex number. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or wait, maybe the entire (a/sqrt(...)) is a complex number? That doesn't make much sense because the way it's written as (a/sqrt(...)) - 0.5i suggests that.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on that. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (-0.5i), but that's not how it's written either. Alternatively, maybe it's a + b i, where a is a/sqrt(1+x) and b is -0.5
