Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism has something to do with molecules having the ability to rotate plane-polarized light. Oh right, it's because of the presence of chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are nitro groups at 6,6' and carboxylate groups at 2,2'. I'm trying to visualize if this molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, biphenyl can have different conformations, but in this case, the substituents are in positions that might lead to asymmetry. If the substituents are in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement allows for enantiomers. But I'm a bit unsure. I think biphenyl systems can sometimes have axial chirality, especially if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetric. So this one might have optical isomerism.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but then the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Is there a chiral center here? Let's see. The carbons are: the COOCH3 is on the third carbon. The second carbon has the hydroxyl. So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, the middle carbon (CH2) would have two CH2 groups, a hydroxyl, and a COOCH3 group. Oh wait, no. The structure is probably CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So that's:

Carbon 1: CH3 (from CH2COO)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to hydroxyl and another CH2
Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be:

HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 esterified with methyl
