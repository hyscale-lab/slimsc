Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it says. We're diluting acetic acid with water and then titrating it with NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh right, I remember that pH calculations involve understanding the equivalence point and buffer solutions.

Alright, let's break it down. So, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're adding 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be half of 0.05 M. Let me calculate that: 0.05 / 2 is 0.025 M. So diluted concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Wait, wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, NaOH is a strong base. So at equivalence, the moles of NaOH would neutralize the acetic acid, producing acetate ions.

Let me find the moles first. Initial moles of acetic acid: volume (cm³) is 20, so 0.020 L. Molarity is 0.05 M. Moles = M * V = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

When we dilute with 20 cm³ (0.02 L), the concentration is 0.025 M, but the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the moles of acetic acid are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Oh wait, same as before because 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, and 0.025 * 0.04 is also 0.001. Makes sense.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid. Moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So first, let's calculate the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³ added. So in the solution, some of the acetic acid will have been neutralized to acetate.

So, the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution. Because before the equivalence point, some of the acid is neutralized. So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Let me think about the moles. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 25% of 0.001 mol is neutralized. So moles of HA (acetic acid) = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of A- (acetate) = 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume is the initial solution plus the added NaOH. Initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Then, adding 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of NaOH, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So, the concentrations are:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.
[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should calculate it exactly. Let's compute the exact numbers.

Molarity of HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.
Molarity of A-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So let's calculate pKa:

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

So [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. The log of 0.333 is about -0.477. So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So around 4.26.

Wait, but wait, what about the total dilution? Because the solution is at 25% of the equivalence point, but when you add NaOH, the volume increases, which affects both HA and A- concentrations. But in the Henderson equation, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (moles A-)/(moles HA), because the same volume dilutes both equally, so the ratio remains the same as moles ratio. So the volume might not matter in the ratio.

Wait, right! Because both HA and A- are in the same solution, their concentrations are divided by the same volume. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (n_A-)/(n_HA) where n is moles. So I can compute the ratio as moles.

So moles HA = 0.00075 mol, moles A- = 0.00025 mol. So ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is approximately -0.477.

Thus, pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256, which is around 4.26. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

Now, what about equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution contains acetate ions (A-) and the solution is basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

So, the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate (NaA) in water. Since NaOH is a strong base, it dissociates completely, so the acetate comes from the salt.

So, we need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions. Let's find the moles of acetate.

At equivalence, moles of acetate = moles of acetic acid initially = 0.001 mol.

The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is a weak base. It will hydrolyze in water:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-

The Kb for A- can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Since Ka * Kb = Kw (1e-14 at 25°C), Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is about 5.405e-10. Now, the solution is 0.02 M A-.

To find the pH, we can set up the equation for Kb.

Let's denote [OH-] as x. So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M. Now, pOH is -log(3.288e-6).

Let's compute that. Log(3.288) is about 0.516. Log(1e-6) is -6. So pOH is 5.484. Therefore, pH is 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516.

Hmm, around 8.52. So the equivalence pH is approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when you add NaOH to acetic acid, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. The solution at equivalence is a solution of the conjugate base (acetate) in water, which will hydrolyze as I did. So the pH should be around 8.52.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that would match what I have here.

But wait, let me double-check the equivalence point calculation.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. Volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

Setting up Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] → approx OH- is sqrt(0.02 * Kb).

So sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6, as before.

pOH ≈ 5.484, so pH ≈ 8.516, which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence pH is 8.52.

So, putting it together, 25% titration pH is ~4.26, equivalence is ~8.52. So the answer should be A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57; 6.92. Are there any miscalculations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water, so total 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution is (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40 * 0.05 → wait, no, 20/40 is 0.5, so 0.05 * 0.5 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol. So moles HA = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles A- = 0.00025. Correct.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log( (0.00025)/(0.00075) )

Which is pKa + log(1/3) → 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.2
