Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change, ΔH, is usually measured in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) and is exothermic, so it should be negative.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I think I need to figure out how they react when mixed. Let me write down the given data.

HCl: Volume is 500 mL, concentration 0.2 M. So moles of HCl would be 0.2 * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, providing H+ and Cl- ions.

H2SO4: Volume 300 mL, 0.3 M. Moles would be 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In its first dissociation, it releases 2 H+ ions per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. So 0.09 moles would give 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: Volume 200 mL, 0.5 M. So moles are 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba²+ and OH- ions. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 moles would give 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically around -57 kJ/mol (but sometimes in kcal, about -2.79 kcal/mol, but I'm not sure about the exact value here). I think the problem expects me to use that value as a standard.

Wait, but wait—there's more than one acid and one base. How do they react together? Let me think about the possible reactions.

HCl is a monoprotic acid. Each mole provides one H+. H2SO4, as a diprotic acid, in the first dissociation gives two H+ per mole. Ba(OH)2 is a base that provides two OH- per mole.

So when these are mixed, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+
H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+ (since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+)
Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2 gives OH-: 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but for neutralization, the H+ and OH- will combine in a 1:1 ratio. So which is the limiting reactant?

H+ available: 0.28 mol
OH- available: 0.2 mol

So OH- is the limiting reagent. It will all react, and some H+ will be left.

So the amount of water formed is 0.2 mol H2O.

But wait, no, because each neutralization produces one H2O per H+ and OH-.

So the moles of H2O produced are 0.2 mol.

Hmm, but also, what about the excess H+? After neutralization, the excess H+ will remain in solution, so the solution will be acidic. But when calculating the enthalpy change for neutralization, I think only the amount that reacts contributes to the enthalpy.

So the enthalpy released would be based on the moles of H+ that reacted, which is 0.2 mol.

Wait, but wait. Another way: the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, ΔH = -57 k
