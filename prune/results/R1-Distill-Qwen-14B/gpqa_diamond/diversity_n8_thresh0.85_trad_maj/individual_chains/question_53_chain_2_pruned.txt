Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- or more likely an ester like R-O-CO-O-R? Wait, no, esters are usually RCOOR', right. So the IR peak suggests an ester functional group.

The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break that down. Two are aromatic protons, two are vinyl (so probably something like a double bond, maybe in a substituent), and two are methyl groups (-CH3). No signals for -CH2 groups, which implies that there are no methylene groups in the structure. So all the carbons that aren't in the rings or ester groups are either CH3 or maybe some other groups without CH2.

So the molecule is a di-substituted benzene (so two substituents on the ring). Let me think about possible structures. Since there's an ester group, one substituent is likely an ester. But wait, di-substituted would mean two substituents, both possibly being esters? Or one ester and another group.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for methyl groups. So maybe one substituent is an ester with two methyl groups? Like maybe a methyl ester attached to the ring, and another substituent that also has methyl groups. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OAc) and another is something else.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. For example, maybe the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, say OAc (acetate), which would bring in a methyl group from the acetate. But then where are the other methyl groups?

Wait, in the NMR, there are two signals for -CH3. So perhaps each of these is a different environment. Maybe one is from an ester's methyl, and the other is from another group, like a CH3 attached to the ring or part of a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group with a methyl attached, but that seems a bit unclear.

Wait, the vinyl-Hs are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests maybe a trans configuration or some coupling between the protons.

Hmm, let's try to think about the possible structure.

The benzene ring is di-substituted. One substituent is an ester group. Let's say, for example, para substitution with an ester group. Wait, but di-substituted could be para, meta, or ortho. The NMR has two aromatic protons, so perhaps the substituents are in a position that leads to two types of aromatic protons.

Wait, benzene rings with two substituents: if it's para, then the two substituents are across from each other, and the ring would have four equivalent H's if the substituents are the same. But in this case, the substituents are different because one is an ester and maybe another is a vinyl group or something else. So in that case, if the two substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would have two sets: the two adjacent to substituent A and the
