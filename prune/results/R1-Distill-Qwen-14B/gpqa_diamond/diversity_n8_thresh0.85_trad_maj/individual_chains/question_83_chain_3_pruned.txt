Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think it through.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka given is 1.85x10^-5.

Alright, first, I should figure out what's happening at each of these points. Let's start by calculating the initial concentrations after dilution.

Wait, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. So the initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, right? So the new concentration would be (volume1 * concentration1) / (volume1 + volume2). So that's (20 * 0.05) / 40. Let me do that: 20 *0.05 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me compute the moles first.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = moles/volume(L). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's calculate the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Starting with 25% titration: it's before the equivalence point, so it's a buffer solution. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. So, moles of acetic acid initially (after dilution) is 0.001 moles. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles reacting. Moles remaining of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025.

But wait, the total volume when you add 2.5 cm³ NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution? So total volume becomes 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425. Hmm, 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. 7.5e-4 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.0
