Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then figuring out the final product from the options given.

First, let me parse the question. Compound X has IR and NMR data. Then it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride, but wait, or is it maybe something else? Oh wait, another reaction I recall is the Cleve elimination. Or maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester? Hmm, maybe I should think about what each reagent does.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI is usually a situation where we're dealing with a substitution reaction, perhaps. Oh, wait, maybe it's for the elimination of HX from an ester. Alternatively, I think that when you have an ester reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it might be an example of the hydrolysis of an ester, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the Cleve elimination, where an acid chloride is treated with a phosphorus reagent to form an acid.

Wait, alternatively, another reaction comes to mind. Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides. Wait, no, that's usually with H2O. Or maybe it's used in the formation of a carbonyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's for the conversion of an acid bromide to an acid. Or wait, maybe it's the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an ester. Wait, but then why would you use red phosphorus and HI? Hmm.

Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of an acid bromide. Wait, no, maybe that's more for preparing the acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the preparation of a Grignard reagent? Or maybe the substitution of an acyloxy group?

Wait, maybe I should look at the IR and NMR data first to figure out what compound X is. Then I can think about what reaction it undergoes.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad peak, probably due to O-H stretching in a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid or an ester. Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group. So 1720 is likely an ester (around 1740 for esters maybe) or a ketone. Wait, 1720 is more like a ketone, or perhaps an ester. Wait, but wait, I also see a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so we can expect an aromatic ring in the compound.

So putting that together: compound X has a carbonyl group (either ester or ketone or acid) and an aromatic ring. The IR also has a broad peak, which might be an -OH, like from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait: the 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region, which can include both O-H and N-H (but probably O-H here). So, if there's a broad peak around that area and a carbonyl at 1720, that could suggest a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch, and the carbonyl is around 1700. So that might be the case.

Looking at the NMR data: the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, integrating for 1H. That's a very high chemical shift, which matches a carboxylic acid proton. So if that's present, then compound X is a carboxylic acid. But wait, wait—if X is a carboxylic acid, then when reacting with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Because I thought that when you have an acid chloride, you can hydrolyze it with H2O to make a carboxylic acid. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, then what's the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. Let me think. If X is an ester, and it's treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the Cleve elimination. The Cleve elimination involves the cleavage of an ester to form an acid. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an ester under acidic conditions. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI might be for another purpose.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI could be used to eliminate HX from an ester. For example, if the ester is something like R-O-CO-R', then under certain conditions, it might eliminate to form a ketone or something else. Or perhaps it's a type of elimination reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, maybe X has a leaving group that's being replaced by HI. Hmm, but without knowing the structure, it's a bit tricky.

Let me look again at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → probably a carboxylic acid -OH proton (but wait, in D2O, it would exchange and not appear, but perhaps in the sample, it's still present? Or maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but 10.5 is more like a carboxylic acid or maybe an aromatic OH. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, but I don't see any other peaks near that.)

Wait, wait, no, an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, but a carboxylic acid is even higher, like 10-12 ppm. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde? But in that case, the IR wouldn't have a broad peak. Wait, the IR shows 3400–2500, which is broader and could be a carboxylic acid's O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alcohol, but that's less likely because the O-H in alcohols is usually less broad, and the 1720 cm-1 would not fit.

Wait, maybe it's an ester. Then, the 1720 cm-1 would be the ester carbonyl. But then the O-H peak would be from something else, like an alcohol or a phenol. Hmm. Let's think about the NMR.

The NMR has a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, like a para-disubstituted benzene. So perhaps it's a para-substituted phenyl group attached to something.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton, but then the IR wouldn't be right. Alternatively, maybe that's a phenolic OH. But if it's a phenol, the IR might not have the broad O-H. Wait, but phenols have O-H stretches around 3300-3500 usually, which is in the 3400-2500 region. So maybe that's the case.

Wait, but then the 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl. So if there's a carbonyl and a phenol group, perhaps X is a phenyl ester? Or maybe a benzophenone with a substituent.

Wait, but let's look at all the NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → maybe aldehyde? Or maybe a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic protons, perhaps para to a substituent.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → same, so likely a para-substituted benzene.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → maybe a CH adjacent to something, like a CH2 or CH next to a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → perhaps a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or an oxygen.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → a terminal CH3, like an ethyl group.

Putting that together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a chain leading to a carbonyl group. Let's try to piece it together.

So, the aromatic region suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. So perhaps two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring.

Looking at the non-aromatic signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → perhaps a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Like R-CO-CH2-CH2-something.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the substituents.

If the benzene is para-substituted, perhaps it has a group like -OOCR (ester) or -COOR, where R is an alkyl chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone attached to the benzene. Wait, but how would that fit with the other signals.

Wait, let me try to build the structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. One is a chain leading to a carbonyl group, and the other substituent is another group. Or perhaps the substituent is in one position, and the other signals come from the chain.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a doublet, which suggests it's attached to a CH2 group, perhaps. Or wait, a CH group attached to a CH3.

Wait, another thought: the 1.4 ppm d, 3H could be a methyl group attached to a CH2. For example, an ethyl group, where the CH2 is next to a CH. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, perhaps it's a branching point.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone.

If that's the case, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent like -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to figure out what the substituent is.

Looking again, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Maybe that's the central CH in an isobutyl group or something similar. Let's see.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two Hs from a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.9 ppm would be the CH next to that CH2. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to the CH. So, something like CH(CH2CH3)-CO-... Wait, or perhaps CH(CH2CH3) attached to something else.

Wait, I'm trying to think of a group where there's a CH with a neighboring CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, maybe it's a (CH2) group in between.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the rest is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but let me think step by step.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester (around 1740) or a ketone (around 1700). Let's see, if it's a ketone, the 1720 is a bit high, but possible. Alternatively, the 1720 could be an ester.

If it's an ester, then there would be an OR group attached to a carbonyl. But where would that be?

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to something else.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak. If that's a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an aldehyde, but then the IR wouldn't fit. Alternatively, it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe X is a phenyl ester. For example, something like benzyl acetate. But wait, the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a ketone, along with another group.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzoate ester. So, the benzene ring has an ester group attached, like O-CO-R.

But then, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at around 1740, but the given is 1720, which is a bit lower, so maybe it's a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a ketone substituent, such as acetophenone. But in that case, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700, which matches 1720 pretty well. But then, what about the 10.5 ppm peak?

Wait, acetophenone doesn't have an -OH group, so that 10.5 peak must be something else. Maybe it's a methyl group attached in a way that creates a coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a propionyl group attached, like benzene with a CH2CH2COOH group? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see which structures fit the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Hmm. So options B and D are substituted toluenes (benzene with substituents). Options A and C are benzoic acids with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would likely be a carboxylic acid's -OH if any of the options are a benzoic acid. For example, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a carboxylic acid group, which would explain the 10.5 ppm peak and the 1720 cm-1 (as a carbonyl).

But wait, the 1720 is more typical of an ester or ketone. Wait, a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700, so 1720 is a bit higher but within the range.

If X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI—what would happen?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are often used for the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Alternatively, in the case of acid chlorides, red phosphorus can be used to prepare the acid. Wait, but if X is already the acid, then perhaps the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, maybe X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. So, for example, if X is an ester, like methyl benzoate, treating it with HI and red phosphorus might not directly convert it, but perhaps under acidic conditions, the ester could hydrolyze. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another thought: the reaction of a benzyl ester with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of a benzyl iodide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about eliminating a leaving group. Wait, maybe X is a bromide or chloride attached to a carbonyl group, so when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it eliminates to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is an acyl bromide or chloride, and red phosphorus and HI are used to convert it into the acid. Because I think that when acid chlorides (RCOCl) are treated with red phosphorus and water, they form the carboxylic acid. So, if X is an acid chloride, then upon reaction with HI, perhaps it's hydrolyzed to the acid.

Wait, but I'm not sure if HI is a good nucleophile for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, let me think about the structures. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the IR and NMR would fit. The 10.5 ppm would be the carboxylic acid proton, but in reality, carboxylic acids are usually deprotonated in DMSO (the solvent for NMR), so maybe that peak is not from the acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI. I think that when an ester is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can undergo cleavage to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', the reaction might cleave to form RCOOH and R'OH. But then, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, wait, another reaction: the hydrolysis of an ester using HI and red phosphorus. I think that in such conditions, the ester is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid. So, if X is an ester, then the product would be the corresponding acid.

Looking back at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, so perhaps X is the ester form of that acid, and upon reaction, becomes the acid.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show any ester oxygen adjacent protons. Let me see: in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. If that's a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group (like in a ketone or ester), then perhaps the structure includes a chain like CH2COOR or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a phenyl group with a substituent that includes an ester.

Wait, maybe I should sketch possible structures. Let me try to imagine the structure based on the NMR.

The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, so perhaps the substituent is attached at the para position. Then, the substituent is connected to a chain.

The non-aromatic protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → perhaps a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → CH3 attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → another CH3 attached to the CH2.

So, putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOR. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2COOH group, but that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the substituent on the benzene ring.

Assuming the substituent is a CH2 connected to a carbonyl group, perhaps as in RCOCH2Ph, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, maybe it's like CH(CH3)CH2... something.

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, which might be the CH group next to the carbonyl. So, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3). Or wait, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CO-... no, that would be more like an ester.

Wait, but let me think about the total integration. The NMR has:

1H at 10.5,

2H at 8.0,

2H at 7.2,

1H at 2.9,

2H at 1.7,

3H at 1.4,

3H at 0.9.

Total H: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3=14 H. So, the molecular formula must have 14 H. Let's see the options.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure: benzene ring with ethyl group in para position, and a propanoic acid substituent. The formula would be C11H14O2. Hydrogens: benzene ring (5 H if substituents are in para) but wait, for 4-ethylphenyl, the substituents are ethyl and propanoic acid. Wait, no, wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the structure where the benzene is attached to the second carbon of propanoic acid. So, the benzene is at position 4 of ethyl, and the acid is on the adjacent carbon.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of H for each option.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed by considering the reaction.

Assuming that X is an ester, and upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So, the product would be the acid.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So, perhaps X is the corresponding ester, which upon hydrolysis becomes the acid.

Alternatively, if X is an acid chloride, the reaction would produce the acid.

Wait, but if X is an ester, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not hydrolyze it to the acid. I thought that for ester hydrolysis, you usually use aqueous conditions. Red phosphorus and HI might be more for acid chlorides.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a benzyl chloride or similar, and the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the options and see which one could be the product after the reaction.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is an ester, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid.

But I'm not exactly sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of an acyl chloride to form the acid. So, if X is an acyl chloride, then the reaction would produce the acid.

Wait, but in that case, the initial compound X would have a structure like RCOCl. Then, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it would form RCOOH.

So, if the product is RCOOH, which is option C, then X would be RCOCl, which upon hydrolysis would yield RCOOH.

But then, what would the NMR of X (RCOCl) look like? Well, RCOCl typically doesn't have a broad O-H peak, because it's an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. So the IR of X would have a peak around 1800 cm-1 for the carbonyl, but in the given IR, the carbonyl is at 1720. So perhaps it's not an acid chloride.

Wait, maybe X is an ester. Let's say it's RCOOR'. Then, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes cleavage to form RCOOH.

So, for example, if X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then upon reaction, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, let's check the NMR data. If X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show the ester protons, like the OCH3 as a singlet, but I don't see any singlet in the given data. The closest is 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a triplet, likely an ethyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is ethyl or another type. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent includes a longer chain.

Wait, but the NMR data has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is probably from a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI: another possibility is that X is a bromide or chloride attached to a carbonyl group, perhaps an acyloxy group. For example, if X is an acyl bromide, then the reaction would produce the acid.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress, so perhaps I should go back to the NMR data and try to fit it to the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The benzoic acid's NMR would have the COOH proton at around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak. The aromatic region would have two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which matches the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals, suggesting a para-substituted benzene.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent would be a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring in the para position.

Wait, but how does that match the non-aromatic NMR signals?

The sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So, the protons on the CH2 would be near 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH(CH2CH3) would have a proton at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). The CH3 attached to the CH would be a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), but wait, in a sec-butyl group, the branching is at the second carbon.

Wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-Ph. So, the CH2 (attached to the benzene) would have protons. The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would have one proton. The CH2CH3 would have three protons.

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (next to benzene) would be a quartet or multiplet around 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH (CH(CH2CH3)) would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The CH2CH3 would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm (3H).

Additionally, the CH(CH2CH3) has a CH3 attached, which would be a doublet (coupled with the CH) around 1.4 ppm (3H). That matches the NMR data.

So, the non-aromatic protons in the NMR fit the structure of a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. The aromatic protons are para-disubstituted, so the substituents are in the para positions.

So, the structure of X must be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Wait, but then what is the reaction? X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. If X is already a carboxylic acid, why would it react with HI and red phosphorus? That doesn't make sense. Unless the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid. So, if X is the ester form of option C, then the product would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps X is another structure that upon reaction forms option C.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid chloride, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid. But then, the IR of X would show a carbonyl around 1800 cm-1, but the given is 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but that's not matching the IR data.

Alternatively, maybe X is an aldehyde. But the NMR data at 10.5 ppm would fit, but the IR would have a peak around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which I don't see here.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the IR doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is the corresponding ester, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate methyl ester, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze the ester to the acid. So, the product would be option C.

But then, what would the NMR of the ester look like? Let's see:

The ester would have a methyl group as OCH3. So, in the NMR, there should be a singlet around 3.8 ppm for the OCH3. But in the given data, the closest is 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet, not a singlet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is ethyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then the ester would have an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to the oxygen. The NMR would show a quartet around 4.2 ppm for the OCH2CH3, but that's not present here. So that doesn't fit.

So, perhaps X is not an ester but a carboxylic acid. Then, what would the reaction with red phosphorus and HI do?

Wait, another reaction: maybe X is an acid bromide. So, RCOBr. Then, treating it with HI and red phosphorus would replace the Br with I, making RCOI, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if X is an aryl bromide, but that's less likely.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction is something that doesn't change it, but that can't be right because the question says it reacts.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into the acid, so the product is option C.

But then, the NMR of X would have to match that of an ester. Let me think: if X is an ester, then the 10.5 ppm peak would not be present because the carboxylic acid would be an ester, not an acid. So the 10.5 would have to be something else.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is from an aldehyde proton. Then, X would be a benzaldehyde derivative, but that doesn't fit with the rest of the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is an exchangeable proton, like an -OH from an alcohol or phenol.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1, which would correspond to O-H stretching. So, if X is a phenol, then that would explain the broad peak. But then the 1720 cm-1 would have to be a carbonyl group attached to the phenol, perhaps as a ketone.

Wait, but then the structure would be a phenyl ketone, like acetophenone with a substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative with a substituent that includes a chain leading to another carbonyl group. But I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, perhaps this is taking too long. Let me consider the options again.

The product after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is one of the options A-D.

Option C is a benzoic acid. If the reaction produces a benzoic acid, then X must have been an ester or an acid chloride.

But looking at the NMR data, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. The substituent has a chain with a CH2 group, a CH group, and a methyl group.

Given that, the substituent is likely a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

Putting this together, the structure would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions.

So, X could be the ester version of option C, and upon reaction, it becomes the acid.

But then, the NMR of the ester would have to fit the data, but I don't see where the ester protons would be.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is 3H, so that must be a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH group. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is that CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H) is the CH2 group next to the benzene.

So, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? No, because the 1.4 is a doublet (so only one neighboring group), meaning it's attached to one CH (the CH2 would have two neighbors).

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH group. The 2.9 is that CH group, which is connected to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H). The CH2 is connected to the benzene. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, that would be a propyl group with a branch. But wait, the substituent is on the benzene, so it's in the para position. So the structure is benzene with a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group? No, wait, the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, let me count the carbons. Benzene ring, then substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, that would be a sec-butyl group.

Ah, yes, so the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure is benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR should show the substituent as a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent's protons would be as follows:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene) would be a quartet (if coupled with another CH2), but the given data has 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which is a multiplet, perhaps a CH2 connected to a CH.

- The CH (in the middle) would be a triplet or multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The terminal CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

Additionally, the methyl group attached to the CH is a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H).

So, that fits the substituent as a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is perhaps a hydrolysis reaction. But wait, if X is already the acid, why is it reacting?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound, like an ester, and the reaction produces the acid. So, X would be the ester, and the product is option C.

But without knowing X's exact structure, it's a bit challenging. But given the options and the data, option C seems to fit the NMR data.

So, the reaction of X (maybe an ester) with red phosphorus and HI produces option C, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving Compound X, which has given IR and NMR data, reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - A strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of an aromatic ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to the CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

3. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides or esters to form carboxylic acids. If Compound X is an ester, this reaction would convert it into the corresponding carboxylic acid.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group indicated by the non-aromatic signals.
   - **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR or NMR data.
   - **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: The NMR data matches this structure:
     - The aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) corresponds to a para-substituted benzene.
     - The non-aromatic signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) correspond to a sec-butyl group.
     - The 10.5 ppm peak corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton.
     - The IR data also supports the presence of a carboxylic acid and an aromatic ring.
   - **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR or NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (Option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter this structure, as it is already a carboxylic acid.
