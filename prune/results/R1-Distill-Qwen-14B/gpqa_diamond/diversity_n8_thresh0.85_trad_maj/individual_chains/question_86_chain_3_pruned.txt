Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) but with different configurations: one is (R) and the other is (S). The question is asking which starting materials (A and B) are correct based on the reagents used.

The reactions are:
- A reacts with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
- B reacts with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different compounds for A and B. All options involve (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) but with different configurations (R or S).

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is a milder one. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, right, BH3 is typically used for ketone reductions, but it's milder than LiAlH4. Wait, noâ€”actually, LiBH4 is a selective reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols but not ketones as readily. Wait, no, no, in some cases, LiBH4 can reduce esters more effectively. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. I think BH3 is used for the reduction of ketones and aldehydes, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent that can also reduce esters. Or wait, no, I think LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, whereas BH3 might not. Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall.

Wait, I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. BH3 is used for the reduction of ketones and aldehydes to secondary and primary alcohols, respectively. LiBH4 can do the same, but it's also used to reduce other groups like esters and amides. Oh wait, no, wait: LiBH4 actually can't reduce esters as effectively as some other agents. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, perhaps it's
