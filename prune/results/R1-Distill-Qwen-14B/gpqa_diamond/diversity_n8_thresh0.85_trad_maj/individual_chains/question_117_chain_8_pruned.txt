Okay, so I've got this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which means they have chiral centers. Right, chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. So I need to check each option to see if they have any such centers.

The question gives four compounds numbered 1 to 4, and the options are combinations of which ones show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the nitro groups are at 6 and 6', and the carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So the structure might have some symmetry. Are there any chiral centers here? The carbons where the substituents are attached—like the 2 and 6 positions—what are their environments? For each substituent, are they attached to a carbon that's connected to four different groups?

Wait, the central bond is single, so the biphenyl can rotate, but the substituents are on opposite sides. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that each ring's substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe they don't create chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a plane of symmetry, making them achiral. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are such that each ring has the same groups in equivalent positions, perhaps it's not chiral. But wait, maybe the molecule as a whole is chiral if the substituents are in a way that doesn't allow superimposing on their mirror image. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is on a benzene ring that's symmetric. I'm not entirely sure yet. I'll mark this as unsure and move on, maybe come back later.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw this structure. It's CH3CO-O-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate... the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, perhaps. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-? Wait, no, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-—so the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait. Let me think again. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. That's CH3CH(OH)COOH. Then the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon connected to OH is the central carbon. Let's see the groups attached: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? Wait, no. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is (CH3) attached to a CH group that has OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

The central carbon (second carbon of propanoate) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the third carbon as the ester)
- And what else? The central carbon is CH, so the groups are:

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one with the CH(OH) group. So the central carbon
