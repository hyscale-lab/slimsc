Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the desired product.

First, let's visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), an ethoxy group at position 1 (which would be the para position relative to tert-butyl, but wait, numbering might be different. Hmm, let me think. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the numbering might affect the substituents' positions. Let me draw it out mentally. Oh, wait, I think the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, benzene with an ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. So, all three substituents are adjacent in a meta fashion? No, wait, 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So, they are in a row. So, it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the numbering right. Benzene has six positions. If the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, that's positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So in the ring, substituents are adjacent: ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, in a row, each next position. So, the substituents are in ortho and meta positions relative to each other.

Now, to make this, I need to consider the directing effects of each substituent. I remember that nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy (which is an OCH2CH3 group) is an activating, ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky group but since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director as well.

Wait, no. Wait, ethoxy is an activating group because it's an ether. The lone pairs on oxygen activate the ring. So, ethoxy directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Similarly, tert-butyl is an activating group (alkyl) which is ortho/para directing.

But nitro is deactivating (meta directing). So when adding substituents, the order in which they are added matters because each substituent directs the next substitution.

Now, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about the order. I think the nitro group is a meta director, so when adding substituents after nitration, you have to take into account where it directs.

But wait, the order of addition is crucial. Let's plan the synthesis steps.

First, perhaps we introduce the strongest activating groups first, as they direct the next substitution. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, sometimes you need to add deactivating groups later because they can't be easily added after activating groups if the positions are blocked.

Wait, in this case, the target has nitro, which is deactivating. So perhaps the nitration step should be done before adding the ethoxy or tert-butyl groups? Or after?

Wait, no, because nitro is a meta director, which would influence where the next substituents go. Alternatively, if we add the ethoxy and tert-butyl first, then the nitro group would be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let me think. Let's try to plan a possible synthetic pathway.

Option 1: Start with benzene, then add ethoxy group. Then add tert-butyl. Then nitro. Or another order.

But wait, the substituents are all in positions 1,2,3. That's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Let me imagine the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl are introduced first, and then nitration happens in a specific position.

Alternatively, maybe nitration is done first. Let me see.

Wait, the target has a nitro group at position 3. So, perhaps when we nitrate, the position where nitro goes is determined by the existing substituents.

But in the target, we have ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the nitro is adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Hmm. Let's think about the possible sequence. Maybe the nitro group is added after one or two substituents.

Wait, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. So, we'll need three substitution steps.

So, perhaps
