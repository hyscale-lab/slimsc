Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Hmm, it's about the distribution of stars and how their number changes with parallax. Let me try to think this through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I remember that uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is constant in all directions. So, space is filled with stars evenly, right?

The main point is to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (which is denoted as plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse power laws, like 1/plx^4 or 1/plx^2, etc. So, I need to figure out which power makes sense.

Wait, I think parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/(distance). That means a star with a larger parallax is closer to us because the parallax is smaller when the star is farther away. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: higher parallax means closer distance. Because parallax is 1/distance in parsecs. So, if plx is 1, distance is 1 parsec. If plx is 0.5, distance is 2 parsecs. So, as plx decreases, the distance increases.

But how does this relate to the number of stars in a given range of plx? Let's think about the volume involved. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a certain volume should be proportional to that volume.

So, imagine we have a thin spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where dr is the thickness. But in terms of parallax, since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So, the volume in terms of plx would involve plx's change.

Wait, let me get this right. Let's say I want to find the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. Stars in this range would lie on a spherical shell with radius r = 1/plx, and thickness dr. But since plx and r are inversely related, dr is related to dplx. Let me see, r = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, but I think for the purposes of volume, I can take the absolute value.

So, the volume of the shell is 4
