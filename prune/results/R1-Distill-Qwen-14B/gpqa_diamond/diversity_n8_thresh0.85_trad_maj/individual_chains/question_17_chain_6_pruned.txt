Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about calcium ions in a solution. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see.

The problem says we have a solution with 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) tells us about the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable because 5x10^10 is a large number.

The formula for the formation constant when a metal ion (like Ca²+) complexes with EDTA (Y⁴-) is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA ions. 

Wait, but in this solution, we have the complex already formed. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the solution is made by dissolving this complex, which will dissociate to some extent. But because Kf is so large, the dissociation should be minimal, right? Like, almost all the Ca-EDTA stays intact. But I can't assume it's 100% dissociation or something. I'll have to calculate it properly.

So let's think about it. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. Let's call the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA will also be x, assuming that each complex releases one Ca and one EDTA. But wait, wait. The stoichiometry is 1:1, right? So the complex dissociates as CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴-.

So the initial concentrations before dissociation are: [CaY²-] = 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = 0, [Y⁴-] = 0. After dissociation, the change would be -x for [CaY²-], and +x for both [Ca²+] and [Y⁴-]. So at equilibrium, the concentrations would be:

[CaY²
