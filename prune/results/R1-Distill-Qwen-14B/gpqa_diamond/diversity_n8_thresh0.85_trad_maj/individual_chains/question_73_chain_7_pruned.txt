Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. I think I need to use Einstein's theory of relativity for this.

Alright, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two velocities. Oh right, you can't just do v = u - v', because that leads to speeds faster than light, which isn't possible. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is something like (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Let me get that straight. So if one object is moving at speed u and the other at speed v, their relative speed isn't u - v but this relativistic formula.

Wait, let me make sure. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the question is about the relative speed, so I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other. Since they're moving in the same direction, I should calculate the relative speed of the slower one from the faster one's frame.

Wait, no, actually, the relative speed formula works regardless of direction as long as you plug in the velocities correctly. Let me think: the formula for the relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So if v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c, then the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating that: numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1-0.3=0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's probably the right relative speed.

Now for the total energy of the system. I think the total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3
