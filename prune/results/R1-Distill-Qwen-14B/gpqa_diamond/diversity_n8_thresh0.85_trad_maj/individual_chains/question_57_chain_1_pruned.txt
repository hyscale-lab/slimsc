Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

The phase shifts are given: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. Right, so I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the phase shifts. Oh wait, the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f(θ), is related to the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts.

Wait, I think the general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) - 1. But since we're only considering the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0, because the beam is along its initial direction. So cosθ is 1.

When θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 give 1 for any l. So the sum becomes sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} - 1, all multiplied by 1/(2ik). But wait, since we're only taking the imaginary part, maybe I can focus on that.

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be (1/(2ik)) times the sum over l of (2l+1) times the imaginary part of e^{2iδ_l} minus the imaginary part of the 1 (which is zero, because 1 is real).

e^{2iδ_l} can be written as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So the imaginary part is sin(2δ_l). So Im f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Now, k is the wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to find k. The energy E is 50 MeV. The mass of
