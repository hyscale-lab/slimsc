Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data includes their masses and some abundance ratios. I remember that [X/Y] denotes the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - (log10(nX/nY)_sun).

Wait, the problem gives [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Oh, right, [Fe/H] is the metallicity, which tells us how much more or less heavy elements are present compared to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, which means log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH) is 7.5-12? Wait no, wait the Sun's data is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Wait no, wait the Sun's data says 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH) =7-12 = -5. So nMg/nH_sun =1e-5.

So for each star, I need to find the ratio of Si atoms, so nSi1 / nSi2.

Wait, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2. So (nSi)_1 / (nSi)_2.

Hmm. So how do I find [Si/H] for each star? Because from that, I can find the ratio.

Wait, let me think about each star.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So for Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0, same as Sun. So nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But wait, I'm trying to find [Si/Fe] for each star.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3.

So log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun=0.3.

So log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

Wait, but I need to find nSi1 and nSi2.

Hmm, perhaps I should express [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of other elements.
