Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. Oh, and their masses are the same. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

Wait, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. That's interesting. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. Oh, right, the formula is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something about the orbital distance). Or wait, maybe it's a ratio involving the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability formula. Let me recall. The probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), where R_p is the planet radius, R_s the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Another thought: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times the impact parameter distribution. But the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the planet's orbital distance
