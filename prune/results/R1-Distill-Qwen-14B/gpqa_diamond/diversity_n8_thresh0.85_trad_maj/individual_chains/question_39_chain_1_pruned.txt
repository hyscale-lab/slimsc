Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of "a" in the wave function. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that each particle has a wave function described as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, they found none at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, that probably means the wave function is zero outside this interval, but wait, the given wave function doesn't look like it's zero there. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, the wave function is given in a part of space where the particles can exist. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but in the region between 1 and 3, it's given by that expression.

Wait, but the wave function provided is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Hmm, but for a valid wave function, the total probability should integrate to 1. So I probably need to normalize the wave function.

Wait, the wave function is a function of x, right? So the normalization condition is the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space equals 1. But since the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, I only integrate from 1 to 3.

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is |ψ|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ] because when you square the modulus, you take the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Wait, that makes sense. So I can split the integral into two parts: the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both over x from 1 to 3.

Calculating each part:

First, integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. Let me make a substitution u = 1+x, so du=dx. When x=1, u=2; x=3, u=4.

So the integral becomes a² ∫ du/u from 2 to4. That's a² [ln(u)] from 2 to4 = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

Adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Wait, wait, because when I set the total integral equal to 1:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Hmm, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0
