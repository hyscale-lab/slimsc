Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use Einstein's theory of relativity. Right, so relativistic equations apply here.

So the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Wait, m is probably the rest mass of the astronaut. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c.

The options are given for relative speed (v_rel) and total energy (E). The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each part.

First, the relative speed. How do you find the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds? Oh, right, you can't just subtract their velocities because that would be a Galilean addition, which doesn't work at high speeds. Instead, you need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is: v_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A*v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, wait. Wait, I think I got that right. Let me make sure. If object A is moving at v_A and object B at v_B (both in the same direction), then the relative speed of A as seen from B's frame is (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Oh, because from B's frame, A is moving at v_A - v_B, but with relativistic correction.

So in this problem, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same positive x-direction. So from B's frame, the speed of A would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6*0.5 c
