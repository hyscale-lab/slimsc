Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data after a specific reaction. Hmm, I need to think about what the reaction does and how the NMR spectra can help me figure out the structure.

The reaction conditions are important. Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (which I remember is a type of catalyst, maybe for an epoxidation reaction) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, 403 K is about 130°C, which is quite hot. So, what kind of reaction would that be? Oh, right, I think that's the conditions for the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Epoxidation typically adds an epoxide group across a double bond.

So, Compound X probably has a double bond that, under these conditions, gets converted into an epoxide. So, the product is an epoxide. Now, the NMR data is for the product, so the product has an epoxide group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: The signals are δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, so that's a total of 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 protons. But the formula of the product? The original compound X is C11H12O. The catalyst is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is a tertiary amine, but it's not part of the product. So, the product would have the same number of carbons as X, but with an epoxide added. Wait, the reaction adds an oxygen from the catalyst? Or maybe the catalyst is just a base or acid?

Wait, no. The Prilezhaev epoxidation uses a peracid, but in this case, perhaps with a different oxidizing agent. Wait, actually, I'm a bit rusty. Oh, wait, the reaction conditions mentioned here involve 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I think that's a catalyst for the epoxidation, maybe with a peracid as the oxidizing agent. So, the product would have an epoxide group.

So, the product is an epoxide derived from a styrene or similar structure. Let's look at the NMR.

The 1H NMR shows two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Since they're both around 2.3, maybe they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe they are attached to carbons that are symmetrical.

Then, the aromatic region: from 6.75 to 7.71 ppm. The splitting suggests doublets. Let me think about coupling in aromatic rings. For example, a para-substituted benzene would have two doublets each integrating to two H. Wait, the 6.75 is a doublet (1H), 7.08 is a doublet of two H, 7.68 is a doublet (1H), and 7.71 is a doublet of two H. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me count the H: 1 + 2 +1 +2 = 6 H. So, a benzene ring with substituents. Maybe a substituent in the para position?

Wait, perhaps there's a substituent that causes the aromatic protons to split into different patterns. Let me think about a para-substituted styrene. If the substituent is an epoxide group, that could cause the aromatic protons to split into specific patterns. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in the ortho position.

Wait, in the NMR, the aromatic region shows four doublets. Let me think about the coupling. For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps. Or maybe a substituent that's causing two adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Wait, another approach: looking at the 13C NMR data. The 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 ppm, which is a carbonyl. Wait, but epoxides are ethers, their carbons are around 50-70 ppm. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm wrong. Or perhaps that's a carbonyl from another functional group. Hmm, wait, the product has an epoxide, but that would be two adjacent CH2O groups?

Wait, the 13C NMR data:

21.3 (1C, s) – probably a methyl group attached to something.

28.4 (1C, s) – another CH2 or CH group.

126.9 (2C, s) – maybe carbons in a conjugated system.

127.1 (1C, s) – another aromatic or conjugated carbon.

129.1 (2C, s) – more aromatic carbons.

130.3 (1C, s) – perhaps a quaternary carbon.

141.5 (1C, s) – maybe a carbon attached to an oxygen, like an epoxide.

144.1 (1C, s) – another quaternary or oxygen-bearing carbon.

197.7 (1C, s) – this is a high shift. Wait, that's more like a carbonyl group. But the product is an epoxide, which shouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Did I get the reaction right?

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. The product, after epoxidation, would have more oxygen. Let me calculate. The original compound has 11 C, 12 H, 1 O. If the reaction adds an epoxide (which adds an O), then the product would have 11 C, 12 H - 2 H + 2 O (since epoxide is O added). Wait, no. Epoxidation adds an O. So, the product would have 11 C, 12 - 2 H (since the double bond becomes an epoxide, which is an additional O but same number of H?), or maybe same H?

Wait, no. The reaction is between the double bond and the oxidizing agent. Let me think: in epoxidation, the double bond (C=C) becomes an epoxide (O connecting the two carbons). So, the number of H remains the same? Because each C in the double bond had two H each (if it's a trans or cis double bond), but upon epoxidation, each C has only one H. Wait, no. For example, ethene (H2C=CH2) has four H. Ethylene oxide (epoxide) is (CH2)2O, which has two CH2 groups, each with two H. So, same number of H. So, if the starting material is C11H12O, the product would have C11H12O2? Because the epoxide adds an O.

Wait, but the product's formula isn't given, but the NMR data must match the structure.

Looking back at the 13C NMR: the 197.7 ppm is a big clue. That's a very high shift, which is more typical of a ketone or maybe an ester carbonyl. Wait, but why would that be present in the product? If the starting material had a carbonyl, but after epoxidation, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps that's a carbonyl from a different group.

Wait, let's think about the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the structure would be an epoxide (oxirane) with a substituent that is a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a vinylbenzene, so 4-methylstyryl is a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group attached.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So, the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the benzene, and the oxirane is at position 2. Wait, that might result in a different NMR.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the oxirane is at position 2, and there's a methyl group at position 3, and a styryl group elsewhere.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So, the styryl group is attached to the epoxide.

Wait, the product is an epoxide. So, all the options are epoxides with different substituents.

So, let's think about the NMR.

The 1H NMR has two singlets of 3H each. Maybe two methyl groups. So, where would that come from in the structures?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the substituent is a 4-methylstyryl group. That would be a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, styryl is a benzene with a vinyl substituent, so 4-methylstyryl is benzene with a methyl in para and a vinyl group (CH2=CH– attached?) So, in that structure, the vinyl group would have CH2–, but perhaps there's a double bond.

Wait, the product's NMR shows aromatic protons. Let me think about the coupling in the aromatic region.

The 1H NMR:

6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me imagine the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has substituents that cause the protons to split into these doublets.

In a para-substituted styrene, the aromatic protons would be in certain patterns. Wait, if the substituent is in the para position, perhaps the protons adjacent to the substituent would be as a doublet.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide where one of the oxygen-connected carbons is connected to a styryl group. So, think of a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group attached to an epoxide.

But let's think about the NMR. The aromatic signals: if the substituent is a vinyl group, the coupling between the protons on the benzene and the vinyl protons might cause splitting. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the 13C NMR, the 197.7 ppm is a big clue. That's a very high carbon shift, which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. But epoxide doesn't have a carbonyl. So, maybe the product isn't an epoxide but something else. Wait, but the reaction is supposed to be an epoxidation. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the 197.7 is not a carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe it's an oxygen-bearing carbon. Wait, no, 197 is higher than typical for an epoxide. Wait, for example, ketone carbons are around 200-220, but 197 is a bit lower. Or maybe it's an ester or amide, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the starting material had a carbonyl group that was unaffected by the reaction.

Wait, the initial compound X is C11H12O. Epoxidation would add an oxygen, making O2. So, the product would be C11H12O2.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the 197.7 ppm could be a carbonyl, which would imply that the starting material had a ketone or ester, but that's not matching with the reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe that peak isn't a carbonyl but something else. Wait, could it be a carbonyl from an ester? Or perhaps an aldehyde? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 197.7 is a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like an epoxide. Wait, but I thought epoxide carbons are around 50-70 ppm.

Wait, maybe the 197.7 is the oxygen-bearing carbon in the epoxide. But that doesn't make sense because epoxide carbons are usually around 60-70. So, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is a quaternary carbon. Or maybe it's a carbonyl from another group. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the 1H NMR again. Two singlets at δ2.28 and 2.31, each 3H. That suggests two methyl groups that are not split by neighboring protons. So, perhaps they are attached to carbons that don't have adjacent H. Like, maybe attached to an oxygen or a quaternary carbon.

In the product, which is an epoxide, the structure would have two adjacent carbons connected by an oxygen. So, perhaps each of these carbons has a methyl group. Wait, that could be the case in some of the options.

Looking at option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So, the oxirane is at position 2, and the substituent is a propenyl group attached to a phenyl. Let me draw that structure. The oxirane would have two substituents: one is the phenylpropenyl group, and perhaps a methyl.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-C (oxirane ring)
 with substituents attached.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituent like (Ph-CH2-C(CH2O)2?), I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let me think about the structure of each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the oxirane (epoxide) is at position 2, and the substituent is a styryl group (vinylbenzene) with a methyl in the para position. So, the styryl would be attached to the epoxide ring. That would give a structure where the epoxide is connected to a benzene ring via a vinyl group, and the benzene has a methyl in the para position.

In this case, the NMR would show aromatic protons, maybe with a specific coupling pattern. The two methyl groups (from the epoxide and the para methyl) would show up as singlets.

Wait, if the substituent is a 4-methylstyryl group, the benzene ring would have a methyl and a vinyl group. The vinyl group is connected to the epoxide. So, the benzene ring's substituents would be in para positions, leading to certain aromatic proton signals.

Alternatively, the structure could have the epoxide connected to the styryl group, which is connected to the benzene.

In terms of the 1H NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets: one for 1H (like a proton adjacent to substituent), and another for 2H (maybe the two protons ortho to substituents), and another set
