Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told to assume LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), so I think that means the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

Alright, so I remember that the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system to temperature. The formula, I think, is something like the ratio of populations being equal to an exponential factor involving the energy difference and temperature.

So the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, but in this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote it as ΔE. So ΔE = E2 - E1. 

The problem states that in star_1, the excited state is twice as populated as in star_2. Wait, actually, wait a second. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So that would mean that for star_1, the population of the excited level (n1) is twice that of star_2's (n2). Or wait, maybe I should think of it as for each star, we compare their own populations. No, wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited compared to star_2. Wait, so maybe the ratio is (n1/n2)_star1/(n1/n2)_star2 = 2? Or perhaps I should model each star separately.

Wait, let's get this straight. For each star, we have a Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, n1_1 / n2_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, n1_2 / n2_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But wait, assuming that the ground state is the same for both, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says the energy difference is the same for both stars, so E2 - E1 is ΔE for both. 

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So let me clarify: each star's photosphere has its own populations. So for star_1, let's say the number of atoms in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. The problem says n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state that's different between the two stars. Oh wait, no. The question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the other state is 2 times higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it this way: for both stars, the ratio of the excited state (n) to the ground state (N) is given by Boltzmann factors. So for star_1, n1/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, n2/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). But what's given is that n1/N1 is twice as much as n2/N2? Or wait, no. The question says that the excited atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, maybe the ratio isn't the same. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's that the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1/N1) = 2*(n2/N2). But wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2's excited state. But without knowing the ground state populations, that might complicate things. Hmm, maybe I should think of the ratio of the excited states relative to the same ground state. But wait, each star's ground state is different? No, the energy levels are the same for iron atoms regardless of the star, so the structure is the same. So E2 and E1 are the same for both stars.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J for both stars.

So for star_1, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is (n1/N1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's (n2/N2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n1/N1) is twice as much as (n2/N2). So (n1/N1) = 2*(n2/N2).

So substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Let me rearrange that:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, let's compute
