Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is involved, right? I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the redistribution of alkene fragments. So, the catalyst breaks and reforms double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, is the molecule chiral? Let me think. 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)H2-CH2? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So, 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon. That would make it CH2=CH-C(CH3)2? Wait no, wait. Let's count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is five carbons, double bond between 1-2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2
