Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right, red phosphorus and HI usually mean some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something else.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad range. That usually indicates either an O-H stretch (like in an acid or alcohol) or maybe an N-H stretch. But since there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's an acid because both O-H and C=O are present. Wait, but if it's an acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 3000-2500. Let me think... another possibility is an ester, but then the IR wouldn't have a broad peak in that range unless it's an acid.

Looking at the other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's probably a benzene ring in the compound. So putting that together, maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative. Because benzoic acid would have the carboxylic acid group (so O-H and C=O) and the aromatic ring.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's typical of a carboxylic acid proton. So that's another clue pointing towards a benzoic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest two sets of equivalent protons, probably in the para positions. So if the substituents are at para positions, that fits with a benzene ring where two substituents are opposite each other.

The next signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's try to visualize these. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to something that has two neighboring protons. Like a CH2CH2CH3 group, maybe. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) could be a methyl attached to something else. Wait, maybe it's a CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a branching point.

Wait, putting this together. Let's think about the possible structure of Compound X. If the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carboxylic acid group (because of the IR and NMR data), then the other substituent is probably an alkyl group attached to the benzene. The substituents are in para positions because of the NMR signals.

So, the benzene ring has a -COOH group and an alkyl group attached in para positions. The alkyl group's structure is indicated by the NMR signals. Let's see:

The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) could be a CH(CH2CH3) group, but wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to something else. Let me think about the other signals. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) and 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be part of a CH2CH2 group or a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a sec-butyl group. Because the sec-butyl group has a structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Let me think about the NMR of a sec-butyl group. The end CH3 would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2), so the 0.9 ppm triplet. Then the CH2 next to it would be a quartet, but in the data, I don't see a quartet. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. The NMR for isobutyl groups: the terminal CH2 would be a triplet (at around 1.2 ppm perhaps), but here the triplet is at 0.9. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a 4-ethyl group or some other branching.

Wait, let's think about each part:

- The triplet at 0.9 (3H) is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the structure is a propyl group attached to something else. But then, the 1.4 ppm (3H) doublet might be a CH3 attached to a CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal group, like a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, another approach: looking at the molecular formula. Let's try to count the hydrogens from the NMR. But without the integration percentages, it's a bit tricky, but in the data, the integrals are given as 1H, 2H, etc.

But perhaps the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think. If the benzene ring is para-substituted with a COOH and a sec-butyl group.

So the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, butyl can be straight or branched. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), is that right? Or is it -(CH2)2CH2CH3? No, no. Let me think again: butyl has four carbons. The straight chain is n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3. The iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2. The sec-butyl would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, the substituent is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait that would be a three-carbon chain. Wait, no. Wait, butyl is four carbons. So the straight chain is four carbons, with the substituent on the second carbon. So it would be CH2CH2CH2CH3 where the substituent is on the second carbon. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, maybe it's more like -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Let me correct: the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that would be a quaternary carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, butyl groups:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2- (four carbons in a row)
iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but wait, iso-butyl is CH(CH3)2CH2-? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, another approach: in the NMR, the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe the structure has a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to a CH2 that's next to another group.

Wait, let's consider the possibility of a propyl group. So a propyl group would have a triplet at the end (CH2CH2CH3), which would match the 0.9 ppm triplet. Then the next CH2 would be a quartet, but in the given data, I don't see a quartet. Alternatively, maybe the group is a pentyl or some other.

Alternatively, looking at the NMR signals:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): probably a CH2CH2CH3 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): perhaps a CH3 attached to a CH that is part of a larger group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps two protons on a CH2 that's adjacent to branching.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH that's connected to other groups, maybe a CH next to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps it's a structure where the benzene ring has a COOH group and a substituent that's
