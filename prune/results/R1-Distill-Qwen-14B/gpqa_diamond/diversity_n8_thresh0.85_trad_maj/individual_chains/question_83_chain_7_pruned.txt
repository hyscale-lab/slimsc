Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get tricky. Let me read through the question carefully and start breaking it down.

Alright, the problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I need to find the pH for two different points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, that's 0.04 liters in SI units.

So the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution: Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after dilution, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is moles/volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L is indeed 0.001 moles. And when you add 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present. So, moles of acetic acid initially after dilution is 0.001 moles (since it's 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol? Wait, 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001. Yes.)

So, moles of NaOH required at equivalence is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. Since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, 25% titration refers to the percentage of the analyte's moles that have been neutralized. Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. How much NaOH is needed for that? Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, the volume of NaOH would be 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So that's the same as the previous approach. So yes, 2.5 cm³ is the point.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Now, the solution at this point will have some amount of acetate ions and some unreacted acetic acid. Let me calculate the concentrations.

First, the total volume at 25% is initial volume (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

Moles of acetic acid reacted: 0.00025 mol (since 25% of 0.001), so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) = 0 - (-4.735
