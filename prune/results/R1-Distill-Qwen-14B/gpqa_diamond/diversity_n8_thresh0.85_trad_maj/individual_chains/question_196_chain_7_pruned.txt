Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. But this is the relativistic case, so things are a bit different.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the equations step by step.

First, I should recall the energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Wait, in classical mechanics, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kx², right? So the total energy E is (γ-1)mc² + (1/2)kx². At the maximum amplitude A, the mass is at rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. Then, when it passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy becomes kinetic. So, the maximum kinetic energy is equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, that's correct. But relativistically, maybe I should think about how the energy is conserved.

At x = A: all energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA².

At x = 0: all energy is kinetic, so E = (γ_max - 1)mc². So setting them equal:

(γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Hmm, solving for γ_max. Let's rearrange that.

γ_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that makes sense. Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is the rest energy plus the kinetic part. So γ_max is 1 plus (k A²)/(2 m c squared).

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again. The total energy at rest (x=A) is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic when x=0. So kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc² = (1/2)kA². So, solving for γ:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Now, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, β. So β = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + β.

Let me solve for v_max.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/(1 + β).

Square both sides:

1 - (v²/c²) = 1/(1 + β)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + β)^2].

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me compute it.

v²/c² = [ (1 + β)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + β)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2β + β² - 1) = 2β + β².

So,

v²/c² = (2β + β²) / (1 + β)^2.

Factor numerator: β(2 + β) over denominator (1+β)^2.

But β is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a small term if k A² is much smaller than 2 m c². But in this problem, I don't know if we can assume that.

Wait, but perhaps the way to express v_max is in terms of c and this expression.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the total energy at maximum displacement is E = (1/2)k A². So, at that point, all energy is potential. At maximum speed, x=0, so potential is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So,

(γ -1)mc² = (1/2)k A².

So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but in reality, the total energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case might be different. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)k A², but relativistically, the mass increases with speed, so maybe the potential energy expression is modified? Hmm, I'm
