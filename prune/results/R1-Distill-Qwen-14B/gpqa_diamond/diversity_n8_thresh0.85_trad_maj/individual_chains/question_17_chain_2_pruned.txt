Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. So the question says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex without any issues. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given, and I need to find which one is correct.

Wait, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The formula for the formation constant K is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). Oh wait, but in this case, the solution is of the Ca-EDTA complex, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

I think the key here is to realize that the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−. But since the K is very large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, so it won't dissociate much. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA⁴− will be very low.

Wait, but wait. The formation constant K is given. So the K is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]) = 5e10. So rearranging, [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] = [CaEDTA²−]/K.

But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the dissociation is minimal, which it should be because K is large, so the concentration of the complex doesn't change much. So [CaEDTA²−] is approximately 0.02 M.

So [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴−] because for every mole of CaEDTA²− that dissociates, you get one mole of each ion. So [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴−] = x.

So substituting into the equation: [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] = x^2 = (0.02)/(5e10).

Wait, let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) which is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is 6.32e-7.

Wait, that's 6.32e-7 M, which is around 6.3e-7. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So that would be the concentration of Ca²+.

But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes the formation constant uses different stoichiometry. Wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so each EDTA forms a 1:1 complex with Ca²+. So the formula is correct.

Another way to think: The complex dissociates as CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴−. So the expression is K = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]/[CaEDTA²−]. So [Ca²+] = sqrt( (K * [CaEDTA²−])^{-1} )

Wait, no, K = [product]/[reactants]. So K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. So rearranged, [
