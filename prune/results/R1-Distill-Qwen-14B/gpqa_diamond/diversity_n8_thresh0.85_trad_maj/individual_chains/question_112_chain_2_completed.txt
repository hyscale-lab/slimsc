Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, wait, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-component of the spin operator, S_z. So, the state is a linear combination of these two states. But wait, it's proportional, which probably means it's not normalized yet. I think I'll need to normalize it first before I can find probabilities.

The next part is about another operator whose matrix elements are given by A_ij. The rule is that A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. So, I'm thinking about the matrix form of this operator. Let's see, since the basis is |up> and |down>, the matrix should be 2x2. For i≠j, that would mean the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. The diagonal elements are when i=j, which are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, no. Because in matrix terms, A_12 and A_21 would be hbar/2, and A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix is:

| 0       hbar/2 |
| hbar/2  0      |

But wait, another way to represent that is that the operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So, A = (hbar/2) X. That might help later.

The question asks for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A, and the average value of A. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A, then find the probabilities, and then compute the expectation value.

But wait, let me think again. Because A is a spin operator, similar to the Pauli matrices. The eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of X, because A is proportional to X. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

So the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis. To find the probabilities when measured in the x-basis (eigenstates of A), I need to express |alpha> in terms of the x-basis eigenstates or compute the overlap between |alpha> and those eigenstates.

Alternatively, since the operator is A, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. The eigenvalues of A would be the same as for X multiplied by hbar/2. Since the eigenvalues of X are ±1, the eigenvalues of A are ±(hbar/2).

Wait, but the question says "eigenstates of the operator A", so when measuring A, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the state |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the expectation value of A by using matrix representation and the state vector.

But let's start by normalizing the state |alpha>. So, the state is given as |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So each coefficient's magnitude is |(1+i)| and |(2 -i)|.

Wait, |1 + i| is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, |2 - i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So the normalization factor N is 1 / sqrt( (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 ) ) = 1 / sqrt(2 +5) = 1/sqrt(7).

Wait, because when you square the magnitudes, (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, and (sqrt(5))^2 is 5, so sum is 7, square root is sqrt(7). So |alpha> becomes (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the state vector in the z-basis is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is given by the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

To find the expectation value of A, I can compute <alpha| A |alpha> using the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value by expressing A in terms of Pauli matrices and then using the expectation value formula.

Wait, A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, since X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (hbar/2) X. The expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of X.

The expectation value of X for a spin-1/2 system is given by the Bloch vector in the x-direction. Alternatively, the expectation value can be found as:

< X > = 2 * Re( <alpha| X |alpha> )

Wait, no, more accurately, since X is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±1, and the expectation value is a real number.

So, <X> = [ (0)(0) + (0)(0) + ... ] Wait, perhaps better to compute it directly.

Alternatively, for a spin-1/2 state, the expectation value of X is 2 times the x-component of the Bloch vector. But perhaps it's easier to compute it using the state vector.

The expectation value of X is:

< X > = [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )*(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, no, because X is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix elements are:

X |up> = |down>, X |down> = |up>.

So, to compute <alpha| X |alpha>, I can write it as:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T† * X * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, actually, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose multiplied by X multiplied by the vector.

So,

E(X) = (1/sqrt(7))^2 [ (1 - i) (2 + i) + (2 - i)(1 + i) ) ]

Wait, let me compute each term. The first term is the first component of the conjugate transpose (which is (1-i)/sqrt(7)) multiplied by the second component of the vector (2 - i)/sqrt(7)), and the second term is the second component of the conjugate transpose ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) multiplied by the first component (1 + i)/sqrt(7)).

So,

E(X) = [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 - i)(1 + i) ) ] * (1/7 )

Let me compute (1 - i)(2 - i):

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 - 3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Then, (2 - i)(1 + i):

2*1 + 2*i -i*1 -i*i = 2 +2i -i -i^2
= 2 +i - (-1)
= 2 +i +1 = 3 +i.

So adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (3 +i) = 4 -2i.

Wait, wait, perhaps I did that incorrectly. Let me double-check.

Wait, (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*(2) + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (because i^2 is -1)
= 1 -3i.

Then, (2 -i)(1 +i) = 2*(1) + 2*i -i*(1) -i*i
= 2 + 2i -i -i^2
= 2 + i - (-1) because i^2 = -1
= 2 +i +1 = 3 +i.

So, adding these together: 1-3i +3+i = 4 -2i.

But wait, that's the numerator in E(X). So,

E(X) = (4 - 2i) /7.

Wait, but the expectation value of X must be real, because X is Hermitian. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, the expectation value is [ (1 -i)(2 - i) + (2 -i)(1 + i) ] / 7.

Wait, no, because when you compute (1-i) (2-i) you're taking the first component of the conjugate transpose (which is (1-i)/sqrt(7)) multiplied by the second component of the vector (2 -i)/sqrt(7). Similarly, the other term is the second component of the conjugate transpose ( (2-i)/sqrt(7) ) multiplied by the first component (1 +i)/sqrt(7). So each term is (1-i)(2 -i) and (2 -i)(1 +i), but then sum these, and since the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], the off-diagonal terms contribute. Wait, perhaps I should have taken the conjugate transpose, but let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of X is the sum over i,j of alpha_i^* A_ij alpha_j.

In this case, A is the matrix of X scaled by hbar/2. Wait no, A is the matrix we're considering, which is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So the expectation value is:

< A > = sum_{i,j} alpha_i^* A_ij alpha_j.

Which for a 2x2 matrix is:

alpha_1^* * A_11 alpha_1 + alpha_1^* A_12 alpha_2 + alpha_2^* A_21 alpha_1 + alpha_2^* A_22 alpha_2.

But A_11 and A_22 are zero, so only the cross terms contribute.

So,

< A > = alpha_1^* A_12 alpha_2 + alpha_2^* A_21 alpha_1.

Since A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2.

So,

< A > = (hbar/2) [ alpha_1^* alpha_2 + alpha_2^* alpha_1 ].

Which is (hbar/2) times [ ( (1-i)/sqrt(7) )*( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )*( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ) ].

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 -i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2i -i(1) -i^2 = 2 +2i -i +1 = 3 +i.

So,

Sum = (1 -3i) + (3 +i) = 4 -2i.

Now, multiply by (hbar/2) * (1/7):

Because each alpha is divided by sqrt(7), so when you multiply them, it's (1/7). So,

< A > = (hbar/2) * (4 - 2i) /7.

Wait, but that can't be right because the expectation value should be real. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (1-i)(2 - i) again:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Wait, correct.

Then, (2 -i)(1 + i) = 2*(1) + 2*(i) -i*(1) -i*(i)
= 2 +2i -i -i^2
= 2 +i - (-1)
= 3 +i.

So the sum is (1-3i) + (3 +i) = 4 -2i.

Wait, but this sum is 4 -2i, but when multiplied by (hbar/2) and (1/7), it's (hbar/2)*(4-2i)/7. But that's a complex number, which can't be the expectation value because A is Hermitian, so its expectation must be real.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I should take the real part of this sum because the expectation is real.

Wait, because < A > must be real, so perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value is the sum of the real parts. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value without the hbar/2 factor first, then apply it.

Wait, A is (hbar/2) X, so the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of X.

The expectation value of X is calculated as:

E(X) = [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 -i)(1 +i) ] / 7.

Wait, but I've already computed this sum as 4 -2i. So E(X) would be (4 -2i)/7, which is complex. That can't be right because X is Hermitian, so E(X) must be real. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I have the signs wrong. Let me recheck the terms.

Wait, when calculating E(X), it's (alpha_1^* alpha_2 + alpha_2^* alpha_1 ) / 7.

Because X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so <X> = (alpha_1^* alpha_2 + alpha_2^* alpha_1).

So,

alpha_1 = (1 + i)/sqrt(7),

alpha_2 = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So,

alpha_1^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7),

alpha_2^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So,

alpha_1^* alpha_2 = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7,

alpha_2^* alpha_1 = (2 +i)(1 +i) /7.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The second term is alpha_2^* alpha_1, not alpha_2^* alpha_1. So,

alpha_2^* alpha_1 = (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 + i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So now, adding the two terms:

alpha_1^* alpha_2 = (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

alpha_2^* alpha_1 = (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So, sum = (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So E(X) = 2/7.

Because the sum is 2, and we're dividing by 7.

So,

< A > = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7).

Because 2/7 multiplied by hbar/2 gives hbar/7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Wait, that makes sense. So for the expectation value, the answer is hbar/7. Looking at the options, option A has hbar/7, option C has hbar/sqrt(7), and others have different fractions. So the average value is hbar/7.

Now, the other part is the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A. Since A is proportional to X, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

The probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> states.

But how do I find those amplitudes?

Another approach: Express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x> states.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Compute a and b.

Given |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, |alpha> = c |+x> + d |−x>.

Find c and d.

We can write:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down> = c ( (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) + d ( (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) ) )

Let me collect terms for |up> and |down>:

|up> terms:

[ c (1/sqrt(2)) ) + d (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

|down> terms:

[ c (1/sqrt(2)) ) - d (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] = (2−i)/sqrt(7)

So, the two equations are:

( c + d ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)  →  c + d = (1 + i) sqrt(2/7)

( c - d ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7) → c - d = (2 -i) sqrt(2/7)

Now, adding and subtracting these equations.

Add the two equations:

2c = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2/7 )

= (3) sqrt(2/7 )

So, c = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

2d = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2/7 )

= [ -1 + 2i ] sqrt(2/7 )

So, d = [ (-1 + 2i ) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

Wait, but let me compute the magnitudes of c and d to find the probabilities.

The probability of measuring |+x> is |c|^2, and the probability of measuring |-x> is |d|^2.

Compute |c|^2:

c = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

So, |c|² = (9/4) * (2/7) ) = (18)/(28) )= 9/14 ≈0.6429.

Hmm, but that's approximately 0.64, which is option A's first probability.

Wait, but let me compute |d|².

d = [ (-1 + 2i ) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

The magnitude squared of d is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /4 ] * (2/7 )

= (1 +4)/4 * (2/7 )

= (5/4) * (2/7) )= 10/(28) )= 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which adds up to 14/14 =1.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Yes, that fits.

But wait, let me ensure that I'm correctly finding the probabilities. Because |c|² is | [3/2 sqrt(2/7) ] |², which is (9/4) * (2/7) )= 18/28 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, |d|² is | [ (-1 + 2i )/(2) * sqrt(2/7) ] |².

The numerator's magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). So,

|d|² = ( sqrt(5) / 2 )^2 * (2/7) )

= (5/4) * (2/7) )= 10/(28) =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.642857 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches approximately.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.3571), and the average value is hbar/7.

So the correct option would be option A, which lists 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i| = \sqrt{2}, \quad |2-i| = \sqrt{5}.
\]

The normalization factor is:

\[
N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Expectation Value of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the state \( |\alpha\rangle = \left[\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}\right]^T \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right).
\]

First, compute the product:

\[
(1+i)(2-i) = 2 - i + 2i - i^2 = 2 + i + 1 = 3 + i.
\]

Taking the real part:

\[
\text{Re} \left( \frac{3+i}{7} \right) = \frac{3}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \frac{6}{7}.
\]

The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates of \( A \)
The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). The probabilities of measuring these eigenstates are given by the square of the overlaps:

\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2, \quad P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2.
\]

Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c |+x\rangle + d |-x\rangle.
\]

Substituting \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we solve for \( c \) and \( d \). After computation, the probabilities are:

\[
P(+x) = |c|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |d|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the expectation value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
