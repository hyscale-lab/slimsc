Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons and 4 neutrons in its most common isotope, right? But if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

The question is about relativistic energy. So I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 - v squared over c squared).

So the speed v is 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma first. Plugging v into the equation: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216). That would make the denominator sqrt(0.0784), which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately. 1 - (0.96)^2 is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus can be determined using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol, but wait, that's the molar mass. To get the mass of one nucleus, I should divide by Avogadro's number. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mass based on the constituent protons and neutrons. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the mass defect (binding energy), but I'm not sure if I should calculate it that way or just use the known mass.

Alternatively, the exact mass of Li-6 is known. Let me recall: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 atomic mass units (u). One atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So mass m = 6.0141 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u.

Calculating that: 6.0141 * 1.6605e-27 â‰ˆ let's see, 6 * 1.66 is about 9.96, but 6.0141 is a bit more. Let me compute:

6.0141 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

Well, 6 * 1.6605 is 9.963; 0.0141 * 1
