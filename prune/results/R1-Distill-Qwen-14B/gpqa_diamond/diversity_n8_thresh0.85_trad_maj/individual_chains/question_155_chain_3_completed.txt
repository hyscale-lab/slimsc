Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for the given state. Let's see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩². Wait, no, wait, the formula is actually the square root of ⟨P²⟩ minus ⟨P⟩ squared. So, for P_z, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ minus ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ squared, and then take the square root.

The state vector ψ is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think are the standard basis vectors here. So, I can represent ψ in terms of these basis vectors.

Wait, the matrix form of P_z is given as [[ℏ, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -ℏ]]. So P_z is diagonal, which makes things easier because its eigenvalues are easy to see.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. Oh, but the problem is asking about the uncertainty in P_z, so that's okay—I don't need to worry about P_x unless I'm mixing things up. I just need to calculate the expectation values for P_z and P_z squared in this state.

Let me write down the state vector as a column:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
        [ 1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

So, it's a 3-component vector. Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be ψ† P_z² ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just square each diagonal element.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. The expectation value is the sum of the products of each component of ψ with the corresponding eigenvalue of P_z multiplied by the conjugate of the component.

Wait, but since all the components are real here, I don't have to worry about conjugates. So:

Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding P_z's eigenvalue.

The eigenvalues of P_z are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ for the diagonal elements.

So, ψ has components:

ψ₁ = -1/2 → corresponds to eigenvalue ℏ
ψ₂ = 1/√2 → corresponds to eigenvalue 0
ψ₃ = -1/2 → corresponds to eigenvalue -ℏ

So ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ₁ * ℏ + ψ₂ * 0 + ψ₃ * (-ℏ) 

Plugging in the values: (-1/2)(ℏ) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ℏ) 

Calculating that: (-ℏ/2) + 0 + (ℏ/2) = (-ℏ/2 + ℏ/2) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩?

Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will have the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the diagonal becomes ℏ², 0, and ℏ².

So, P_z squared matrix is [[ℏ², 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ℏ²]]

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ. Let's compute each term:

ψ₁² * ℏ² → (-1/2)^2 * ℏ² = (1/4)ℏ²
ψ₂² * 0 → (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0
ψ₃² * ℏ² → (-1/2)^2 * ℏ^2 = (1/4)ℏ²

Wait, no. Wait, ψ is a column vector, so when we compute ψ† P_z² ψ, it's the same as summing (ψ_i^* ) * (P_z²_ii) * ψ_i.

So each term is (ψ_i)^2 * (P_z squared's diagonal element i).

So:

Term 1: ( (-1/2) )^2 * ℏ² = (1/4) ℏ²
Term 2: (1/√2 )^2 * 0 = 0
Term 3: ( (-1/2) )^2 * ℏ² = (1/4) ℏ²

Adding them up: (1/4 + 1/4) ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ². So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ℏ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² )

Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the delta P_z is sqrt( (1/2 ℏ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ℏ = (ℏ) / sqrt(2).

But wait, looking at the options, option B is ℏ / sqrt(2), and option C is ℏ/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, when I computed ⟨P_z⟩, I had:

ψ_1 * ℏ + ψ_3 * (-ℏ) → (-1/2) ℏ + (1/2) ℏ → indeed zero.

Then, for ⟨P_z²⟩, each component is (ψ_i)^2 multiplied by (ℏ^2 for i=1, 0 for i=2, ℏ^2 for i=3).

So, (1/4) ℏ^2 + (1/4) ℏ^2 = (1/2) ℏ^2.

So the variance is 1/2 ℏ^2, so the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) = (ℏ) / sqrt(2).

So, the uncertainty is ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is given as a column vector. The first component is -1/2, second is 1/√2, third is -1/2.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares.

Compute |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|² + |ψ₃|²: (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Hmm. So, the calculations look correct. So the uncertainty is ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the given system, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the diagonal elements. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi_1 \cdot \hbar + \psi_2 \cdot 0 + \psi_3 \cdot (-\hbar)
\]

Substituting the components of $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot (-\hbar)
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix form of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi_1^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \psi_2^2 \cdot 0 + \psi_3^2 \cdot \hbar^2
\]

Substituting the components of $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
