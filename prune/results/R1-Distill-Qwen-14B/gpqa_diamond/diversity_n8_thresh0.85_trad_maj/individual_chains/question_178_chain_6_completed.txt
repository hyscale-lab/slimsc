Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are related to the generators of Lorentz transformations or something like that, but maybe that's not directly needed here. The main task is to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I think the way to approach this is by dimensional analysis. Each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless. Oh right, in natural units (where c=ħ=1), the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because the action is ∫ d^4x L, which is dimensionless (since each d^4x contributes dimension 4). So each term in the Lagrangian needs to have dimension 4.

So I need to compute the mass dimension of each component in L_int and figure out what dimension κ must have.

Breaking down the term: κ is a coupling constant, ψ is a spinor field, σ is a product of gamma matrices, and F is the field strength tensor.

Let me recall the dimensions of the fields. In 4-dimensional spacetime, the spinor field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because, for a Dirac field, the term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ has dimension 4 (since ∂_μ has dimension 1), so ψ must be 3/2. The same for ψ̄, it's also 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, so their indices don't contribute mass dimensions. So σ_{μν} must be dimensionless as well. Because it's a commutator of two γ matrices.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor, which for electromagnetism is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^mu. Each derivative brings a mass dimension of 1, and A is a gauge field with dimension 1 (since in Maxwell theory, the term ∂_μ A_ν is in the Lagrangian, which needs to have dimension 4). Because each A has dimension 1, so F has each term ∂A which is 1 + 1 = 2. So F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions:

ψ̄ (3/2) × σ (0) × ψ (3/2) × F (2) → sum is (3/2 + 3/2) + 0 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the whole term is κ multiplied by this term. So the dimension of κ × 5 must be 4. So:

[dimension of κ] +5 =4 → dimension of κ is 4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that rules out options where it's 1. So looking at the options, options A and C have [κ]=-1. So between A and C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions. Because, from what I remember, in a renormalizable theory, the interactions are of the form ϕ^k, and the dimension of the coupling is [g] = 4 - d*(field dimension). But if the coupling has negative dimension, that would imply that the interaction term is relevant (in the RG sense), but more importantly, in terms of renormalizability, you can generate an infinite number of terms in the perturbation series, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. The coupling constant's dimension is [κ] = -1, which is negative. So that's a problem because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable. Because the interaction term would have terms that are higher and higher in dimension, requiring you to include an infinite number of terms, which you can't do with a finite number of counterterms.

So since [κ]=-1 <0, the theory isn't renormalizable. So the options are A and C. A says renormalizable, C says not.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Because I thought that for a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Because if a coupling has [g] negative, then when you write the interaction term, you get terms with higher powers of fields, which can't be counterterm'd with finite terms. So, for example, in the case of Fermi's theory of the four-fermion interaction, the coupling has negative mass dimension, which is why it's non-renormalizable.

So in this problem, since [κ]=-1, the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option would have [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. That's option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the dimensions again.

Each ψ is dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ is 3. Then σ_{μν} is dimensionless. F^{mu nu} is dimension 2. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 =5. So the whole term without κ is 5. So κ must have dimension -1 to make the Lagrangian term's dimension 4.

So, yes, [κ]=-1.

Since the coupling has negative dimension, the interaction term is of higher dimension, meaning it's not renormalizable. So the answer is option C: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\), and \(F^{\mu\nu}\) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields and operators
- The spinor field \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\), as does \(\bar{\psi}\).
- The commutator \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, \([\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \([F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2\), as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field \(A_\mu\), which has dimension 1.

### Step 2: Dimension of the interaction term
The term \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has the following mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 (to ensure the action is dimensionless), the coupling constant \(\kappa\) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \([\kappa]_M = -1\), which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension, requiring an infinite number of counterterms for renormalization. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct option is:
