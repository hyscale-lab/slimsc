Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. So, I need to look at each compound and see if they have any such centers.

The question has four moieties, and I need to pick which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each a combination of the numbers.

Let's take them one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, but the substituents are symmetrical. So, if the substituents are on both rings in a mirror image, maybe it's symmetric. Wait, but the biphenyl arrangement—could there be a plane of symmetry? If the molecule is symmetrical, it might not have a chiral center. Let me think. The substituents on each phenyl ring are 2 and 6 positions, which are symmetrical. So, the molecule might not be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the connecting point (the biphenyl) allows for some kind of stereoisomerism. Wait, biphenyl can have E and Z isomerism because of the way the rings are arranged around the single bond. But optical isomerism is about chirality, which requires a chiral center. So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Each of the carbons attached to the ester groups—so the O-CO-OCH3 groups. Let's see: the ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The central carbon in the ester is the one attached to oxygen; wait, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is dimethyl, so each ester is OMe. So, each ester is attached to a phenyl ring. The central carbon where the ester is attached—so the carbon in the ring, which is at position 2. Is that attached to four different groups? Let me think. For a carbon on a benzene ring, like position 2, it's connected to the ring, an ester group (O-CO-OCH3), and two other substituents perhaps. Wait, in the biphenyl, each phenyl is connected to the other at the 1 and 1' positions. So each phenyl has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each phenyl ring is attached to the biphenyl, and at 2 and 6, they have nitro groups and ester groups? Wait, wait, the substituents are 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each phenyl has a carboxylate ester at 2 and a nitro at 6. So, the carbon at position 2 on each phenyl is connected to:

- The benzene ring (so two adjacent carbons are part of the ring, each with substituents)
- The ester group (O-CO-OCH3)
- The nitro group at position 6? Wait, no, wait: position 2 and 6 on the same ring. So, the substituents on each phenyl ring are at 2,6-dinitro and 2,6-dicarboxylate. Wait, no. Wait, the question says it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each phenyl is 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate. So, the carbons at position 2 on each phenyl would have substituents: the ester (O-CO-OCH3), a nitro group (at position 6?), but wait, each ring's position 2 is connected to the ester, and the position 6 is connected to the nitro. But the carbon at position 2 on the benzene is bonded to three other carbons in the ring and the ester group. Wait, actually, in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons (part of the ring) and two other substituents. Wait, no, each benzene carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons (ring), and one substituent (like the ester or nitro). So, wait, the carbon in position 2 on each phenyl has substituents: the ester group (O-CO-OCH3), the two adjacent ring carbons, and the ring itself. Wait, that's three substituents. Wait, no, each carbon in benzene is bonded to three ring carbons? No, each carbon in benzene is bonded to two ring carbons and one substituent. Oh wait, no. Benzene is a six-membered ring with each carbon bonded to two adjacent carbons. So, each C in benzene has three substituents: the two adjacent C's, and the substituent (like ester or nitro). But wait, the substituent is in a specific position. So, the carbon at position 2 would have the ester group attached, and the two adjacent carbons would be part of the ring. So, that carbon is bonded to the ring (so two adjacent carbons), the ester, and perhaps the other substituents? Wait, no, wait. Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, the substituent at 2 is the ester group. So, the carbon at 2 has the ester group, and it's connected to two ring carbons (positions 1 and 3). So, the groups attached to the carbon at 2 are: the ester group, two ring carbons (each part of the benzene ring), and the rest is the ring itself. But wait, in terms of substituents, that carbon is connected to the ester, two ring carbons, and the other ring (the biphenyl). Wait, no, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1' of each ring. So, the carbon at position 2 on each ring is not connected to the biphenyl. So, the substituents on that carbon are: two ring carbons (position 1 and 3), the ester group, and probably the hydrogen. Wait, but benzene is sp² hybridized, so the substituents are attached to the carbon, but the geometry is flat. So, does the carbon at position 2 have four different groups? Let's see: attached to the ester, two adjacent carbons (which are each connected to other groups—maybe one with a nitro and another with an H
