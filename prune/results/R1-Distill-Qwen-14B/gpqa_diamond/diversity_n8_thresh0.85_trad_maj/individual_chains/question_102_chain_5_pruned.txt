Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques and genetics. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Let me recall what bicistronic meansâ€”it's a vector that can express two different proteins from a single mRNA transcript. Each gene is under its own promoter, I think. But wait, in this case, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. Oh right, IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein from the same mRNA. So the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but independently.

The vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then there's a stop cassette with loxP. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, and it's behind a stop cassette with lox2272. So in the vector, the ligand is first, then stop, then the IRES, then the receptor, then stop. So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 sites are recognized, and the stop cassettes are removed. That would allow the ligand and receptor to be expressed, each with their respective fluorescent tags.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic with two cassettes. The setup is: ligand (CBA promoter) followed by a stop in loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor, then a stop in lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. The mCherry is fused to the ligand, and eGFP is after the receptor. So the ligand will have a tag, and the receptor will have another.

So when they use this vector, they're transfecting primary astrocyte cultures. They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested on Western blot. But the mouse model is where the construct is inserted, and they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. The offspring were visualized with a confocal, and the eGFP isn't showing up. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the setup is about expression in the same cells, so if they are expressed, they should be in the same cells. But wait, if the ligand is secreted, maybe? But the question doesn't specify that. I'm not sure, but this might not explain why eGFP isn't showing up.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. The receptor is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in Golgi, it won't be on the cell surface. So in the Western blot, perhaps the protein would still be detected, but in the live imaging, you wouldn't see the GFP. But the Western blot uses total proteins. So if it's stuck in Golgi, it's
