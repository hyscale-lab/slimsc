Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system. 

First, I think that since the state is proportional, we need to normalize it. So I'll calculate the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Calculating that inner product: (1-i) (1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) for the coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

So the first term is (1+i), its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So |1+i|^2 is 2. The second term is (2-i), so |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because the state is proportional, so |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the question asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin up and down, which are two states. So, the matrix for operator A is:

[0   ħ/2]
[ħ/2 0 ]

Because A_12 and A_21 are ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero. Hmm, but wait, that's a bit confusing. In the standard basis, the Pauli matrices have 0s on the diagonal except for sigma_z, but this operator is different. Let me think: the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable. 

I need to find the eigenstates of this operator. Because when you measure the operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in the state |alpha>.

So, first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Let's find its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) = 0. So λ^2 = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Let's start with λ = ħ/2.

(A - (ħ/2) I) = [ [-ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ]

The equations are: (-ħ/2) a + (ħ/2) b = 0 → -a + b =0 → b =a. So the eigenvector is proportional to [1,1]^T. To make it into a unit vector, it's (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)). So the eigenstate is |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix is:

[ [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]]

Wait, no. For λ = -ħ/2, the matrix would be (A - (-ħ/2) I) = [[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ] ]

So the equations are (ħ/2) a + ( ħ/2 ) b =0 → a + b =0 → b = -a. So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1]^T, which normalized is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). So the eigenstate is |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+> and |->, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenstates. We need to find the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Once we have c_+ and c_-, the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2. Also, the average value of the operator is <A> = c_+ λ_+ + c_- λ_-.

But let me compute c_+ and c_-.

First, let's express |alpha> in the standard basis. We already have it as:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

In terms of |up> and |down>, which are the standard basis vectors, we can write this in vector form as:

(alpha_up, alpha_down) = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

We can write |alpha> as a vector.

The eigenstates |+> and |-> are:

|+> = (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)),
|-> = (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So, the coefficients c_+ and c_- are the inner products of |alpha> with |+> and |->, respectively.

So, c_+ = < + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1) + (1/sqrt(2)) (0) ] for |up> and |down> components.

Wait, more precisely, the inner product < + | alpha > is the sum of the components:

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) * alpha_up + (1/sqrt(2)) * alpha_down.

Similarly, c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) * alpha_up + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * alpha_down.

Let me compute these.

First, compute alpha_up and alpha_down:

alpha_up = (1 + i)/sqrt(7),
alpha_down = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So,

c_+ = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 -i = 3. So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) is sqrt(14). So c_+ = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(14)).

Compute numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

Now, we need the probabilities |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 / (sqrt(14))^2 = 9 /14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. Hmm.

|c_-|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me compute the magnitudes correctly.

Because |c_+| is |3/sqrt(14)| =3/sqrt(14), so |c_+|^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857, which is about 0.643.

But 9/14 is 0.642857... So approximately 0.643, which is close to option A's 0.64, but let's see the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357143. So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. But none of the options exactly match, except perhaps option A, but 0.64 and 0.36 don't match exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, c_+ is (alpha_up + alpha_down) / sqrt(2).

So alpha_up + alpha_down = (1 +i + 2 -i)/sqrt(7) → (3)/sqrt(7).

So when I take the inner product, (3/sqrt(7)) divided by sqrt(2) → 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) → 3/sqrt(14).

So |c_+|^2 is (9)/(14) = 0.642857, yes.

c_- is (alpha_up - alpha_down)/sqrt(2).

Which is ( (1 +i) - (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) → (1 +i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i ) → so ( -1 +2i ) / sqrt(7) → divided by sqrt(2):

( -1 +2i )/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) → ( -1 +2i )/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

So probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14 ≈0.357143.

Looking at the options, none of the options exactly match this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. The probabilities would be 0.64 and 0.36, which sum to 1 (0.64+0.36=1.0), but my calculated probabilities sum to 14/14 =1, so that's correct.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.35714. So
