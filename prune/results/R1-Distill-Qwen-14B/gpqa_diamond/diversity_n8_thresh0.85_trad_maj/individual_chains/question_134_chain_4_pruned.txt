Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually involves an acid reacting with a base to form water, right?

Let me read the problem again. It says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 being mixed together. I remember that neutralization reactions release heat, so the enthalpy change will be negative, which makes me think the answer is going to be one of the negative options.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck on how to approach this. I think I should first figure out how much of each acid and base we have in terms of moles because the reaction depends on the mole ratios. 

Let's start with each solution:

1. HCl: It's strong acid, so it will fully dissociate. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-.
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
   - Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since it's a 1:1 ratio, that's 0.1 moles of H+.

2. H2SO4: It's also a strong acid, but it's diprotic. So it will donate 2 H+ ions per molecule, right?
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M.
   - Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from this is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

3. Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH-.
   - Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M.
   - Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is between H+ and OH- to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change (ΔH) for each mole of H2O formed is usually around -57.3 kJ/mol, but I think sometimes it's given as -55.8 kcal/mol. Wait, the options have both kcal and kJ, so I need to be careful about the units.

Wait, let me get that straight. I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O. But sometimes it's given per mole of H+ as well. Wait no, each mole of H+ (from an acid) reacting with a mole of OH- produces one mole of H2O, so the ΔH is per mole of H+.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. So the total H+ and OH- will determine how much reaction occurs.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it'll donate all its H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ will be released. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all OH- will be available.

So, the total H+ is 0.28 moles, and the total OH- is 0.2 moles. So when mixed, they'll react in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but wait, which one is in excess? Let me calculate.

H+ moles = 0.28 mol
OH- moles = 0.2 mol

The OH- will be the limiting reagent because 0.2 < 0.28. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of H2O. The remaining H+ (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles) will be in excess, but they don't contribute to the neutralization.

Wait, but wait a moment. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives two H+. But in the reaction, each OH- neutralizes one H+. So the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 moles, and HCl gives 0.1, making 0.28. The OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 H+ will be neutralized, leaving 0.08 H+.

So for the neutralization, the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

Now, the enthalpy change is the moles of H2O formed multiplied by the enthalpy per mole. The standard value is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O (or per mole of H+). So for 0.2 moles, ΔH = 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but my calculation is in kJ, not kcal.
