Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles like electrons scatter off a target, their scattering can be described using something called phase shifts. The problem gives me phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ with specific values. It says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess I only consider these five.

The question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, I think the scattering amplitude is related to something called the T-matrix in quantum mechanics. Right, the T-matrix is used in scattering theory to describe how particles interact. The scattering amplitude f is related to the T-matrix by f(k', k) = (2m/(4πħ²)) * T(k', k) * (1/(2k)), something like that. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach comes to mind. The optical theorem might be relevant here. The optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. But wait, the problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is the forward direction. So maybe the optical theorem is the way to go.

The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (k'=k, direction same as incident) is proportional to the total cross-section. The formula is Im(f(θ=0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total, where k is the wave number of the incident particle.

So to find Im(f), I need to find σ_total and then multiply by k/(4π). But wait, how do I get σ_total from the phase shifts? Oh right, the total cross-section can be calculated using the phase shifts. The formula for the total cross-section in terms of phase shifts is σ_total = 4π ∑ ( (2l +1)/(2) ) ( δ_l ), where the sum is over all the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l. But wait, that doesn't look quite right. No, wait, the total cross-section from phase shifts is given by σ_total = 4π ∑ [ (2l + 1)/(2) ] [ ( δ_l ) ]? Or is it [ (2l +1)/(2) ] times ( δ_l )?

Wait, no. I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude f has terms involving e^{2iδ_l} -1, and the total cross-section is the sum over all l of (4π/(k)) times ( (2l+1)/2 ) times sin(2δ_l). Or wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's try to recall: the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is (4π/k) times the imaginary part of f(θ=0). And the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is given by summing over l the terms (2l+1)/(2) times sin(2δ_l). Or wait, maybe the imaginary part is (k/(4π)) * Im(f) = (1/2) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact formula.

Alternatively, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is (k/(4π)) multiplied by the total cross-section. But to get the total cross-section from the phase shifts, I think the formula is sigma_total = 4π * sum[(2l +1)/(2k)] * sin(2 delta_l), but I'm not sure about the factors.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the formula for the total cross-section as sigma_total = (4π/k) * sum_{l} ( (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) / 2. So sigma_total = 2π sum ( (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) / k.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the correct formula. From what I recall, the optical theorem gives the total cross-section as sigma_total = 4π/k * Im(f_0), where f_0 is the forward scattering amplitude. Alternatively, sigma_total = 4π/k * sum_l ( (2l +1)/2 ) sin(2 delta_l).

Yes, that sounds right. So sigma_total = 4π/k * sum_l ( (2l +1)/2 ) sin(2 delta_l). Therefore, Im(f_0) = (k/(4π)) * sigma_total = sum_l ( (2l+1)/2 ) sin(2 delta_l).

Wait, but the question is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is Im(f). So according to the optical theorem, Im(f) at theta=0 is (k/(4π)) sigma_total. And sigma_total is sum over l of (4π/k) * ( (2l +1)/2 ) sin(2 delta_l ). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me reorganize. The formula I think is correct is:

Im(f) = (k/(4π)) * sigma_total.

And sigma_total is given by sigma_total = 4π/k * sum_l [ (2l +1)/2 * sin(2δ_l) ].

So substituting sigma_total into Im(f):

Im(f) = (k/(4π)) * [4π/k * sum_l ( (2l+1)/2 sin(2δ_l) ) ]

Simplifying, the k and 4π terms cancel out.

Im(f) = sum_l ( (2l+1)/2 * sin(2δ_l) )

So that's the formula I need to use.

Now, the phase shifts given are:

delta_0 = 90 degrees,
delta_1 = 67 degrees,
delta_2 = 55 degrees,
delta_3 = 30 degrees,
delta_4 = 13 degrees.

I think the indices correspond to l=0,1,2,3,4 respectively. Because typically, the phase shifts are labeled by l, the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

So each term in the sum is (2l+1)/2 multiplied by sin(2δ_l), for l=0 to 4.

Let me compute each term:

For l=0:
(2*0 +1)/2 = 1/2
sin(2 * 90 degrees) = sin(180°) = 0. So this term is 1/2 * 0 = 0.

l=1:
(2*1 +1)/2 = 3/2
sin(2 *67) = sin(134 degrees) ≈ sin(180-46)= sin(46) ≈ 0.7193
So term is 3/2 * 0.7193 ≈ 1.07895

l=2:
(5)/2 = 2.5
sin(2*55)=sin(110)=sin(180-70)=sin70≈0.9397
Term: 2.5 * 0.9397≈2.349

l=3:
(7)/2=3.5
sin(2*30)=sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660
Term: 3.5 * 0.8660≈3.031

l=4:
(9)/2=4.5
sin(2*13)=sin(26)≈0.4384
Term: 4.5 * 0.4384≈1.9728

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 0
l=1: ~1.07895
l=2: ~2.349
l=3: ~3.031
l=4: ~1.9728

Sum = 0 + 1.07895 +2.349 = 3.42795; 3.42795 +3.031=6.45895; +1.9728=8.43175

So the sum is approximately 8.43175.

But wait, I thought the formula for Im(f) is sum ( (2l+1)/2 sin(2δ_l) ), which is exactly what I did. So Im(f) = 8.43175.

But wait, the units. The scattering amplitude f has units of inverse length (fm⁻¹?), but wait, the options are in fm. Hmm, but wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam. So we have Im(f) = 8.43175 (in what units?) Because the actual calculation depends on the energy.

Wait a second, I think I missed a step because the calculation so far gives Im(f) in terms of some dimensionless quantity, but in reality, the amplitude is in units of inverse length. Oh wait, but the formula I used gives Im(f) in terms of (k/(4π)) * sigma_total, which I think is correct.

Wait, but wait, the formula for Im(f) is:

Im(f) = sum [ (2l +1)/2 * sin(2 delta_l) ]

But I think I might have made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me re-derive it quickly.

The optical theorem says that:

Im(f) = (k/(4π)) * sigma_total.

And sigma_total is given by:

sigma_total = 4π/k * sum [ (2l +1)/2 * sin(2 delta_l) ]

So substituting sigma_total into Im(f):

Im(f) = (k/(4π)) * [ 4π/k * sum(...) ] = sum(...)

So Im(f) = sum [ (2l +1)/2 * sin(2 delta_l) ]

So that part is correct. But wait, that gives Im(f) in terms of (something) but without considering the actual energy or the units.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of [fm], because cross-section is in [fm²], and f is dimensionless times inverse momentum, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the scattering amplitude f(k, k') has units of [fm⁻¹], but when multiplied by (2m/(4πħ²)), which is [MeV fm], it gives the T-matrix in proper units. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is f, and the options are in fm. But from the calculation, Im(f) is a dimensionless number? No, that can't be right because the options have units.

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because f is in units of [fm⁻¹], but the formula I used gives the sum of terms, which is unitless. So perhaps I'm missing a factor that should include the energy or the wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definition of the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude f is given in terms of the T-matrix via:

f(k, k') = (2m/(4πħ²)) * (1/(2k)) * T(k, k')

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that the phase shifts are related to the scattering amplitude, perhaps I should use the fact that the scattering amplitude's imaginary part in the forward direction is given by:

Im(f) = - (1/(2k)) * sum [ (2l + 1) sin(2 delta_l) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach. The scattering amplitude in partial waves is:

f = sum_{l} ( (2l +1) / (2k) ) [ e^{2i delta_l} - 1 ]

So when theta=0, and for elastic scattering, the amplitude is:

f = sum_{l} ( (2l +1) / (2k) ) [ e^{2i delta_l} -1 ]

Taking the imaginary part:

Im(f) = sum_{l} ( (2l +1)/(2k) ) [ sin(2 delta_l) ]

So that's the correct formula for Im(f).

Wait, so I think I missed the 1/(2k) factor earlier. So the correct formula is:

Im(f) = sum [ (2l +1)/(2k) ) * sin(2 delta_l) ]

Ah, so previously, I omitted the 1/(2k) factor. So now I need to include that.

So now, the steps are:

1. Calculate each term as (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2 delta_l)
2. Sum all these terms to get Im(f)
3. The answer will be in units of [fm⁻¹], but the options are in [fm], so perhaps I need to consider that the wavelength k is in [fm⁻¹] and then the units work out?

Wait, let me think about the units. The scattering amplitude f has units of [fm⁻¹], because it's a dimensionless quantity multiplied by 1/(k), and k is in [fm⁻¹].

So the options are in [fm], which suggests that perhaps the correct answer is the reciprocal of the amplitude, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor involving the energy.

Wait, the question gives the energy as 50 MeV electrons. So I need to compute k, the wave number, using this energy.

Yes, that's probably the missing piece. So let's compute k first.

The energy of the electrons is 50 MeV. The mass of the electron is m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

So the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, and the total energy E is 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV. But since 50 is much larger than 0.511, perhaps we can approximate E ≈ 50 MeV.

The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but wait, better to use the relativistic formula. Wait, electrons at 50 MeV are relativistic, so maybe we should use the relativistic relation.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

But since the electrons are in the lab frame, and we can assume they're moving with momentum p, so E = sqrt( p² c^4 + m² c^4 )

But perhaps it's easier to use the non-relativistic approximation since 50 MeV is way higher than the rest mass, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation E = ħ c k, which holds for photons, but for electrons it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps using the relativistic expression for k.

In natural units (ħ = c = 1), the momentum p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ), so p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9975 MeV/c.

So, p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

k is given by p/(ħ c). But wait, in natural units, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 50 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

So, k ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) = sqrt(2500 - 0.2611) = sqrt(2499.7389) ≈ 49.99737 MeV/c.

So k = p/(ħ c) = (49.99737 MeV/c) / (197.329 MeV fm) ) 

Because ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = 49.99737 / 197.329 ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Now, let's compute each term.

Each term is (2l +1)/(2k) * sin(2 delta_l).

So, let's go through each l:

l=0:
(2*0 +1)/(2k) = 1/(2k) = 1/(2 * 0.2534) ≈ 1/0.5068 ≈ 1.973 fm

sin(2 delta_0) = sin(180 degrees) = 0. So the term is 1.973 * 0 = 0.

l=1:
(3)/(2k) =3/(2*0.2534) ≈ 3/0.5068 ≈5.915 fm

sin(2 delta_1) = sin(134 degrees) ≈ 0.7193.
Term:5.915 * 0.7193 ≈4.271 fm.

l=2:
