Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of what affects the probability of a transit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So Planet_1's period is P1, and P2 is 3P1. They both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh right, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The options suggest either Planet_1 or 2 is better, with different probabilities.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting is related to the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. I think the formula involves the orbital inclination. For a transit to happen, the planet's orbital plane needs to be edge-on relative to us. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle of our line of sight.

The probability is sometimes approximated as (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that might not be exactly correct. Another thought: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just (R_star / a). But wait, I think the exact formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Maybe it's the ratio R_star / a, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit, considering the geometry. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R*/a) * (1/(sin i)), but wait, I think more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R*/a) * (1/(a star's radius)), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the formula for the probability P of a transit is approximately (R_*/a) where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet needs to pass
