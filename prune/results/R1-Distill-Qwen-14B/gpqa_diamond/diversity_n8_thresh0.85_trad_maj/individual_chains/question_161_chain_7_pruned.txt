Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

The question is about the mean free path of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. So, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum, but some gas particles are still present. He measured the mean free path as λ1 using factors like volume, pressure, and temperature. But when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path becomes λ2, and it's different from λ1. The temperature remained the same, so that's not a factor.

Hmm, I remember that the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, it's longer because there are fewer molecules to collide with. But wait, the initial MFP is λ1, and when the electron beam is on, it changes to λ2.

I think the electron beam might interact with the gas molecules in some way. Oh right! When a high-energy electron beam passes through gas molecules, it can cause scattering. There's something called the mean free path for electrons as they pass through a material, which depends on the density of the material and the electrons' energy.

Wait, but in this case, the gas molecules are in the vacuum chamber. So when Mike turns on the electron beam, the electrons are moving through the gas. The electrons can scatter off the gas molecules, right? But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The question is about the gas molecules' mean free path after the electron beam is on. So, the MFP of the gas is λ2. What's causing λ2 to change?

Oh, maybe when the electron beam is on, it heats the gas molecules through collisions. Because electrons hitting the gas would transfer energy, causing the gas to heat up. So the temperature of the gas might increase, which affects the MFP.

Wait, the mean free path formula for gases is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and P is pressure. So if temperature increases, λ should increase. But wait, initially, Mike's setup had a certain λ1. If the electron beam causes the gas to heat, then T increases, so λ would go up. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait
