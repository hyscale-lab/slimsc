Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty of P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. Oh, right! Because the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the given state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. So if the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, then the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ should be the eigenvalue corresponding to that state.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. But the basis vectors are for P_z. So the state is expressed as a linear combination of P_z's eigenvectors.

So I should express the state in terms of the eigenstates of P_z, then find the expectation value and variance.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So each component of the state corresponds to the coefficient of each eigenvector of P_z.

So the state |ψ> is written as a linear combination of |e1>, |e2>, |e3>, where these are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component in the column vector is the amplitude for each eigenstate.

Therefore, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute the weighted average of the eigenvalues of P_z, using the square of the absolute value of the components as probabilities.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. Let's look at the given state vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, is that a unit vector? Let me check.

The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.

So each component corresponds to the expansion coefficient in the P_z basis. That means the state is a combination of the eigenstates |e1>, |e2>, |e3> with respective coefficients.

Wait, but what are the eigenvalues of P_z? Let me look at the matrix of P_z given. The matrix is diagonal, I think. The first row has (ħ, 0, 0), the second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So P_z has eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors |1> = (1,0,0), |2>=(0,1,0), |3>=(0,0,1).

So the state is |ψ> = (-1/2)|1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3>.

Therefore, the probability of each eigenvalue is |coeff|^2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is sum (eigenvalue * probability).

So for ħ: coefficient is -1/2, so probability is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So contribution is ħ * 1/4.

For 0: coefficient is 1/√2, probability is 1/2. So contribution is 0 * 1/2 = 0.

For -ħ: coefficient is -1/2, probability 1/4. Contribution is (-ħ) * 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now ⟨P_z²⟩ would be sum (eigenvalue^2 * probability).

Each eigenvalue squared: (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 → all are ħ², 0, ħ².

So contributions: ħ² * 1/4 + 0 * 1/2 + ħ² * 1/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ², ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. So the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = 1/2 ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't confuse the basis. Oh, because the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value of P_z is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues as I did. So yeah, that's correct.

So the options are:

A) sqrt(2)ħ ≈1.414ħ

B) ħ/sqrt(2) ≈0.707ħ

C) ħ/2 =0.5 ħ

D) ħ.

So the answer is B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state given by the column vector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$, which is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the standard basis vectors $|1\rangle = (1, 0, 0)$, $|2\rangle = (0, 1, 0)$, and $|3\rangle = (0, 0, 1)$, respectively.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, with the weights being the probabilities of the system being in each eigenstate. The probabilities are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in the state vector:

- For the eigenvalue $\hbar$: Coefficient $-1/2$, probability $\left(-1/2\right)^2 = 1/4$.
- For the eigenvalue $0$: Coefficient $1/\sqrt{2}$, probability $\left(1/\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 1/2$.
- For the eigenvalue $-\hbar$: Coefficient $-1/2$, probability $\left(-1/2\right)^2 = 1/4$.

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + (-\hbar) \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, with the same weights as above. The eigenvalues squared are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$.

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \hbar^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
