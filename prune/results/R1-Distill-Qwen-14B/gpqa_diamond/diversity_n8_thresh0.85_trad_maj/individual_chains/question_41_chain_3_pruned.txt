Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when light moves from one medium to another, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, this isn't just about moving from one medium to another; the medium itself (the glass) is moving. So I think I need to consider the effects of both the refractive index and the movement of the glass.

In a vacuum, light's speed is c, which is given as 1 here. When light is in a medium with refractive index n, its speed is c/n. So normally, without any movement, the speed would be 1/n. But since the glass is moving, I think I need to use some kind of velocity addition formula, maybe from special relativity, but wait, since the speed of the glass is v, which is probably much less than c, maybe non-relativistic approximations can be used. But I'm not sure; perhaps it's best to think in terms of classical mechanics first.

Wait, in the frame of the lab, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is inside the glass, which is moving. So how do I find the speed of the light in the lab frame?

Let me think: When the glass is stationary, the light moves at c/n. But when the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, the light's speed relative to the lab would be affected by the movement of the glass.

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how do I transform the velocities?

Ah, right, this is a problem of relative motion. So if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and in the glass frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n toward the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab frame would see the light moving at v_light + v? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, no, velocity addition isn't as simple as just adding when you're considering the speed. Because velocities don't just add linearly in relativity, but since v is probably much smaller than c, and the speed of light in glass is already less than c, perhaps we can use a classical approach.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which is less than c. So in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is c/n in the same direction as the glass's movement. From the lab's perspective, since the glass is moving at velocity v, the light's velocity would be v + (c/n), right?

Wait, but that can't be right, because if the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then the light's speed should be higher than c/n. Or wait, no. Let me clarify the setup.

The glass is moving toward the observer and in the same direction as the beam. Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving
