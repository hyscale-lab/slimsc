Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because relativity isn't my strongest topic. But let's give it a shot. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. I'm told that X is lithium with 3 neutrons, so I guess that's Li-6 or something. 

Wait, lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

The formula I remember for relativistic energy is the total energy E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v. Since v is given as 0.96c, I need to calculate gamma for that speed.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, what's sqrt(0.0784)? Let me think. I remember that 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714... Wait, 1/0.28 is about 3.57142857. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 *3.57142857 is approximately 1? Let me check 0.28 * 3.57142857. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 0.57142857 is approximately 0.28 * 0.5714 is about 0.16. So total is around 1, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) again. Let me think, 0.282 squared is 0.282 *0.282. 0.2 * 0.2 is 0.04, 0.2*.08 is 0.016, 0.08*.2 is 0.016, and 0.08*.08 is 0.0064. Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Alternatively, using calculator steps: 0.0784 = (0.28)^2, so sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28= 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

But wait, let me double-check with more precise calculation. Let me compute 1 - (v²/c²) where v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

Now, sqrt(0.0784)= 0.28, so gamma=1/0.28= 3.571428571428...

So gamma is about 3.5714286.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6, so it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², but wait, is that the mass? Or is that the rest energy? Oh, right, the rest energy is m0*c². So each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV. Similarly for neutrons, their rest mass is about 939.565 MeV/c², I think. But wait, perhaps for the nucleus, the total rest mass is not simply 6 times the mass of a proton. Because in reality, the nucleus's mass is slightly less due to binding energy. But wait, the problem doesn't give any specific data, so I think I'm supposed to assume that the mass is approximately the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Or perhaps it's better to use the atomic mass unit.

Wait, but the question is about the energy of the collider. So the energy per nucleus would be gamma * m * c², where m is the rest mass of the nucleus.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the units. The question gives options in GeV, so I need to make sure my calculations are in GeV.

So first, what's the rest mass energy of a Li-6 nucleus?

Li has an atomic number of 3, so a Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c², each neutron about 939.565 MeV/c². So total rest mass would be 3*(938 + 939.565) MeV? Wait, no, protons and neutrons have similar masses. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 isotope.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe an alternative approach is to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons. So, 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², each neutron about 939.565 MeV/c².

Wait, let me check: the proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So, for 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

But wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than this because of the binding energy. Oh, right, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (E=mc², so binding energy is released when the nucleus forms, so the mass is less).

But since the problem doesn't provide the exact mass of Li-6, perhaps it's intended to assume that the rest mass of the nucleus is approximately the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Or maybe they want us to use the atomic mass in some way. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the nucleus as a single particle with mass m = 6u * c², where u is the atomic mass unit. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So for a mass number A=6, the rest mass energy would be 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is about 5.589 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass data. Let me think, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014102 atomic mass units. So 6.014102 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u would give the rest energy in MeV.

So 6.014102 * 931.5 MeV = let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.014102 *931.5 is about 13.15 MeV. So total is approximately 5589 +13.15 = 5602.15 MeV, which is 5.60215 GeV.

So the rest mass energy m0c² is approximately 5.60215 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the given data, but I think using the exact atomic mass would give a more precise answer.

So, the formula for the total energy is E = gamma * m0c².

So gamma is approximately 3.5714, and m0c² is about 5.60215 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.60215 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 *5 is 17.857. 3.5714 *0.60215 is approximately 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284, and 3.5714 *0.00215 is about 0.00766. So 2.14284 + 0.00766 is about 2.1505. So total E is approximately 17.857 + 2.1505 = 19.0075 GeV?

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 19 GeV. Wait, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and D is 21.419.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.5714 *5.60215 more precisely.

Let me do it step by step:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 *0.00215 = 0.00766 approximately.

Adding 17.857 +2.14284 = 19.99984, plus 0.00766 is approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419. So 20.0075 is close to option C, but let me check more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Because perhaps my initial assumption of sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 is exactly correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

So let's compute 3.5714285714 *5.60215 GeV.

Wait, 3.5714 *5.60215 → Let me multiply 3.5714 by 5.60215.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857, 3.5714 *0.6=2.14284, 3.5714 *0.00215=0.00766. So adding all together: 17.857 +2.14284 =19.99984, plus 0.00766 is 20.0075 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps the rest mass is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 *931.5 MeV = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 is 5589, 0.014102 *931.5 = let's compute 14.102 *931.5 / 1000. Wait, wait, 0.014102 *931.5 = (0.01 *931.5) + (0.004102 *931.5).

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.004102 *931.5 = let's see: 0.004 *931.5=3.726, and 0.000102 *931.5≈0.0949. So total for 0.004102 is 3.726+0.0949=3.8209.

So 9.315 +3.8209 =13.1359 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5589 +13.1359 =5602.1359 MeV → 5.6021359 GeV.

So m0c² is 5.6021359 GeV.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

So E = gamma * m0c² =3.5714285714 *5.6021359 GeV.

Let me calculate this more accurately.

5.6021359 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6021359 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.0021359 *3.57142857 ≈0.00763.

Adding 17.85714285 +2.14285714 =20. So 20 plus 0.00763 is approximately 20.00763 GeV.

Wait, but my initial calculation was about 20.0075 GeV. So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, my calculation is about 20.0075 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132) or perhaps another option. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let's consider the exact value. Maybe the actual mass is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for gamma. Let me recalculate gamma using more precise numbers.

v =0.96c.

So beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

Wait, but perhaps I can calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^2 exactly: 0.96 *0.96= 0.9216. 1-0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so no error there. So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

Wait, so E =3.5714285714 *5.6021359 GeV.

Let me compute 3.571428571428571 *5.6021359 precisely.

Breaking it down:

5 *3.571428571428571 =17.857142857142854.

0.6021359 *3.571428571428571.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142857142.

0.0021359 *3.57142857= let me compute 0.002 *3.57142857=0.00714285714, and 0.0001359 *3.57142857≈0.00048506.

Adding 0.00714285714 and 0.00048506 gives approximately 0.007627917.

So 0.6021359 *3.57142857≈2.14285714 +0.007627917=2.150485057.

Adding all together: 17.857142857 +2.150485057 =20.007627914 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. But wait, this is about 0.124 GeV less than option C. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, the mass I used was Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of a different isotope. Wait, the question says nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6, yeah.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact mass of Li-6. Let me look it up: the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 u * 931.5 MeV/u =?

Calculating 6.014102 *931.5.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.014102 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.004102 *931.5= 3.820887.

Add 9.315 +3.820887=13.135887.

So 5589 +13.135887=5602.135887 MeV → 5.602135887 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy between the calculation and the options? The calculated value is approximately 20.0076 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C (20.132 GeV), but it's about 0.124 GeV higher.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate the rest mass. Maybe I should use the mass of the bare nucleus without electrons, but I think the problem treats the nucleus as a single entity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the nucleus as a particle with a certain mass, but I might have made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) more precisely.

Wait, let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 =1-0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute E as 3.571428571428571 *5.602135887 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.571428571428571 * 5.602135887.

Let me compute step by step:

First, 3.571428571428571 *5 =17.857142857142854.

Next, 3.571428571428571 *0.602135887.

Compute 3.571428571428571 *0.6 =2.142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 *0.002135887 = ?

Let me compute 3.571428571428571 *0.002 =0.007142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 *0.000135887 = approximately 0.000485.

Adding 0.007142857142857142 and 0.000485 gives approximately 0.007627857.

So 3.571428571428571 *0.602135887 ≈2.142857142857142 +0.007627857 =2.150485.

So adding to the 17.857142857142854, total E is 17.857142857142854 +2.150485 =20.007627857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

But none of the options match this exactly. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.124 GeV higher. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic corrections or other factors. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to use the rest mass of a single nucleon, but that doesn't make sense for a nucleus.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy instead of the total energy? No, the question says 'energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c'. RHIC accelerates ions, so the total energy is the kinetic plus rest mass energy. But the question is about the total energy, I believe.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Looking it up, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.602135887 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with more precise numbers. Let me try a different approach using exact calculations.

Compute E = gamma * m0 * c².

Gamma = 3.571428571428571.

m0c² =5.602135887 GeV.

E =3.571428571428571 *5.602135887.

Let me compute 3.571428571428571 *5.602135887.

Let me compute this as:

3.571428571428571 × 5.602135887 = ?

Let me compute this multiplication using a step-by-step approach.

First, 3 ×5.602135887 =16.80640766.

0.571428571428571 ×5.602135887.

Compute 0.5 ×5.602135887 =2.8010679435.

0.071428571428571 ×5.602135887 = 0.071428571428571 *5.602135887.

Wait, 5.602135887 *0.071428571428571 = ?

0.071428571428571 is approximately 1/14.

So 5.602135887 /14 = approx 0.400152563357.

So adding all up:

16.80640766 (from 3×5.602135887)

+2.8010679435 (from 0.5×5.602135887)

+0.400152563357 (from 0.071428571428571×5.602135887)

Total: 16.80640766 +2.8010679435 =19.6074756035 +0.400152563357=20.0076281669 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

But the options don't have this number. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mass.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus's mass is actually higher. Let me think. If the actual mass is higher, say around 6u, then m0c² would be 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV →5.589 GeV.

If I use that, then E =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589 =?

0.5 *3.57142857 =1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857=0.2857142856.

0.009 *3.57142857=0.03214285713.

Adding them: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856=2.0714285706 +0.03214285713=2.1035714277.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.1035714277=19.9607142777 GeV. About 19.96 GeV. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately using the exact expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think: the energy of the collider would be the total energy per nucleus, which is gamma * m_nucleus * c².

But perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy (K) rather than the total energy (E). Because sometimes people refer to the kinetic energy when talking about particle accelerators. No, I think the question is about the total energy because it's the energy of the collider, which would include the rest mass.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to compute just the kinetic energy. Let me think: the kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m0 c².

If I compute that, K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.602135887 GeV.

So 2.57142857 *5.602135887.

2.57142857 *5 =12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.602135887 ≈ 2.57142857 *0.6=1.542857142, and 2.57142857 *0.002135887≈0.005492.

Adding 1.542857142 +0.005492≈1.548349.

So K ≈12.85714285 +1.548349≈14.40549 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So probably, the question is about the total energy, not the kinetic.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should check the options again.

Options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-beta squared is 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.57142857142857, but perhaps when multiplied by the mass, it rounds to 20.0076 GeV. However, none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the rest mass of a different isotope or a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-calculate using the exact values.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula.

E = gamma * m0 c².

m0 is the rest mass of the nucleus, which is 6.014102 u.

So 6.014102 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.014102 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.014102 *931.5= let's compute 14.102 *931.5 /1000.

14 *931.5 =12,  14*900=12,600, 14*31.5=441 → 12,600+441=13,041. 0.102 *931.5=94.993.

So 14.102 *931.5=13,041 +94.993=13,135.993 MeV.

Wait, no, wait: 14.102 *931.5 is (14 +0.102)*931.5 =14*931.5 +0.102*931.5.

14*931.5=13,041.

0.102 *931.5=94.  931.5 *0.1=93.15; 931.5 *0.002=1.863 → 93.15+1.863=95.013.

So 14.102*931.5=13,041 +95.013 =13,136.013 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13,136.013 =18,725.013 MeV →18.725013 GeV.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6.014102 u is 6 u + 0.014102 u. So 6 u is 6 *931.5 =5,589 MeV. 0.014102 u is 0.014102 *931.5 MeV = approximately 13.136 MeV. So total m0c²=5,589 +13.136=5,602.136 MeV →5.602136 GeV.

Ah, so I made a mistake earlier. The correct m0c² is 5.602136 GeV, not 5.602135887 GeV. So perhaps this slight difference can affect the calculation.

So E =3.57142857 *5.602136 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.602136.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.602136.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.002136 = ?

0.002 *3.57142857 =0.00714285714.

0.000136 *3.57142857 ≈0.000486.

So 0.00714285714 +0.000486≈0.00762885714.

Adding to 2.14285714 gives 2.14285714 +0.00762885714=2.150485997.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.150485997=20.007628847 GeV.

Again, about 20.0076 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.124 GeV higher than what I calculated. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different value for c or for the mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the rest mass of a proton and neutron but not considering the actual isotope. Let me try that approach.

If each proton is 938 MeV/c² and each neutron is 939.565 MeV/c², then for Li-6 (3 protons and 3 neutrons):

3*(938) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938 +939.565) → 3*(1877.565) =5632.695 MeV →5.632695 GeV.

Then, E =3.57142857 *5.632695 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.632695.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.632695.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.002695 *3.57142857≈0.00964.

Adding 2.142857142 +0.107142857=2.25, 2.25 +0.00964=2.25964.

So E=17.85714285 +2.25964=20.11678 GeV.

That's closer to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.632695 more accurately.

5.632695 ×3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 5 ×3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.632695 ×3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.03 ×3.57142857 =0.1071428571.

0.002695 ×3.57142857.

0.002 ×3.57142857=0.00714285714.

0.000695 ×3.57142857≈0.002499.

Adding these together: 0.00714285714 +0.002499≈0.00964185714.

So total 0.632695 ×3.57142857≈2.142857142 +0.1071428571=2.25 +0.00964185714=2.2596418571.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.2596418571=20.116784707 GeV.

So approximately 20.11678 GeV, which is about 20.1168 GeV.

Looking at option C, it's 20.132 GeV, which is very close but a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation considering the precise values would yield this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the rest mass and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic energy formula without considering the binding energy, thus using a mass of 6u, leading to m0c²=5.589 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV = ?

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589= ? Let me compute 0.5 ×3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.08 ×3.57142857=0.2857142856.

0.009 ×3.57142857=0.03214285713.

Adding these: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856=2.0714285706 +0.03214285713=2.1035714277.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.1035714277=19.9607142777 GeV.

Which rounds to about 19.96 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the nucleons' masses, leading to about 20.1168 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Alternatively, perhaps the precise calculation with more decimal places would result in option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, and my calculations are slightly off due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the kinetic energy, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using precise gamma and precise mass.

Gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

Mass is 5.602135887 GeV.

E =3.571428571428571 *5.602135887 = ?

Let me compute it using precise arithmetic.

Multiply 3.571428571428571 by 5.602135887.

Let me compute 3.571428571428571 ×5 =17.857142857142854.

3.571428571428571 ×0.602135887.

Compute 3.571428571428571 ×0.6 =2.142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 ×0.002135887 = ?

0.002 ×3.571428571428571 =0.007142857142857142.

0.000135887 ×3.571428571428571 ≈0.000485.

So 0.007142857142857142 + 0.000485≈0.007627857142857142.

So total 3.571428571428571 ×0.602135887 =2.142857142857142 +0.007627857142857142=2.1504849999999993.

Adding to the 17.857142857142854:

17.857142857142854 +2.1504849999999993=20.00762785714285 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) 20.132 GeV, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6 again. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. So the rest mass energy is 6.014102 ×931.5 MeV/u → let me compute that precisely.

6.014102 ×931.5 = ?

Compute 6 ×931.5 =5,589 MeV.

0.014102 ×931.5 = let me calculate 0.01 ×931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.004102 ×931.5 = compute 0.004 ×931.5=3.726 MeV.

0.000102 ×931.5=0.094923 MeV.

So 9.315 +3.726=13.041 +0.094923=13.135923 MeV.

So total is 5,589 +13.135923=5,602.135923 MeV →5.602135923 GeV.

So m0c²=5.602135923 GeV.

Now, E =gamma * m0c² =3.571428571428571 ×5.602135923.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.571428571428571 ×5 =17.857142857142854.

3.571428571428571 ×0.602135923.

Compute 3.571428571428571 ×0.6 =2.142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 ×0.002135923=?

0.002 ×3.571428571428571=0.007142857142857142.

0.000135923 ×3.571428571428571 ≈0.000485.

So 0.007142857142857142 +0.000485≈0.007627857142857142.

Adding to 2.142857142857142, get 2.1504849999999993.

Adding to 17.857142857142854, total E=20.00762785714285 GeV.

Still about 20.0076 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be rounded to four decimal places. 20.0076 rounded to four decimal places is 20.0076 →20.0076 GeV. But the options don't have that. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.124 GeV higher.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma again.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.571428571428571.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96. So gamma=3.571428571428571.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma. Let me compute gamma using more precise beta.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.571428571428571, but if I compute it more accurately, perhaps it's slightly different.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely. 0.0784 is 784e-4. The square root of 784 is 28, so sqrt(784e-4) is 28e-2 =0.28. So no, that's exact.

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the total energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is a single entity.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, but I don't see any option near 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem. The question asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy per ion is what's important.

Wait, but perhaps the given options don't match my calculation because the problem expects the use of the proton mass only. Let me try that.

If the nucleus is considered to have a mass equal to 6 times the proton mass (even though neutrons are slightly heavier), then m0c²=6 *938 MeV=5,628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.028 *3.57142857≈0.09999999996.

So 2.142857142 +0.09999999996≈2.24285714196.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.24285714196=20.100 GeV.

That's very close to option C (20.132 GeV). Hmm, perhaps the problem expects this approach, considering each nucleon as a proton.

So with this approach, the energy is approximately 20.100 GeV, which would round to 20.100 GeV, close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a more precise calculation. Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

3.57142857 ×5.628.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.628= let me compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.028=0.09999999996.

Adding 2.142857142 +0.09999999996=2.24285714196.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.24285714196=20.100000 GeV.

So 20.1 GeV, which is option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a slightly different approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of gamma as 3.571428571428571 and m0c² as 5.602135923 GeV.

So E=3.571428571428571 ×5.602135923.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.571428571428571 ×5.602135923.

Let me compute this as 3.571428571428571 ×5 =17.857142857142854.

3.571428571428571 ×0.602135923.

Compute 3.571428571428571 ×0.6 =2.142857142857142.

3.571428571428571 ×0.002135923= let's compute this precisely.

0.002 ×3.571428571428571=0.007142857142857142.

0.000135923 ×3.571428571428571.

Compute 0.0001 ×3.571428571428571=0.0003571428571428571.

0.000035923 ×3.571428571428571≈0.0001283.

So total 0.0003571428571428571 +0.0001283≈0.0004854428571428571.

Adding to 0.007142857142857142: 0.007142857142857142 +0.0004854428571428571≈0.00762830000000000.

Adding to 2.142857142857142: 2.142857142857142 +0.0076283=2.150485442857142.

Adding to 17.857142857142854: 17.857142857142854 +2.150485442857142≈20.0076283 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if there's a mistake in the question. But given the available options and the calculations, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass. Let me double-check. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The exact atomic mass is 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.602135887 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.602135887 =20.0076 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.124 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c². For example, using c²=9×10^16 m²/s², but that shouldn't affect the calculation since we're working in GeV units.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact value of gamma, which might be a slightly different number if computed more precisely.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

beta = 0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Compute beta^2: 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma=3.571428571428571.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not entirely sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere, but I've gone through it several times and can't find an error.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula without accounting for the entire rest mass, or perhaps I should use the rest mass of the entire nucleus as 6 *938 MeV (protons only), ignoring neutrons' slightly higher mass.

So m0c²=6*938=5,628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628= ?

3 ×0.628=1.884.

0.57142857 ×0.628=0.3583333336.

So 3.57142857 ×0.628= (3 ×0.628) + (0.57142857 ×0.628) =1.884 +0.3583333336=2.2423333336.

So E=17.85714285 +2.2423333336=20.1 GeV.

Which is 20.1 GeV, very close to option C)20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the intended approach is to use the proton mass only, leading to E=20.1 GeV, which would correspond to option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The steps are as follows:

---

### 1. **Calculate \( \gamma \):**
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857
\]

---

### 2. **Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \):**
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of Li-6 is \( 6.014102 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The rest mass energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.014102 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5602.135923 \, \text{MeV} = 5.602135923 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### 3. **Calculate the total energy \( E \):**
Substitute \( \gamma \) and \( m_0 c^2 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.602135923 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into parts:

\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285, \quad 3.57142857 \times 0.602135923 \approx 2.150485
\]

Adding these:

\[
E \approx 17.85714285 + 2.150485 = 20.00762785 \, \text{GeV}
\]

---

### 4. **Compare with the options:**
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0076 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The discrepancy between the calculated value (\( 20.0076 \, \text{GeV} \)) and option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)) is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup. Based on the given options, the closest match is **C**.

---

**Answer: C**
