Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Hmm, let's start by going through the given information step by step.

So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses don't directly affect the calculation here. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the abundance ratios provided.

The data given are:
- For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.
- For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

And the solar photospheric composition is:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or maybe the ratio of silicon in each star compared to each other. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Oh, so it's (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

Hmm, how do I get the silicon abundance for each star?

Let's think about each star individually.

Starting with Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → which means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. So, n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which means [Si/Fe] = log10(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = 0.3.

Wait, the notation can be a bit confusing. The [X/Y] notation is log10(n_X / n_Y) relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y]_star = log10(n_X/n_Y)_star - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So for Star_1:

log10(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

Which means n_Si1 / n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2 (since 10^0.3 is about 2).

Wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, right? Let me check: 10^0.3 ≈ 2 because 10^0.3010 is about 2. So yeah, 2.

But wait, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that implies that n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So from the Sun's data, n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5)
