Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It involves a Lagrangian, and I need to find the mass dimension of a certain coupling constant, κ, and determine whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I think σ matrices are antisymmetric and relate to the generators of Lorentz transformations or something like that. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action S = ∫ d^4x L has to be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So let's break down the Lagrangian term: κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Each of these fields will have their own mass dimensions.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. I remember that in four dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also have dimension 3/2 because it's the adjoint spinor, same as ψ.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for the electromagnetic field (I think, assuming this is QED-like). The field strength tensor F_{μν} is the derivative of the gauge field A, so its dimension is the same as the derivative (mass dimension 1) times A. Since A has dimension 1 (because it's a gauge field in four dimensions), F would have dimension [∂][A] = 1*(1) = 2. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. The gauge field A has dimension [A] = 1. Because in the covariant derivative D_mu = ∂_mu + i e A_mu, ∂_mu has dimension 1, so A must also have dimension 1 to make the terms in D_mu have the same dimension.

So F^{μν} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of the γ matrices and their commutators. The gamma matrices γ^mu are dimensionless because they're just matrices, right? So σ_{μν} is a product of γ's and derivatives? Wait, no. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined in terms of γ matrices. So it's (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], which is (i/2)(gamma_mu gamma_nu - gamma_nu gamma_mu). So because the gamma matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} would also be dimensionless. Oh wait, wait: the gamma matrices are like 4x4 matrices, but they don't carry any mass dimension. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

So putting this all together, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} has the product of these fields. Let me compute the mass dimension of this term.

Each ψ̄ and ψ have dimension 3/2 each. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 = 3. F^{mu nu} has dimension 2. So the entire term without κ is 3 + 2 =5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the remaining factor, κ, must contribute a dimension of 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, wait. The term is κ multiplied by the product, so the dimensions should add up. So [L] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]. So that's [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2. So 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So 5 + [κ] = 4 → [κ] = -1. That makes sense.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. Now, the next part is whether the theory is renormalizable. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. The general rule is that for a term in the Lagrangian with dimension d, the coupling has to have dimension ≤4. Wait, no, I think it's that each coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0 in 4 dimensions. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The renormalizability condition is that the dimension of the coupling (in terms of mass) must be non-negative. Because renormalizable theories require that the coupling doesn't have negative mass dimension, which would make the interaction terms nonrenormalizable (since they would have higher dimension and require more derivatives or higher powers, leading to nonrenormalizable interactions). So if the mass dimension of the coupling is negative, the theory is nonrenormalizable.

In this case, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the interaction term is higher-dimensional, making it nonrenormalizable.

So putting it together, κ has mass dimension -1, and the theory isn't renormalizable. Looking at the options, that would be option C: mass dim -1, theory not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\). 

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\), and so does its adjoint \(\bar{\psi}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) for the electromagnetic field has mass dimension \([ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2\), as it is related to the derivatives of the gauge field \(A_\mu\), which has dimension 1.
- The matrices \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) are constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices \(\gamma_\mu\), so \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M = 0\).

### Step 2: Mass Dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. The term \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) contributes the following dimensions:
- \([ \bar{\psi} ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\),
- \([ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ]_M = 0\),
- \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\),
- \([ F^{\mu\nu} ]_M = 2\).

Adding these, the total dimension of the term without \(\kappa\) is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, \(\kappa\) must compensate by contributing:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \(\kappa\) has a mass dimension of \(-1\), which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is higher-dimensional, making the theory **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
