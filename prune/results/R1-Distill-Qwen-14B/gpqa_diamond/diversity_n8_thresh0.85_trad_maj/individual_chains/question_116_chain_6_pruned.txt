Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question involves NMR spectroscopy, bromination, elimination reactions, and some stereoisomerism. Alright, let's start by reading everything carefully.

So, the problem says:

Compound A has two signals in its proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. We need to identify D from the options.

First, I should figure out what compound A is. The NMR data is crucial here. So, proton NMR with a triplet and a quartet. Let's think about the integration: 6H and 4H. The triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests that those protons are likely on a methyl group (since 0.9 is typical for CH3 groups). A quartet at 1.3 ppm could be a set of adjacent protons, maybe on a CH2 group. 

Wait, the triplet (6H) might be two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Because each triplet implies coupling with two neighboring protons. So, perhaps a structure where two methyl groups are adjacent to a CH2. Let me think: a 2,2-dimethyl structure? Or maybe a neopentyl structure?

Wait, another possibility is that the 6H triplet is from two methyl groups attached to a central CH2 group. Because 2 methyl groups give 6H, and the quartet (4H) could be the central CH2 next to them. So, like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2 something? Or maybe a longer chain.

Wait, NMR splitting: The triplet for 6H suggests that each of those protons is coupled with two others. So, for example, in a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2, the central CH would be split into a triplet by the two adjacent CH3 groups. But wait, in that case, the CH would be a quartet. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: The quartet (4H) at 1.3 ppm. Quartets usually come from coupling with three neighboring protons. But wait, quartet is when splitting is from two neighboring protons, each with two protons. So, like a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. 

Putting this together: the triplet (6H) suggests two equivalent CH3 groups, each giving a triplet when next to a CH2. The quartet (4H) would be from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. So, perhaps a structure like CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a neopentyl group? Neopentyl is (CH3)C-CH2CH2... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diethyl group. Wait, no, diethyl would have more protons. Let me think again. Maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Not likely, because cyc
