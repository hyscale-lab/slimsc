Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after a reaction. 

First, the problem states that compound X (C11H12O) was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, 403 K is pretty hot—like around 130°C. Hmm, what kind of reaction conditions are those? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, sometimes used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. But wait, if the solvent is nonpolar, that might influence the reaction mechanism or the type of product formed.

So the product's NMR data is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

And the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak around 197 ppm. That's really high. I remember that carbonyl carbons (like ketones, aldehydes, esters) are around 170-220. An epoxide oxygen would cause some deshielding, but the oxygen in an epoxide is usually around 60-70 ppm. Wait, but wait—maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the 197 ppm is a carbonyl, but what kind of carbonyl? Let me think.

Another approach: The product is formed from a reaction involving an epoxide. Let me think about what 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane does. Oh, right, it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used in the ring-opening of epoxides. Epoxide ring-opening with a base typically leads to the formation of an alkoxide, which then might form an alcohol or undergo some other reaction, depending on the conditions.

But wait, in this case, the product's NMR doesn't show any obvious signs of an alcohol (like broad peaks around 1-5 ppm), so maybe the epoxide ring didn't open via a typical acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction, like a rearrangement.

Wait, but the reaction uses a strong base and high temperature. Maybe it's a ring-opening followed by a rearrangement, like a Wagner-Meerwein shift or some other kind of carbocation rearrangement? Or perhaps a Cope rearrangement?

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bulky base, so maybe it's causing some kind of elimination or rearrangement. Let me think about epoxide ring-opening. In basic conditions, the ring opens with the base abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, forming an alkoxide which attacks the less substituted carbon of the epoxide. But if the epoxide is symmetric, maybe both sides are equally likely.

But how does this relate to the NMR data of the product? Let me think about the structure of the product. Let me analyze the NMR signals.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- Two singlets for 3H each. These are likely methyl groups attached to something deshielded, maybe aromatic rings or attached to something electronegative. Alternatively, they could be CH3 groups on sp3 carbons, perhaps attached to an oxygen. Wait, but the two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 are very close in chemical shift. Maybe they're on similar carbons, perhaps adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like an oxygen.

Wait, in the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. 21 ppm is a bit low for a CH3 adjacent to something. Maybe they're part of a ketone or an ester? Wait, but the product's molecular formula isn't given, but the starting compound is C11H12O. Wait, wait, the starting compound is X, and the product's formula isn't given. Hmm, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that might not make sense because the reaction is with a base, which might open the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening followed by a rearrangement, leading to a new structure. Maybe the product is a bicyclic compound or something else.

Wait, let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, wait—epoxides have two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, epoxide is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So, the structure is an ethylene oxide ring. So, each of the options A and B and C and D are epoxides. So the product is an epoxide. But wait, the reaction was with a base. So perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide to form something else, but the product is another epoxide? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening followed by a rearrangement to form a new epoxide, perhaps in a different position.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. Maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of the epoxide, but the product's NMR data suggests that the product is a diol? But the NMR data doesn't show any broad peaks, so maybe it's a different type of product. Let me look again.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 ppm. That's quite high. What carbons appear around there? Carbonyl carbons, like ketones. Wait, but ketones are usually around 205-220, but maybe this is an ester or an aldehyde. Wait, aldehyde carbons are around 190-210. So maybe it's an aldehyde? Or a conjugated carbonyl, maybe.

Wait, but the product is from a reaction between compound X and a base. If X is an epoxide, perhaps the base caused a ring-opening to form an alcohol, but then maybe that was oxidized? But I don't see any indication of that in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the base caused a rearrangement of the epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe I should first look at the NMR data to deduce the structure of the product.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s) are two methyl groups. The splitting is a singlet, so they're attached to a carbon with no neighboring Hs—probably attached to something that makes the environment symmetrical, like an aromatic ring or a carbonyl group.

The aromatic region has:

6.75 (1H, d)
7.08 (2H, d)
7.68 (1H, d)
7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, the two doublets at around 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) might be part of a substituted benzene ring. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, you'd have two doublets each integrating to 2H, but that's not exactly what's here. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ortho substitution, but then the coupling constants might be similar.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a styrene group or a substituted styrene. Let me think about how the coupling would work.

In a para-substituted styrene, you might have two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted group, but that would have more complex splitting.

Wait, another approach: The product's 1H NMR shows four aromatic protons: one as a doublet (1H), another as 2H doublet, then 1H and 2H doublets again. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me count the integrals:

- 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H: total 6H. So, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each of which has a certain substitution pattern. For example, if it's a para-substituted benzene, but each substituent has more than one H. Or maybe it's a biphenyl system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. The doublet at 6.75 (1H) and 7.68 (1H) could be the protons on a double bond. Wait, the 7.71 (2H, d) could be on another substituent.

Wait, the 1H NMR also has a singlet at 2.28 and 2.31 for 3H each. So perhaps these are methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring or to a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 13C NMR: the carbons at 126.9 and 127.1, 129.1, 130.3, 141.5, 144.1. Those are all in the aromatic region. Let me think about how the carbons would add up.

Wait, the product has a 13C NMR with 9 signals. So, 9 distinct carbons. Let me count:

- 21.3 (CH3)
- 28.4 (CH3)
- 126.9 (2C)
- 127.1 (1C)
- 129.1 (2C)
- 130.3 (1C)
- 141.5 (1C)
- 144.1 (1C)
