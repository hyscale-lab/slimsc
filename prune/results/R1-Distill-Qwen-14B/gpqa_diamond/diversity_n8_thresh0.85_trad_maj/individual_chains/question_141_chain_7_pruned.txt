Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused because the compound is called 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh wait, no, I think it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, wait, the "-d" might refer to something else, maybe the deuterium. Oh wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me think. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Hmm, but that seems a bit odd. Wait, but wait, the problem says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene-d, which would mean the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2, and a deuterium somewhere else? Or maybe the "d" is
