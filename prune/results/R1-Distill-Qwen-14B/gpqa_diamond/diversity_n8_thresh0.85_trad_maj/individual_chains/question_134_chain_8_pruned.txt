Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat change when an acid reacts with a base to produce one mole of water.

Wait, but first I should figure out what each of these substances contributes. Let me list them out:

- HCl: hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid. It donates H+ ions.
- H2SO4: sulfuric acid, also a strong acid. But wait, sulfuric is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-; the second dissociation is also strong, so it gives another H+ and SO4^2-.
- Ba(OH)2: barium hydroxide. This is a strong base. Since Ba is +2, each Ba(OH)2 produces two OH^- ions when dissolved. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

But wait, when mixing these, I need to find the limiting reactant because the neutralization depends on the available H+ and OH- ions. The excess might not react, but for enthalpy, maybe only the limiting one matters.

So, let's calculate the moles of each acid and base.

First, HCl: volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), concentration 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+. So, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentration 0.5 M. Moles = 0.
