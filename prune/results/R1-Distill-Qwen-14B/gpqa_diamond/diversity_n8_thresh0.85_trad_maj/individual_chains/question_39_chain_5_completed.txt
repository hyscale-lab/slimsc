Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Alright, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function given some conditions. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the wavefunction must be zero outside this region.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but wait—that's not a standard form I'm familiar with. Usually, wave functions are written as ψ(x) = something, and the modulus squared gives the probability density. But here, the wave function is written as a complex number. Wait, but the problem says that none were found at x<1 and x>3. So, the wave function must be zero in those regions, right?

Wait a second, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. I'm a bit confused. Or maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So, outside that interval, the wave function must be zero. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i when x is between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. But wait, that can't be right because the wave function shouldn't have an imaginary part if it's zero outside. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) e^{-i something}, but that's not what's written. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some exponential factor, but in the problem, it's written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and the given expression is valid in that interval.

Wait, but if that's the case, then outside x=1 and x=3, the wave function is zero. But the given wave function has a real and imaginary part. So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3. But then, I'm not sure how that fits with the given expression. Hmm, maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i only between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise. But that seems a bit odd because the wave function has both real and imaginary parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * e^{-i (something)}. But in the problem, it's written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, but I have to work with what's given.

So, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wave functions are typically complex, but in this case, perhaps the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, but then the wave function would have a constant imaginary part, which seems odd. Because the probability density is |ψ|^2, which would be (a^2/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. But that would imply that the probability is non-zero outside the region x between 1 and 3, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The problem states that when measuring the position, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So, the probability of finding the particle in those regions must be zero. That means the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3.

But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, perhaps this is the form of the wave function only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because outside, the wave function is zero. So, in the region x <1 or x>3, ψ(x)=0.

But then, when you square the modulus, the probability is zero in those regions, which fits the measurement results.

So, to find 'a', we need to normalize the wave function. Because the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, since it's a probability distribution.

So, let's write ψ(x) as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Wait, because |a + bi|² = a² + b². So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25).

So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx should equal 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, in the region where x is between 1 and 3, ψ(x) is this value. But outside, it's zero. So, the integral for normalization is from 1 to3.

So, our integral becomes:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ) ] dx = 1.

So, let's compute this integral.

First, split it into two terms:

Integral of (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3.

Let u = 1+x → du=dx. The limits become u=2 to u=4.

So, the integral is a² [ ln(u) ] from 2 to4 = a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So, adding the two integrals:

a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln2 = 1 -0.5 = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Compute ln2 ≈ 0.6931.

So, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So, a = sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So, the answer should be B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me recheck the steps because sometimes I make mistakes in signs or setup.

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, when I compute |ψ|², it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. So that part seems correct.

Integrate from 1 to3: yes.

The first integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln2. Correct.

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1)=0.5. Correct.

Sum is a² ln2 +0.5 =1 → a² = 0.5/(ln2) ≈ (0.5)/(0.6931)≈0.720.

Square root of that is a≈0.8485, which rounds to 0.85. So, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. So, perhaps I should have considered whether the wave function is normalized as a complex function. Because the modulus squared is the product of ψ and its complex conjugate.

Wait, let me recheck. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, its complex conjugate is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Then, the modulus squared is ψ*ψ = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ][ (a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i ].

Which is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(0.5i).

Wait, but wait, that's not the case. Let me compute it properly.

Actually, (a + b)(a* + b*) where a is real and b is imaginary.

Wait, no, in this case, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)) which is real, and b is -0.5i, which is imaginary.

So, ψ = a_real + b_imaginary.

So, ψ* = a_real - b_imaginary.

So, ψψ* = (a_real + b_imag)(a_real - b_imag) = a_real² + b_imag².

Because the cross terms are imaginary and they cancel out when multiplied.

So, yes, |ψ|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

So, my initial calculation was correct.

So, the integral is indeed as I did before, leading to a≈0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The problem states that no particles are found outside the region \( x \in [1, 3] \), meaning the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Thus, the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and we normalize it over this interval.

The probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is calculated as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

To normalize the wave function, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits become \( u = 2 \) to \( u = 4 \). The integral becomes:

   \[
   a^2 \int_2^4 \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_2^4 = a^2 (\ln 4 - \ln 2) = a^2 \ln 2.
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln 2 + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln 2}.
\]

Using \( \ln 2 \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( a \approx 0.85 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
