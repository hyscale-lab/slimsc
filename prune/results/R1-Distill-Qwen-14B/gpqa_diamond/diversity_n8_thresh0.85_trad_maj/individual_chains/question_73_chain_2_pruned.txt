Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their speeds because of the relativistic addition formula. Right, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same line is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down.

So the first astronaut is moving at v1 = 0.6c, the second at v2=0.5c. Both in the same direction, so the relative speed from the first's perspective would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7. 0.1/0.7 is approximately 0.1428... so about 0.14c. So the relative speed is roughly 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, actually, I think I might have mixed up the order. Because if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c in the same direction, then from the first astronaut's frame, the second would be moving at velocity (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) — no, wait, no, I think the correct formula is when you have two frames, you calculate the velocity u' in the frame moving at velocity v relative to the original frame. So if the first astronaut is at rest in their own frame, then the second astronaut's speed in that frame would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if the first astronaut is moving at v=0.6c relative to the lab frame,
