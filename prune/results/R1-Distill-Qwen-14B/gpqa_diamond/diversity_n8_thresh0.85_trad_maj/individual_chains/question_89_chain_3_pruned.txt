Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what happens.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

So, what reaction could this be? Heating a dibromide with KOH usually leads to elimination, like dehydrohalogenation. If two bromines are present, maybe a double elimination occurs, forming an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules upon elimination. So that would form a diene? Or maybe an allene? Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl signal, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so perhaps the bromines are on adjacent carbons. When KOH is heated, it could cause elimination to form a carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes, but with two leaving groups, perhaps a ring expansion or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridged structure with a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The adamantane structure is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent bridgeheads. Heating with KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction. But maybe in this case, two eliminations occur, eliminating two HBr molecules and forming a bridgehead double bond or a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double dehydrohalogenation to form an allene, but that's less likely because bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to the Bredt's rule. So maybe the product is a ketone instead.

Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-type elimination. But pinacol involves vicinal diols, which isn't the case here. Wait, but in this case, we have two bromides on the adamantane.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. That suggests that the product is a ketone. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of cyclization or rearrangement to form a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the two bromides are removed, and the resulting structure has a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps it's a case of double elimination, but forming a carbonyl. Wait, how?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, each loss of HBr forms a bridgehead carbocation, which could rearrange. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination to form an allene, but since bridgehead allenes are not possible, the structure must rearrange. Maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a more stable structure with a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbene or some other intermediate.

Alternatively, wait, think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's a ketone where the adjacent CH2 groups are deshielded, so that's why they show up at 4.79. Wait, no, because a ketone would have carbonyl adjacent to CH2, which would typically be around 2-3 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's an alcohol, but the IR is 1720 which is more likely a ketone or ester.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone? No, because the IR would show two peaks then. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridged ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is adamantanone. Let me think: adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. If one of the bridgehead carbons is oxidized to a carbonyl, that might fit. But how?

Wait, wait, let's think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes two elimination steps. Each elimination would lose HBr, forming a double bond. But if the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, forming a double bond between them isn't possible due to Bredt's rule. So perhaps instead, one of the Br groups is eliminated, forming a carbocation, which then leads to a ring expansion.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, but the product is a carbonyl because of the structure. Wait, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and eliminating HBr twice leads to a ketone via a conjugated diene, which then undergoes a cyclization to form a more stable structure with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone because the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Let me think about the structure: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, might lose two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of a bridgehead carbonyl. So, 1,3-dibromo would lose Br from each position, and the two adjacent carbons would form a carbonyl group, making a diketone? Or perhaps a single ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is 1-adamantanone. Let me think about the structure of 1-adamantanone. It has a ketone at the bridgehead. But wait, the bridgehead carbonyl is possible because the ring isn't strained beyond a certain point. So, perhaps the product is 1-adamantanone.

But then, the NMR spectrum of product 1 would show the expected peaks. Let me think: 1-adamantanone has a carbonyl group. The adjacent CH2 groups would be at around 2.5-3 ppm, but the NMR here shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the product is not a ketone but an alcohol. But the IR at 1720 doesn't support that. If it were an alcohol, the IR would show a broad peak around 3300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. So probably not an alcohol.

Another possibility: the product could be an epoxide, but the IR wouldn't fit. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl-containing compound like an ester or ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters, and I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't show a peak in the 1650 cm⁻¹ region for C=C. The IR given is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it forms an alkoxide, which then eliminates HBr twice, leading to a carbonyl group. Let me think: each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Eliminating both would form a bridgehead carbonyl. So, perhaps it's 1,3-diketone? But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look at the NMR data again. There's a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, perhaps. Integration is 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. But the IR says carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone. The 4.79 ppm peak could be from a CH2 group between the two ketones. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, which would cause it to deshield and appear upfield. Wait, that doesn't fit. Usually, CH2 next to carbonyl is around 2.5-3 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring? Or some sort of ring expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an alkyne, but the IR wouldn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with a substituent. For example, if the structure becomes a bridge with a ketone group, the adjacent CH2 groups might be at 4.79 ppm. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but the IR doesn't suggest that.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not an elimination but a substitution. But with two Br atoms, that would require a double substitution, which would produce a diol, but IR doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should move on for now and come back. Let's look at the next steps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Hmm, aluminum isopropoxide is typically used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, product 1 is treated with a Lewis acid. What's product 1?

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But for that, product 1 would need to be an acyl chloride or an acyl group capable of forming an acylium ion.

Wait, but product 1 is reacted with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe product 1 is an alkyl halide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone that undergoes some kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, which reacts with a Lewis acid to form something else.

Wait, perhaps the first step produces an epoxide? But the IR didn't show that. Or maybe a carbonyl with an adjacent leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the second step. Product 1 is heated with Al(isopropoxide)3. AlCl3 is often used in Friedel-Crafts. So, perhaps product 1 is a benzene ring with a leaving group, and the AlCl3 helps in a substitution. But product 1 is from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a polycyclic structure, not aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, the heating could lead to a rearrangement, or perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl compound which can form an enol under certain conditions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the third step: product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Product 3 is the result of ozonolysis. In ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. The question is about the coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3.

So, to find the coupling pattern, we need to figure out the structure of product 3. Which depends on the structure of product 2, which in turn depends on product 1.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The coupling in product 3 would depend on the substituents adjacent to the carbonyl carbons.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an alkene, which upon ozonolysis forms carbonyl compounds. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show protons adjacent to carbonyls, which are typically deshielded and might have specific coupling patterns.

Wait, perhaps I should try to figure out the structure of each product step by step.

First Step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed. So, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon dehydrohalogenation with KOH forms 1,3-adamantanediol. But that would be a diol, and the IR might not show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate elimination to form a carbonyl. Let me think: each Br is on a bridgehead. Eliminating two HBr would form a carbonyl group. So, structure becomes a bridgehead ketone. So, product 1 is 1-adamantanone.

But then, what's the NMR? For 1-adamantanone, the adjacent CH2 groups would be around 2.5 ppm, but in the given data, 4.79 ppm is for 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the product is not a ketone but an epoxide, but that would have a different IR.

Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretch around 3300.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a double elimination, forming an allene. But that's not possible due to Bredt's rule. So, maybe the elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a new structure with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation and then oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So that might not happen.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a quinone structure. But I'm not certain.

Hmm. Let me look up the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Well, adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on opposite bridgeheads.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent H is abstracted by the base, leading to two eliminations. But again, bridgehead double bonds aren't possible, so maybe the product is a more stable structure with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's consider that the product has a carbonyl group, as suggested by the IR. So, product 1 is a ketone. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which are two equivalent protons. Maybe they're part of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Wait, but the IR says 1720 cm⁻¹, so it's a ketone. So perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a different group. Maybe it's a bridgehead CH2 that's split into a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, another angle: the 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination could form an allene, which is unstable. So, maybe it rearranges into a carbonyl compound. For example, the two adjacent bridgehead carbons each lose Br and form a carbonyl group, leading to a diketone structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridged bicyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1-adamantanol, but that wouldn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. Let me imagine the structure: perhaps a bridgehead with a carbonyl and adjacent CH2 groups. The CH2 groups would be split by neighboring protons.

But I'm not getting it. Let me think about the IR and NMR data again.

IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ → strong carbonyl, likely a ketone.

¹H NMR:

4.79 (2H) → maybe a CH2 next to an oxygen, but in a ketone, probably not. Alternatively, a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 protons are usually around 2.1-2.5 ppm. So 4.79 is higher than that, which suggests more deshielded. Maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR wouldn't show that.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is part of an ester group. Esters have carbonyl groups too, so IR would fit. But product 1 is formed with KOH, which is a strong base, so it's unlikely to form an ester. Unless it's a saponification, but that's usually for esters into carboxylate salts.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to think about the second step. Product 1 is treated with excess Al(isopropoxide)3. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps AlCl3 is used in some kind of Friedel-Crafts, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe AlCl3 is used as a catalyst for some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is an alcohol. Then, when treated with AlCl3, perhaps it forms an acylium ion or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyl bromide, and AlCl3 is used to form an acylium ion for Friedel-Crafts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol. Then, when treated with AlCl3, it could undergo some kind of elimination to form a double bond. Because product 2 is then used in ozonolysis, which requires a double bond.

So, let's think: product 1 is a diol (from hydrolysis of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH). Then, diol is heated with AlCl3. AlCl3 can act as a Lewis acid, perhaps causing dehydration of the diol to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, in the third step, ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene) would form carbonyl compounds in product 3. The NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, this could make sense. Let me outline the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → diol (product 1).

2. Diol + AlCl3 → alkene (product 2 via dehydration).

3. Alkene → ozonolysis → carbonyl compounds (product 3).

But wait, the first step with KOH at 240°C is more likely elimination, not substitution. Because KOH is a strong base and heat favors elimination. So, if product 1 is a diol, that would require substitution, but KOH is more likely to cause elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide? No, because the starting material doesn't have an oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a conjugated diene. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again. If product 1 is a diol, that would require two SN2 reactions, which is unlikely with such a rigid structure as adamantane. So, more likely, product 1 is an alkene or a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone, but I don't know.

Let me think about the first step again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. The reaction is likely to be elimination. Since two bromides are present, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a conjugated diene or a carbonyl.

Wait, but with two Br atoms on bridgehead positions, elimination would form a double bond, but bridgehead double bonds are not allowed. So, the molecule must have some other structure.

Alternatively, maybe the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl group. So, the product is a ketone.

Assuming that, product 1 is a ketone. Then, in the second step, product 1 is treated with AlCl3. AlCl3 is a Lewis acid, and could facilitate Friedel-Crafts acylation if product 1 is a ketone. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is treated with AlCl3 to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some kind of cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyne, but I don't see how.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me
