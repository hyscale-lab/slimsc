Okay, so I've got this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The formula I recall is plx (parallax) equals 1 over distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. That means that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Got it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions. Wait, but when we look in different directions, the volume we're observing varies with distance because space is three-dimensional.

I think the key here is about how volume relates to distance, and thus to parallax. Because when I look at a range of parallaxes, that corresponds to a shell at a certain distance. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. Right, because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and dr is the thickness, so volume is area times thickness.

Wait, but in terms of parallax, since d = 1/plx, maybe I can express everything in terms of plx. Let me see. So d is 1/plx, so d squared is 1/(plx)^2. And dr would be the change in d, which would relate to the change in plx. Let me think, plx is in arcseconds, so plx is 1/d (parsec). So if plx increases, d decreases. So, the volume would be 4π (d)^2 dr. But dr is the change in distance, and I think I need to relate that to a change in plx.

Let's consider a small change in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance changes from d=1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, maybe it's easier to express dr in terms of dplx.

Wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because if d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, the thickness dr (which is dd) is proportional to dplx.

So the volume for a thin shell at distance d (parallax plx) with thickness dr is 4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). Wait, but dr is dd, which is -(1/plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx²) * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ) ). Wait, but the negative just indicates direction, so when considering the magnitude, it's positive. So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, let me double-check. Because dr (the thickness in distance) is proportional to dplx. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx (but negative, but the magnitude is what we're considering). So when you calculate the volume, which is 4π d² dr, substituting d=1/plx and dr= (
