Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.

Alright, the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the concentration given is 0.02 M. But the question is, what's the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution?

Oh, right, the problem gives me the formation constant, K_ca-edta, which is 5x10^10. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and K is the product of their concentrations divided by the reactants.

Wait, no, K is usually Kf, which is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right. So if I have the concentration of the complex, then I can find the concentrations of the individual ions.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So that means [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. Because the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So all the Ca and EDTA is tied up in the complex, right? Or maybe not, because some might dissociate.

Wait, no, the problem states that it's a stoichiometric solution. Hmm, stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex means that the molar ratio is 1:1, right? So when we have 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that would imply that if the complex didn't dissociate at all, the concentration of Ca²+ would be 0.02 M and EDTA would be 0.02 M. But wait, that's not possible because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so it's more stable when complexed.

But the problem says that the pH is ideal, so maybe the EDTA is in its proper form. Wait, EDTA has multiple forms based on pH, but at the ideal pH, I think it's in the Y^4- form. So the formation constant applies.

So the key is to find the concentration of free calcium ions. The complex dissociates as CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this is 1/(Kf) because Kf is for the formation. Oh wait, K for the dissociation would be 1/(Kf). Because Kf is [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]), so Kd (dissociation) is 1/Kf.

So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. That's a really small Kd, meaning the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, the complex concentration will be approximately 0.02 - x, but since Kd is so small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, the expression for Kd would be (x)(x) / (0.02) ) = Kd. Because [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x, and the complex is 0.02.

So the equation is x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Then, x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, but wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 → no, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 * 2 =13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 1e-6.5 → Wait, 1e-6 is 0.000001, 1e-7 is 0.0000001, so 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7.

Wait, wait, 1e-6 = 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7. 6.5 is between 6 and7. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So x is 2 *3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. So approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The Kd is 2e-11, and [complex] is 0.02 M. So x^2 = Kd * 0.02 = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. Square root is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.3e-7. So yes, option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}}
\]

Given \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate from the complex. Since \( K_d \) is very small, the dissociation is minimal, and the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

At equilibrium, \([Ca^{2+}] = [EDTA^{4-}] = x\), and \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\). Substituting these into the equation:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
