Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The compound's IR and NMR data are provided, so I'll need to analyze those to determine the structure of Compound X first.

Let me jot down the given data:

IR:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amine (N-H), but considering the other IR peaks, perhaps something else. Wait, maybe it's an alkyne C-H stretch or an amide. But more likely, since 3400 is where O-H usually appears. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid or an ester. Wait, but the peak at 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl group. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Let's think.

Other IR peaks:
- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong carbonyl peak. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1725, but the O-H stretch would be very broad and strong, around 2500-3300. Wait, but in the IR given, the first peak is 3400–2500, which is a broad region. That might suggest an O-H, like a carboxylic acid (which has a broad, strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300). Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but then the carbonyl would be something else. But let's hold that thought.

- 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1: These are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So, Compound X likely has an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because that's where the -COOH protons appear. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but usually upfield. Wait, but 10.5 is more like a carboxylic acid. Also, the broad signal suggests it's not split into multiple peaks, so no neighboring Hs. In a carboxylic acid, the -OH is usually broad, but in some cases, the -COOH proton might split into a singlet. Hmm, but wait, perhaps it's an aldehyde with no adjacent protons, but I'm more convinced it's a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. So, a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Wait, but how? Let me think: in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is on opposite carbons
