Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

So, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Or is it the ion? So, in the solution, we have different forms of phosphate. The compounds given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that these are related to the different dissociation steps of phosphoric acid.

Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, dissociates in three steps:
1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, the salts provided will contribute to the concentration of these phosphate species. Let's break down each salt.

First, KH2PO4. When it dissociates in water, it should give K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Second, Na2HPO4·2H2O. When it dissociates, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm. So, how does PO4^3- form in solution?

PO4^3- comes from the complete deprotonation of HPO4^2- (the third dissociation step). So, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The Ka3 for this reaction is given as 1.8x10^-12. Since this is a very small Ka, the extent of this reaction is very low, meaning that the concentration of PO4^3- will be quite low compared to HPO4^2-.

But wait, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is probably buffered between the second and third dissociation steps. So, the pH should be in a range where both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, but not much PO4^3-.

But let's think about the actual concentrations. I think I should calculate the initial concentrations of each phosphate species and then use the Ka3 to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

First, I'll compute the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007338 mol.

Wait, let's do exact calculation: 136.09 is approximately 136.09. So 1/136.09 is roughly 0.007338, so 0.007338 mol of KH2PO4. This gives 0.007338 mol of H2PO4^-.

Next, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.
