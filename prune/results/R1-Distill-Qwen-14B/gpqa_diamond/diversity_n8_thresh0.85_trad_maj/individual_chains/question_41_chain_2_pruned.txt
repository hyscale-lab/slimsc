Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see what the question says.

The problem: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction (so, like, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.)

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in it doesn't just add like velocities because of relativity. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, Newtonian mechanics would suggest that velocities add, but I think for light, which is moving at speed c in vacuum regardless of the source's motion, it's different.

Wait, but this is glass, not vacuum. So the index of refraction is n, which is greater than 1. So in the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But here, the glass itself is moving. So does the speed of light in the glass change because the medium is moving?

I'm a bit confused. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n, but when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I think this is a
