Okay, so I've got this question about which organic compounds show optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with the molecules being chiral, right? So they must have a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element.

Let me look at each of the four options one by one. 

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyls can sometimes have stereoisomerism because the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond, allowing rotation. But if there are bulky groups on each ring, maybe it can't rotate, leading to cis and trans isomers. Oh, but wait, do they have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that are symmetric when rotated, then maybe they don't have optical isomers. But if the substituents are not symmetrical, the molecule could be chiral. Let me thinkâ€”6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has two substituents. The positions 2 and 6 are on each phenyl ring. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Like if the substituents are on opposite sides, then perhaps it's not symmetrical. But wait, biphenyls with substituents in positions that don't mirror each other can be chiral. But if the substituents are in such a way that they mirror each other, then the molecule might be achiral. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think if the substituents are on the same side, it might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the presence of nitro groups and ester groups in those positions makes it so that the molecule is chiral. I'm a bit confused here, maybe I should come back to this.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. So the structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the molecule has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Wait, the structure would be:

O
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

So the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to OCH3, OH, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The propanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. Oh wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2COOH. But wait, the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait: the formula for propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would mean the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the structure would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So when it's an ester, it's methyl ester: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The middle carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to what? Let's see: the central carbon has four different groups. The groups are: -OCH3 (from the ester), -OH, CH3 (from the first carbon), and another CH2 group (from the third carbon, which is the COOCH3 part). Wait, no, wait: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- OH
- And the other side is a single bond, so the two substituents on the middle carbon are CH3 and COOCH3, and the other two are OH and H?

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) has:

- a methyl group (CH3) attached to it.
- a hydroxyl group (-OH)
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3)
- and a hydrogen atom (since it's CH, not CH2).

Wait, no, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would actually be:
