Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations yet. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

First, I think I need to figure out what's happening during the titration. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll react in a neutralization reaction. The general reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Wait, but since it's a titration, I need to consider the initial concentrations and volumes before anything else. Let me start by calculating the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution.

The initial volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.020 L, and the concentration is 0.05 M. So moles = Molarity × Volume. That would be 0.05 * 0.020 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

Then, we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ or 0.040 L. This dilutes the acetic acid solution. The new concentration after dilution would be moles divided by total volume. So 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence = 0.001 moles.

Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10.00 cm³. Wait, but the question is about 25% titration, not the equivalence point. Oh, right, wait no, the first part is 25%, and then the equivalence point pH.

Wait, no, the question is asking for two specific points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. So I need to find the pH at each of these points.

Let me tackle the 25% titration first. So at 25% titration, how much NaOH is added? 25% of the equivalence point volume. Since the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Now, I'll calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid, the moles of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- (acetate) will change.

Initially, after dilution, the solution has 0.001 moles of CH3COOH and 0 moles of CH3COO^-.

When 0.00025 moles of NaOH are added, they'll neutralize an equal amount of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^-.

So moles of CH3COOH after reaction = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced = 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total solution volume is the original diluted solution plus the added NaOH. The initial diluted solution is 40 cm³, and we've added 2.5 cm³, making 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, the pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.737 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267=4.733. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = let's compute that. The log of 1.85 is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pKa ≈ 4.733.

So applying Henderson-Hasselbalch.

pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that's around 4.26. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate the ratio accurately. 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3, right? Oh wait, I think I messed up the ratio earlier. Because the concentrations are [A^-]/[HA], which is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) = (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3, and log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet about the equivalence point.

Wait, moving on to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate ions. The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic, and the pH can be found using the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of CH3COOH were 0.001 initially. So moles of CH3COO^- produced will be 0.001 moles.

The total volume at equivalence point is the initial 40 cm³ plus the NaOH added, which was 10 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³, or 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the Kb is small, so we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, but let me confirm.

Let me set up the expression.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x = [OH^-] produced. Then,

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) → assuming x << 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that x is negligible is incorrect. Let's do the exact calculation.

x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is small, but perhaps not negligible. Let's solve for x.

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)
x² = 1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11

= 2.921e-19 + 4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11, since the first term is negligible.

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10) / 2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485 → pH = 14 -5.485 = 8.515, which is approximately 8.52.

Wait, so at the equivalence point, the pH would be about 8.52. But when I calculated earlier using the approximation, I got pH around 9.02, which is way off. So the correct pH is about 8.52.

But wait, that would indicate that option A is correct, which has 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, looking back at the options, let me check.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52
