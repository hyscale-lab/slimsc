Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and there are three reactions happening. I think I need to find out what the initial compound is, then see what each reaction does to it, and finally determine the product.

First, looking at the NMR. The peaks are at 9.72 (triplet, 1H), 6.98 (doublet, 2H), 6.51 (doublet, 2H), 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H), and 3.66 (doublet, 2H). I remember that around 9.7 ppm, that's probably an aldehyde proton. So the triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent hydrogens. Wait, but aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets unless there's something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde? Or perhaps it's next to another structure.

The aromatic region has some doublets. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have 2H. That suggests maybe two para-substituted benzene rings. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent. So two doublets might indicate two aromatic rings each with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but another possibility is that it's a vinyl group next to some substituent.

Looking at 6.27: it's a broad singlet of 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange process, like -OH protons. Oh wait, but those are usually downfield. Or maybe it's a diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with an adjacent group.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Because OCH2 typically appears around 3.5-4 ppm, and as a doublet, maybe adjacent to another CH2 or some other group.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group (from 9.72 ppm), two para-substituted benzene rings (from the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets), an OCH2 group, and maybe a CH2 connected to something else. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Degree of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's compute: For C8H9NO, the general formula is CnHmNO: Degree of unsaturation = (2n +2 - m - x)/2, where x is the number of halogens or something. Wait, but here, O and N are present. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens), then:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Which could be a benzene ring (3 degrees), a double bond (1), and a ring or another double bond. Alternatively, benzene (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (O, but that's 1). Wait, but the aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's one degree. So benzene (3), aldehyde (1), and maybe another double bond elsewhere. Or maybe the O is in an ether or something else.

So, the molecule might have a benzaldehyde part connected to some structure.

Looking at the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 suggests an aldehyde adjacent to two protons. Aldehydes are usually at the end, but if it's a conjugated enal, maybe the aldehyde is at one end and a double bond next. Wait, for example, but-3-enal: CH2=CHCH2CHO. The aldehyde proton would be a triplet because it's adjacent to the CH2 group, but that seems a bit off because the CH2 in between would be on the double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like a dienone or something. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is connected to a vinyl group.

Wait, the 6.27 singlet of 2H could be a vinyl group next to an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2CH2CHO structure? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a diaryl compound, like two benzene rings connected through an aldehyde and some other groups. Let me think about the NMR peaks.

6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) suggests perhaps a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para-d substituted). Each pair is a doublet, so perhaps each benzene ring has a substituent in the para position, and the two substituents are connected in a way that creates coupling. Alternatively, perhaps each is a substituent on a benzene ring, and the coupling is with each other.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like two benzene rings connected through a chain that includes an aldehyde and an ether. Let me think. The OCH2 at 3.66 as a doublet. Maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde connected via an oxygen to another benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an OCH2CH2 group attached. Hmm.

Wait, the 6.27 broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests no splitting, maybe exchange with something. Or maybe it's a diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, but that's not matching the shift.

Wait, another thought: the aldehyde proton is at 9.72 (t, 1H). Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests two neighboring Hs. So, the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. So the structure might be something like RCH2CHO, where R is some group. Or maybe RCH2CHO.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. So, perhaps it's an OCH2CH2 group. So, for example, OCH2CH2... something.

Alternatively, the structure could be a benzaldehyde connected via an oxygen to another benzene ring with some substituents.

Wait, maybe the molecule is 4-(4-hydroxybenzyl)benzaldehyde? Or something like that. Or perhaps it's 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Wait, but the NMR data includes a triplet at 9.72, which could be the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO?

No, but that would have the O in the middle. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's an OCH2 group, and the OCH2 is connected to another benzene ring. So, something like Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the integral is 1H for the triplet at 9.72. So that's the aldehyde H. The 3.66 is two Hs, so maybe that's a CH2 connected to O. For example, the aldehyde is at one end, then a CH2-O, then another CH2, and then connected to a benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO?

But that would make the O in the middle. Let's think about the NMR.

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO: The aldehyde H would be at ~9.7, as a triplet because next to CH2. The OCH2 would be a quartet because next to another CH2. But in the given data, the OCH2 is a doublet. So maybe it's Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO? But that would mean the O is connecting the two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would make the OCH2 adjacent to another CH2, so it would be a quartet. Hmm, so that doesn't match the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would have the aldehyde H as a triplet, but the CH2 would be next to the aldehyde. So maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but that would have the aldehyde as a triplet, but the CH2 would be a quartet or triplet.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring connected via a CH2-O-CH2-CHO group. Hmm, but then the O would be an ether, so the structure would be Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO. But in that case, the OCH2 would be next to another CH2, so it would be a quartet. But the NMR shows a doublet for the 3.66 ppm. Hmm, perhaps the O is not between two CH2 groups. Maybe it's OCH2 connected to something else.

Wait, another approach: the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets. Let's think of two benzene rings, each with substituents. Each doublet is 2H, so maybe each ring has a substituent at the para position.

So, maybe the structure is something like 4-(4-substituted benzyl)benzaldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (4-hydroxyphenyl)propenal or something similar. Wait, but that would have a conjugated system.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 could be the aldehyde, and the doublet of 3.66 (OCH2) suggests maybe a CH2 connected to oxygen and another group.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible reactions. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's a typical nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization, especially of aromatic amines. So, if the initial compound has an aromatic amine, it would form a diazonium salt. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO, which doesn't have NH2. Wait, but maybe it's an O-amino group? Or perhaps an -NH-O- group.

Wait, another thought: the initial compound might have a hydroxyl group, which under certain conditions can be converted. But the first step is NaNO2 and HCl, which is usually for aromatic amines.

Wait, maybe the initial compound has an -NH2 group. But in the NMR data, I don't see a peak that would correspond to NH2. Unless it's deprotonated or in a different environment. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound has a secondary amine or some other group. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, the formula is C8H9NO. The molecular weight would be 8*12 +9 +14 +16 = 128 +9= 137 +14=151 +16= 167? Not sure, but the important part is the functional groups.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with a nitro group or an amine. Wait, but the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which are used for diazotization. So perhaps the initial compound has an aromatic amine, like an aniline derivative.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Aniline is C6H5NH2 (mol formula C7H7N). Our compound is C8H9NO, so it's bigger. Maybe the substituent is something like OCH2CH2CHO. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is 4-(4-hydroxybenzyl)benzaldehyde. Let me see: benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a 4-hydroxybenzyl group would make it C8H8O2. But our formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps it's 4-(4-hydroxybenzyl)benzaldehyde with a NH2 somewhere. Or maybe another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group attached. For example, 4-aminophenyl group attached to a benzaldehyde via a CH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. But that's C7H5NO. Our formula is C8H9NO. So maybe it's a bigger substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an amine. Like 4-(something with NH) group.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows an OCH2 group, so perhaps the molecule has an OCH2CH2CHO structure. So, something like OCH2CH2CHO attached to a benzene ring. For example, benzene-O-CH2CH2CHO.

But wait, the formula would
