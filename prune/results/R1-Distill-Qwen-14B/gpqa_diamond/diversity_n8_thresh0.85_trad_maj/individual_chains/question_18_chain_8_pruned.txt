Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But maybe the masses aren't directly relevant here, unless it's about their lifetimes or something else, but considering the question is about elemental abundance ratios, I think the masses might be a red herring or perhaps not needed for this particular calculation.

The question gives me some elemental abundance ratios determined using the EW method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). Let's list out the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh right, the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. The brackets usually denote the logarithm of the ratio of element X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Alternatively, sometimes in the literature, it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun, depending on the context. But here, the question gives [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], which are ratios of elements to each other, not to hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The notation [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y in the star compared to the ratio in the Sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.

But wait, the question is asking about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, the ratio [Si/Star_1] compared to [Si/Star_2], or perhaps the ratio of [Si in Star_1] to [Si in Star_2]?

Wait, the question says: "Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be (n_Si in Star_1) / (n_Si in Star_2). Hmm, no, wait, actually, if it's the ratio of silicon atoms, it's n_Si1 / n_Si2. But wait, perhaps I should consider how each star's silicon abundance is determined relative to other elements, and then compare them.

Let me think about how to proceed. The problem gives [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and [Mg/Si] for Star_2, as well as their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], which are both zero for each respective star. Hmm. Let's break it down.

First, let's process the Sun's data. The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait,
