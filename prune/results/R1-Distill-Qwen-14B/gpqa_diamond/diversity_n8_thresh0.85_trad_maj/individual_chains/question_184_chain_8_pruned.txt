Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are given as 2, 1, and 3 respectively. Wait, numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let me sketch it out.

So, the benzene ring has six positions. Let's number them clockwise starting from the ethoxy group. Oh wait, the compound is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the substituents are adjacent in a meta arrangement? Or wait, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, making them all meta? No, wait, position 1 is next to 2 and 6, and 3 is next to 2 and 4. So substituents are at 1, 2, 3, which are adjacent. Hmm, but wait, that would make the nitro and ethoxy groups adjacent? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents in terms of their positions relative to each other. The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Their positions are 1,2,3 respectively. So when I draw the benzene ring, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in adjacent positions, but wait, does that make sense? Because benzene is a ring, perhaps it's more about the relative positions than the absolute numbering.

Alternatively, maybe it's a meta arrangement. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the directing effects of each substituent and the order in which they are introduced.

So, directing effects: Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and the tert-butyl group is a bulky, strong para director because it's an alkyl group (but wait, tert-butyl is
