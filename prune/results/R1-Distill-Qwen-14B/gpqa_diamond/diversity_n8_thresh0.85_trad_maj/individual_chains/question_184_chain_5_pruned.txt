Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. Let me take it step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw its structure mentally. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position numbering: let's say position 1 is the ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 is the tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 is the nitro group (NO2).

Wait, actually, I think I should number the positions correctly. Let me imagine the benzene ring. If the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that would make them adjacent. Oh wait, no, that's not possible without some being meta. Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the numbering starts with ethoxy at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, meaning they are adjacent in a row. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positionsâ€”so that would mean each is adjacent to the others. Wait, but that's only possible if the substituents are in a row, but benzene is a ring, so that would require all three substituents to be on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So positions 1,2,3 are adjacent. So the nitro group is at position 3, which is next to position 2 (t-Bu) and position 4, which is ethoxy's position? Wait, no, that can't be. Maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, but in a way that they are adjacent. So, the substituents would be at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro), making a para arrangement for some of them, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the synthesis steps.

I remember that when substituting benzene, the order of reactions matters because each substitution can direct the next. So, for example, nitration is a meta director, ethoxylation (ether) is an activating group, and t-butyl is a bulky group which is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so I need to plan the order of adding these groups so that each step is directed correctly.

Let me think, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). Alternatively, wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe position 1 is where the ethoxy is attached, then moving around the ring, the next position is 2 with t-Bu, and then 3 with nitro. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, meaning they're all adjacent.

Wait, but wait, how can three substituents be adjacent on a benzene ring? Because in a benzene ring, each position is connected to two others. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, forming a trio of adjacent substituents.

But that's a bit unusual, but possible.

So, to synthesize this, I need to introduce the three substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects each group has on the next substitution.

First, let's think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (-OEt): This is an activating group, ortho/para-directing. So when introducing a new group after this, it would go ortho or para to the ethoxy.

2. tert-Butyl group: Also an activating, ortho/para-directing group, but it's a bulky group, so it will favor ortho positions when possible, but sometimes para might be the major product depending on steric factors.

3. Nitro group: A deactivating, meta-directing group. Once introduced, it will direct incoming groups to meta positions relative to itself.

So the problem is to introduce these three groups in the correct sequence so that each new group is added in the desired position.

Let me consider the possible order of addition.

One approach is to add the substituents in an order that allows each substitution to direct the next correctly.

Let me outline possible sequences.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but after ethoxy, adding tert-butyl would be directed to ortho or para. Suppose I add ethoxy, then tert-butyl at ortho. Then, when I add nitro, it would be directed to meta with respect to the nitro group. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should plan each step.

Let me consider each possible order.

One approach is to add the nitro group last because nitro is a meta director, which might complicate the positions of the existing substituents.

Wait, but let's see.

Suppose I start with benzene.

Step 1: Introduce the ethoxy group. So, benzene + ethoxylation. That's typically done via an etherification reaction, like using ethyl bromide with a catalyst like AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation? Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for alkyl groups. Wait, no, wait: Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups, but for ethers, perhaps we use something else. Maybe Williamson ether synthesis? Or perhaps it's just using SO3 as a sulfonating agent and then substituting it with ethoxide?

Wait, no, benzene can't be directly alkylated via Friedel-Crafts for ethers. Wait, no, perhaps using a tosylate or something else.

Wait, another approach: To introduce an ethoxy group, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I think that's more involved. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group. Alternatively, maybe I should think about using nitration first, but since nitro is deactivating, that might not be helpful unless I want to add activating groups later.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of substitution is: add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Or maybe add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or add nitro first, but that might complicate the other substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the tert-butyl group first, then the ethoxy, then the nitro group. Let me think.

Wait, if I first add tert-butyl (t-Bu), which is an activating, ortho/para director. Then, add ethoxy. But ethoxy is also activating, ortho/para. So where would the ethoxy go relative to the t-Bu group?

It could go ortho or para to the t-Bu.

Wait, but since the target has the ethoxy at position 1 and t-Bu at position 2, they are adjacent. So, perhaps after adding t-Bu, the
