Okay, so I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Oh wait, Grubbs is specifically a ring-closing metathesis catalyst, but it can also do other types, like cross metathesis or ring-opening.

Let me think about the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. The formula is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it properly. Pentene is five carbons. 1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm wait, wait, no. Wait pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no, let me count again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would mean a methyl group is attached to the third carbon in the chain. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's five carb
