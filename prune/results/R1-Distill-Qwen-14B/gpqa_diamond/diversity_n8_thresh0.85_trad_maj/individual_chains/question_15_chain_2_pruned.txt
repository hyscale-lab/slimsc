Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits, and I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's distance from us. Wait, no, actually, the probability is more about the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But in this case, maybe the key factors are the orbital period and the size of the star.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same masses, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has three times shorter a period than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and P2 is 3*P1? Or wait, no, the question states that Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Oh, right, so if Planet_2's period is, say, 300 days, then Planet_1's is 100 days. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Also, the host stars have the same radii. Wait, even though the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But same radius. Hmm. So the stars have same size but different masses. For stars, higher mass usually means larger radius, but if they have same radius, perhaps they're main sequence stars with a bit different masses but similar sizes. Not sure if that matters yet.

The key thing for transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but I might be mixing it up. Let me think. The transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 times the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on to our line of sight.

Wait, the formula I remember is: the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt{e})) ), but since both orbits are circular, eccentricity e is zero, so that term is 1. So the probability simplifies to R_star/(a) times some function of the impact parameter. Wait, but the actual probability of a transit (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front) is
