Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. Let's list out what's given.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. So maybe A is something that reacts in an 8:1 ratio with B.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, maybe D is another gas, and it's reacting in a 2:1 ratio with C.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrated, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is like HCl and G is like H2SO3 or something. But wait, not sure yet.

Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B combine 1:1 to make H, a solvent. Common solvents could be things like HCl (but that would require HCl as a product, but D is a gas. Wait, D is a gas reacting with B to form a solvent. Maybe H is something like H2O? No, because H2O isn't a gas. Or maybe H is something like ethanol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is another compound like NH3, but that's a gas too. Hmm.

Let me think about possible compounds. Let's see, for Reaction 4, D and B combine 1:1 to form H. If B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, maybe D is something else. Wait, another thoughtâ€”maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. So when they react in a 1:1 ratio, they might form HCl. But HCl is a gas, so that can't be because H is used as a solvent. Wait, maybe H is NH3? No, because then B would be N2 and D would be H2, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is H2O, but H2O is a liquid at room temperature
