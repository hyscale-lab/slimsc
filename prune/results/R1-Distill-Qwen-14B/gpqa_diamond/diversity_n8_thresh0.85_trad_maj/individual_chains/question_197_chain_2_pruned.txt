Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what it forms when reacted with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D.

First, I need to analyze the spectral data given. Let's start with the IR. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's no N mentioned here, O-H is more likely, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then, a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Common in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but if there's an O-H, a carboxylic acid might make sense because they have both O-H (broad) and C=O (around 1700). Also, the peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 probably corresponds to aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the molecule has an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a high chemical shift. A broad singlet. Could be an O-H proton, like in a carboxylic acid. But sometimes aldehydic protons are around 9-10, but those are usually more deshielded and might be a triplet or something else. But this is a broad singlet, which fits O-H. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The 8.0 ppm is more deshielded, and 7.2 is less. So perhaps the substituent is electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl group, causing the para protons to be downfield. Wait, but wait, if it's a benzene with substituents, like two substituents in para positions? Or maybe one substituent in para. Wait, let me think. If the substituent is at para position, the two protons adjacent to it (ortho) would be more deshielded, but if it's a single substituent, the ortho and para protons would have different shifts. Hmm, maybe the substituent is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two substituents, each causing the neighboring protons to shift.

Wait, but if the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H, that suggests that there are two pairs of protons. Like a para-substituted benzene with two substituents opposite each other. So maybe the ring has two substituents in the para positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that would complicate the splitting more.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and there's another substituent else where. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, which would cause the adjacent protons (ortho) to be deshielded. So for example, in benzoic acid, the ortho protons are downfield shifted. Let's think: in benzoic acid, the protons ortho to the COOH group are around 8.0-8.3 ppm as doublets, and the meta protons are around 7.5-7.8. So in the given NMR, we have two doublets. One at 8.0 (2H) and another at 7.2 (2H). So perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a COOH or a ketone.

But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1725, so that fits. Also, the O-H would fit the 10.5 ppm peak. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet integrating for one proton. It could be a methylene (CH) group adjacent to an oxygen or something else. Or maybe part of an isopropyl group? Wait, the next peak is 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), that's two protons, perhaps as a CH2 group. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons, perhaps a CH(CH3)2 group? Wait, no, a triplet with 3H is a CH3 which is split into a doublet, but wait, that's not matching. Wait, wait
