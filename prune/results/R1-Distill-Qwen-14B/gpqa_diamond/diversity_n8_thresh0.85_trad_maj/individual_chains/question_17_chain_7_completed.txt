Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

Okay, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us how stable that complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So, knowing that, I think the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.

Wait, the complex is stochiometric, which I think means it's in a 1:1 ratio. So the formula might be CaY^2- where Y is EDTA. So, Ca²+ plus EDTA^4- forms the complex, right.

The formation constant, K, is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K given is 5e10, which is a large number, so the complex is pretty stable.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, if the complex dissociates a little, the [Ca²+] would be low because the complex is stable.

I think I should use the formula for the dissociation of the complex. The formation constant K is given, so the dissociation should be Kd = 1/K. Because K is the formation constant, so the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have a K of 1/K.

So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

The dissociation reaction is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. 

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, assuming that initially, all the EDTA and Ca are in the complex. But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so that's our initial concentration.

Let me set up the ICE table.

Initially:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

Change:
[CaEDTA^2-] decreases by x
[Ca²+] increases by x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is very small, x is tiny)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the expression for Kd would be:

Kd = ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) / [CaEDTA^2-] ]

Plugging in the values:

2e-11 = (x * x) / 0.02

So, x² = 2e-11 * 0.02
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let's compute that.

4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So x would be 2e-6.5 M.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6 -0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5. 10^-0.5 is about 0.316. So 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me recheck the steps. The Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Yeah, correct. And the setup of the ICE table is correct. The assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 M is valid because Kd is so small. So x is about 6.3e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), so the dissociation constant \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we assume that the dissociation is small due to the very small \( K_d \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{(since \( x \) is negligible)},
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}.
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.02}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} = 10^{-6} \cdot 10^{-0.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
