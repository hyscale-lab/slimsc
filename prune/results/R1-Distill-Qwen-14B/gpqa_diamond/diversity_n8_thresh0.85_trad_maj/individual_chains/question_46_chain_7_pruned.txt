Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually involves the redistribution of alkene fragments.

Let me start by drawing the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But here it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure should be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the position. Carbon 1 is CH2, carbon 2 is CH, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), carbon 4 is CH2, and carbon 5 is CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons.

Wait, pentene is five carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C3 (the third carbon) is a methyl group. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Wait, but wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's six carbons. No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the methyl group is on C3. So the structure becomes CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, that's six carbons. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, no
