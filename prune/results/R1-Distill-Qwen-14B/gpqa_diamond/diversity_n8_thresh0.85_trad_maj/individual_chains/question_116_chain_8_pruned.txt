Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and NMR spectra. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the initial compound is A. Its proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others. The 0.9 ppm area is usually for methyl groups attached to something like CH2 or maybe a CH in a cyclohexane ring. Six hydrogens in a triplet—could that be two methyl groups each attached to a CH2, because 2 CH3 groups would give 6 H. And each CH3 is next to a CH2, so each CH3 proton would see the two neighboring Hs in the CH2, giving a triplet. 

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet suggests each of these protons is adjacent to three others. 4H might be two sets of CH2 groups. Wait, maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. For example, in a cyclohexane ring, if there's a 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, but wait, the NMR would show different patterns. Or perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2- group. If the quartet is for 4 H, that could be two CH2 groups each attached to another CH2. Maybe like a 1,3-diamethylcyclopentane? Or wait, let's think about the splitting. If a CH2 is next to another CH2, each proton in the first CH2 would split into a quartet because it's next to three (two CH2 protons on each adjacent group?) Wait, no, each CH2 group has two protons. So if one CH2 is next to another CH2, each of the four protons would split into a quartet? Or maybe it's a geminal situation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet comes from a CH2 that's next to two CH3 groups. Wait, no, that might give a triplet. Wait, for splitting, the number of neighboring Hs determines the splitting. So for a triplet, each H is next to two Hs. Quartet—each H is next to three Hs. So a quartet means the proton is adjacent to a group with three Hs. So, for example, a CH2 next to a CH3 (which has three Hs), but wait, each CH2 proton would see the three Hs from the CH3, so each would split into a quartet. Or perhaps the quartet comes from a CH next to a CH2. Wait, no, a CH would have more complex splitting.

Wait, let's think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H: that's two CH3 groups. Each CH3 is next to a CH2 because the triplet suggests each CH3 proton is seeing two neighboring Hs. So maybe the structure is something like two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2 group. But then where do the quartet 4H come in? Oh, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons. Let me imagine cyclohexane with two CH3 groups on adjacent carbons. But then each CH2 would be next to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where two adjacent carbons each have a methyl group. So like 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons. Then, the neighboring carbons (the ones next to the methyl) are CH2 groups. So each methyl group's protons would be adjacent to two Hs from the CH2. That would make each CH3 a triplet, and the total 6H from two CH3 groups. Then, the CH2 groups next to the methyl would each have two Hs. So each of their protons would see the two adjacent CH3 groups. Wait, no, each CH2 is between two other CH2 groups. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 1,3-dimethylcyclopentane. Let's see: a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 3. Each methyl would be adjacent to a CH2. The protons on the methyl would each have two neighboring Hs, so triplet. That fits the 6H as two CH3 groups. Then, the CH2 groups between them would each be adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but then their protons would be next to two Hs each. So each would be a triplet. But the NMR shows a quartet for 4H. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: The quartet (4H) would be each in a group that's next to a CH
