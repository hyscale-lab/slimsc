Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass is attached to a spring and experiences a restoring force proportional to the displacement. But wait, this is relativistic, so we have to consider special relativity effects, which probably means using the relativistic expressions for momentum and energy.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy of a spring is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy (1/2)mv² would equal that. Solving for v would give v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But this is a relativistic scenario, so it's not that straightforward.

In relativity, energy and momentum are related differently. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the momentum p is gamma mv. But how do these come into play for a harmonic oscillator?

Hmm, I think in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energy expressions change. The total energy would have contributions from both the spring's potential and the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy conservation. At maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. But in the
