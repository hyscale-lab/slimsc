Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still learning all these reactions and NMR interpretations.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. When heated with excess KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, so heating dibromoadamantane with KOH would lead to the formation of a double bond. Since the bromines are on adjacent carbons in an adamantane structure, eliminating both would form an allene (cumulative diene) or maybe a single double bond if it's a different structure. Hmm, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the positions of the bromines would determine where the double bond forms.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so maybe there's an ester or a ketone group formed. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, elimination could form a carbonyl via oxidation? Or perhaps the reaction isn't just elimination.

Wait, wait. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diegeminal dibromide, no? Wait, no, diegeminal would be same carbon. 1,3 would be on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. But where's the carbonyl coming from?

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't just elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing an elimination that results in a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement? Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that when the two Br atoms are eliminated, a ketone is formed. Hmm.

Wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is typical for a carbonyl, maybe a ketone. So product 1 has a ketone group. So perhaps the reaction is not just elimination but maybe a ring expansion or some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the elimination of both Br atoms, and in the process, forming a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If I have 1,3-dibromoadamantane and treat it with KOH, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. But that would make an alkene, not a carbonyl. Unless the structure is such that elimination leads to a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR of product 1 is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a doublet (2H) probably an OCH2 group, maybe an ether or an ester. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but 4.79 is upfield for a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Maybe it's an epoxide? No, the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, maybe it's part of a cyclic structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR peak at 1720. Hmm.

Wait, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 might be an ester or a ketone. Since the starting material is a dihalide, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but with KOH... Hmm, but KOH is a base, so maybe elimination is more likely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, producing an alkene, but then oxidation occurs. Oh, wait, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the elimination, but the structure leads to the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH isn't just acting as a base. Wait, if the reaction is with KOH and heat, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but then the base could deprotonate something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enolate. But that's more about the next step, maybe.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but earlier I thought that didn't fit. The IR would show an epoxide around 1250 cm⁻¹, but the given IR is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a conjugated diene, but then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings, right? So the 1 and 3 positions are two adjacent bridgehead carbons. So when those two Br atoms are eliminated, perhaps the structure becomes a bicyclic compound with a double bond. But then, how does that produce a carbonyl group?

Wait, maybe during elimination, a ring opens or a new ring forms, creating a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of a carbonyl group via some kind of conjugate elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would require two carbonyls. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the elimination of HBr twice from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would produce an alkene. But then, how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the base is causing the formation of an epoxide, but that's not matching the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. But if KOH is present, substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the product isn't from a direct reaction of the dihalide with KOH. Maybe there's another step. Wait, no, the first step is heating with KOH, so it's a single step.

Wait, let me think about the N
