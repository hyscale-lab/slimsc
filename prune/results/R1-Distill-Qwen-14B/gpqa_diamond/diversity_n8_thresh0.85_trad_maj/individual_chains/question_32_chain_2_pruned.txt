Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I've heard a bit about colliders and relativistic speeds before, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations. So, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy; it's more than that because of the kinetic energy involved.

The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium typically has 3 protons. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it a 6 nucleon nucleus. Wait, wait. Oh wait, protons and neutrons are called nucleons. So, Li-6 is a nucleus with 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6.

I think the next step is to find the rest mass of this nucleus. But wait, for heavy ions like this, their rest mass is significant compared to electrons, so I can't just ignore it. So I'll need the mass of Li-6.

But wait, how do I find the rest mass energy of Li-6? Hmm, I think the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately known. Let me recall that the atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.66e-27 kg. So, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². Wait, yes, I've heard that 1 u is about 931 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy is mass (in u) multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u. But wait, the energy units here are GeV, so I'll have to convert MeV to GeV by dividing by 1e3.

Wait, but another thing comes to mind. The rest mass energy for a nucleus is given by E_rest = m * c². So if I can find m, the mass of the nucleus in kg, I can find E_rest. Alternatively, using the atomic mass in u and then converting to GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for relativistic energy. The total energy E is gamma times the rest energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So, given that v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma first. Let me calculate that step.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2. Let me compute that: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then, sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, no, let me calculate sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Hmm, square root of 0.0784. Let me think: 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m c².

So I need to find m, the rest mass of Li-6. Hmm, but I don't have the exact value, but maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for a nucleus with mass number A, the approximate mass is A times the mass of a nucleon. A nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², but wait, that's about 0.938 GeV/c². So for Li-6, A=6, so m = 6 * 0.938 GeV/c²? Wait, no, wait, that's not exactly correct. Because the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than A times the mass of individual nucleons due to binding energy (mass deficit). But since we're dealing with the rest mass energy, perhaps we can approximate it as m = 6 * m_p (mass of proton). Wait, but Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so perhaps it's better to compute it as m = (3 m_p + 3 m_n) / c².

Wait, but the exact mass might require looking up the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon (like an average) multiplied by the number of nucleons. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the mass as a given value, but the question says 'Li with 3 neutrons', which is Li-6. The standard atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). So m = 6.015 u.

So converting that to kg: 6.015 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈ let's compute that. 6 * 1.6605e-27 is about 9.963e-27 kg. 0.015 u is 0.015 *1.6605e-27 = 2.49075e-28 kg
