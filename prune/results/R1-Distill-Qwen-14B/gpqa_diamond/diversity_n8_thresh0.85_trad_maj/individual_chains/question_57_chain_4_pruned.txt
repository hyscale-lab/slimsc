Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through what I remember from my studies.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So I guess I only consider these five.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that the scattering amplitude has real and imaginary parts, and for electrons (or any particles), these are related to the phase shifts.

Wait, I think the general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the amplitude is expressed as a sum of terms involving Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. But wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0°. So maybe I can find a formula that gives me the imaginary part at θ=0 specifically.

I recall that the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(θ) = ∑ [ (1/(2i)) * ( (l + 1) P_{l} (cosθ) e^{2iδ_l} - l P_{l}^{−1}(cosθ) e^{2iδ_l} ) ) ] for each l. Or maybe it's the other way around, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is given by the sum of sin(δ_l) multiplied by some factors.

Wait, I think another approach. The scattering amplitude is often written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * ∑ [ ( (l + 1) P_l (cosθ) e^{2iδ_l} ) - ( l P_{l}^{-1} (cosθ) e^{2iδ_l} ) ) ], where k is the wave number. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the imaginary part of the amplitude is (1/(2k)) * sum [ (l + 1) sin(2δ_l) ] at θ=0? Because when θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1 for all l. So the Legendre polynomials evaluate to 1, right?

Wait, but wait, when θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1) is 1. So each term in the sum would simplify. Let me think again.

The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( l + 1 ) P_l (cosθ) e^{2iδ_l} - l P_l^{-1} (cosθ) e^{2iδ_l} ) ]

Wait, or is it with a different factor? Maybe I should think about the real and imaginary parts. Alternatively, I remember that the imaginary part of f(θ) is given by the sum over l of ( (l + 1) sin(2δ_l) + l sin(2δ_l) ) ) multiplied by some terms, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude f can be written as f = f_real + i f_imag. At θ=0, perhaps this simplifies. Let me think about the partial wave expansion. The imaginary part of f at θ=0 would be the sum over l of ( (l + 1) sin(2δ_l) ) / (2k) ?

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula that directly gives the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0. Oh right, I remember that at θ=0, the expression simplifies because P_l(1)=1. So when θ=0, the amplitude becomes:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (l+1) e^{2i δ_l} -
