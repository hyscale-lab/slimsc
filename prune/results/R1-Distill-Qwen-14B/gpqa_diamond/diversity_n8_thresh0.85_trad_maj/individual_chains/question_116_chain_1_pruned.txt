Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet (which is two neighboring H's) and a quartet (three neighboring H's) might indicate some kind of alkyl groups. Also, the chemical shifts: 0.9 is probably methyl groups attached to something, maybe a CH2 or CH. The 1.3 ppm is a bit downfield for a CH2, but maybe it's next to something else.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That suggests two sets of three H each, each as a triplet. Or maybe it's a single set of 6H as a triplet. But wait, 6H is like two CH3 groups, each with 3H. So maybe two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon or adjacent carbons.

And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. 4H could be two sets of 2H each. Or maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Wait, quartet would mean each of those 4H is split by neighboring protons. So maybe a structure where each CH2 is next to another CH2. Like maybe a propyl group? Or perhaps a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, putting it together: 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet. I think this is a classic case for a diethyl group. Because in diethyl groups, each CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the CH3 (since the adjacent CH2 has two H's), and the CH2 would be a quartet. Let me think: for an ethyl group, the CH3 is a triplet because the adjacent CH2 has two H's. But wait, if there are two ethyl groups, perhaps the splitting would be different. Or maybe it's like a neopentyl group? No, neopentyl is more like a central CH2 with two CH2CH3 groups attached.

Wait, another approach: maybe it's a diethyl ether? Because diethyl ether has CH2CH3 groups. But if A is diethyl ether, then the protons on the CH2 would be next to each other. Let me think about the splitting. The CH3 groups in diethyl ether would be adjacent to the CH2, so the CH3 would be a triplet (because the CH2 has two H's). Similarly, the CH2 would be a quartet (since each is next to two CH3 groups, which each have three H's? Wait no, the CH2 is next to another CH2, which has two H's. So each CH2 would have a quartet. But if there are two ethyl groups, maybe the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe compound A is cyclohexane with some substituents. Wait, but the NMR signals don't seem to match that. Or perhaps A is a diethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, another thought: if the 6H are triplet, maybe they're two methyl groups each as a triplet. So perhaps two CH2CH3 groups. Diethyl ether would have two CH2CH3 groups. So for diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet (coupled with CH2's two H), and the CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with CH3's three H). Oh, but wait, in diethyl ether, the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, so each CH2 would actually be a quartet. Wait, but if you have two ethyl groups, each CH3 would be a triplet because each is next to a CH2 with two H.

But wait, the NMR given is two signals: triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H. So perhaps each CH3 is a triplet (6H in total, two CH3 each triplet), and the CH2 is a quartet (each with 2H, two CH2 groups so 4H in total).

Wait, so if it's diethyl ether, the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So each CH3 is a triplet because they're next to a CH2. Each CH2 is a quartet because they're next to CH3. So the CH3 would be triplet (each has 3H), and the CH2 would be quartet (each has 2H). So the NMR would show two triplets? No, wait, in diethyl ether, each CH3 is a triplet and each CH2 is a quartet. But the number of H's would be 6H (two CH3 groups) and 4H (two CH2 groups). So yes, the NMR would have a triplet at around 1.
