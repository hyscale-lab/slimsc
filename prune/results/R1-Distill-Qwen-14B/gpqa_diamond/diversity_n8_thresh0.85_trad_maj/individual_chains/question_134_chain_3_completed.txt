Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Typically, it's around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this might depend on the specific reaction.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other.

Wait, but wait a second. H2SO4 is diprotic, meaning it can donate two protons. So each molecule can react with two hydroxide ions. But wait, the problem is about enthalpy of neutralization. The standard value is per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

Let me think about the moles of each component. I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. The neutralization will depend on which is in excess.

So, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. The volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L, and the concentration is 0.2 M. So moles HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Second, H2SO4. It's a strong acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, concentration 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Since each gives 2 H+, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base; each mole gives 2 OH-. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L, concentration 0.5 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so OH- is 0.2 mol.

Wait, but wait. So the H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. That means all OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. The enthalpy per mole of H+ reacting is about -57 kJ/mol, but wait, I should check if it's per mole of H+ or per mole of acid. Oh, right, since the standard is per mole of H+.

So the moles reacting are 0.2 mol of OH-. So the heat released is 0.2 mol * (57 kJ/mol) = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait, because the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is exothermic, so the value should be negative. So -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, units are different. Because I calculated in kJ, but the options are in kcal.

Ah, right! So I need to convert kJ to kcal. Because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ divided by 4.184 is roughly 2.726 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.726 kcal, which is approximately -2.73 kcal. Wait, but that's not matching my previous thought.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I got confused. Let me clarify:

If 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH- to produce 1 mole of water, releasing 57 kJ (or about 13.66 kcal, since 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.66). Oh wait, wait, 57 kJ is about 13.66 kcal. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me compute that: 57,000 J is 57 kJ. To convert J to kcal, since 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 57,000 J / 4184 ≈ 13.66 kcal. So per mole, it's about -13.66 kcal.

But wait, that can't be right because the options only go down to about -16 kcal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the standard value wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use 57 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, but the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard value is usually 57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), as in the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O(l), ΔH ≈ -57 kJ/mol.

So, in this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But the options have B as -11.42 kcal and D as -16.0 kJ. Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. If I convert that to kcal, it's 11,400 / 4184 ≈ 2.726 kcal, so -2.73 kcal. Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. Oh, that's very close.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2 mol. So only 0.2 mol of H+ will react.

So, moles of H+ reacting: 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → 11.4,000 J. To convert to kcal: 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. Since the reaction is exothermic, it's -2.726 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. So that would be if we considered 0.28 mol of H+ reacting, but that can't be because the OH- is only 0.2 mol. So, only 0.2 mol reacts, so option A is the correct one.

Wait, but why is option D -16.0 kJ? 16 kJ is more than the 11.4 I calculated. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stoichiometry of the reactions between the specific acids and the base. Wait, for Ba(OH)2, each mole gives two OH- ions. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+. So maybe the reaction would involve both H+ from H2SO4 and HCl reacting.

But when mixing, the H+ comes from both acids. The OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol. So all OH- will react, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So the reaction's enthalpy is based on 0.2 mol H+ reacting. So 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ → which is 11.4 kJ, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization in terms of equivalents. Wait, wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, another approach: calculate the equivalents of acid and base.

Equivalents = normality × volume (L).

HCl is monoprotic, so normality = molarity = 0.2 N. Volume 0.5 L → equivalents = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so normality = 2 × molarity = 2 * 0.3 = 0.6 N. Volume 0.3 L → equivalents = 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2 is diprotic (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-), so normality is 2 × molarity = 2 * 0.5 = 1.0 N. Volume 0.2 L → equivalents = 1.0 * 0.2 = 0.2 eq.

So total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Base equivalents: 0.2 eq.

So the acid is in excess by 0.08 eq. So the neutralization is 0.2 eq, which is the limiting reagent.

So the heat released is 0.2 eq × 57 kJ/eq = 11.4 kJ. Wait, but that's the same as before.

So again, 11.4 kJ is the heat. Converting to kcal: 11,400 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.726 kcal. So the answer would be approximately -2.73 kcal, which matches option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? Oh wait, wait, perhaps the question is asking for kJ, but option B is in kcal. Let me see.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. 11,400 / 4184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. So that's approximately -2.73 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

Another possibility: maybe the standard enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. So each mole of H2O gives off 57 kJ. So in this case, 0.2 moles of H2O would be formed. So 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ, same result.

So, the answer is -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that as a choice. Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's more than 11.4 kJ. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the stoichiometry between the specific acids and the base.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when you mix H2SO4 (diprotic) and Ba(OH)2, they can react in a 1:1 molar ratio, because each provides two equivalents.

So H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, perhaps the neutralization between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is more involved. Because H2SO4 has two H+ per molecule, and Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per molecule.

So each mole of H2SO4 can neutralize two moles of Ba(OH)2? Or wait, the stoichiometry is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 1:1.

So let's see:

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol.

So, for the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which is 1:1, 0.09 mol H2SO4 can react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.1 -0.09= 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 unreacted.

Wait, but wait. Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol, H2SO4 is 0.09 mol. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent in this reaction. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O, releasing 0.09 * 57 kJ = 5.13 kJ.

Wait, but the Ba(OH)2 that remains is 0.01 mol, which provides 0.02 mol OH-.

Then, the HCl is 0.1 mol H+.

So the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.02 mol. H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

So, 0.02 mol OH- will react with 0.02 mol H+ (from HCl), producing 0.02 mol H2O, releasing 0.02 *57 = 1.14 kJ.

So total enthalpy is 5.13 + 1.14 = 6.27 kJ. Wait, that's 6.27 kJ, which is about 1.5 kcal (6270 J /4184 ≈ 1.5 kcal). But that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, this approach might be incorrect.

I think I made a mistake here because when all the solutions are mixed, all the H+ from both acids and OH- from the base will react together, not sequentially.

Let me think again. The total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol.

So, 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+ (since OH- is the limiting reagent), producing 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ, which is 11,400 J or about 2.726 kcal.

So the correct answer is -2.726 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal).

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So option A is the correct choice.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids and the moles of OH⁻ from the base.

1. **Moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \) (1 H⁺ per molecule).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \) (2 H⁺ per molecule).
   - Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \) (2 OH⁻ per molecule).
   - Total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Limiting reagent:**
   - H⁺ = 0.28 mol, OH⁻ = 0.2 mol. OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 mol of H⁺ reacts with 0.2 mol of OH⁻.

4. **Enthalpy of neutralization:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for 1 mol of H⁺ is approximately \(-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}\).
   - Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times 57 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \), so \( 11.4 \, \text{kJ} = \frac{11.4}{4.184} \approx 2.726 \, \text{kcal} \).
   - Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy is \(-2.726 \, \text{kcal}\).

6. **Match with options:**
   - Option A is \(-2.72 \, \text{kcal}\), which is closest to the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
