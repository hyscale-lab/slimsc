Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The question asks which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I remember correctly, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning there's a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. These chiral centers lead to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. So, each of these compounds needs to be checked for the presence of such centers.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Starting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. It's a biphenyl with two methyl groups attached as esters on the 2 positions of each ring. Also, there are nitro groups on the 6 positions of each ring. Wait, do the substituents create any chiral centers? The central biphenyl structure—each phenyl ring is connected at the 1' position. So, the substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. Since the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is in the biphenyl structure, it's actually a single carbon connecting both rings. Wait, no, the biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So, each ring's carbons are connected through a single bond. So, the substituents on each ring are symmetric? Wait, in this case, each ring has a COOCH3 group at the 2 position and a nitro group at 6. Wait, 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So, is there a possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that are mirror images, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents on each ring are the same, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for free rotation, making any potential stereoisomerism impossible. Wait, but in biphenyls, sometimes the single bond can lead to restricted rotation if the substituents are bulky, but I'm not sure here. Alternatively, maybe the substituents create a chiral center on the central carbon. Wait, no, the central carbon is part of the biphenyl, which is a single bond, so it's not a carbon that's bonded to four groups. Each ring has carbons, but the position where the rings are connected is a single carbon (like each ring is attached at one carbon to the other). So, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups (from each ring) and maybe other substituents? No, wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So, the central carbon is part of both rings and isn't a chiral center. Therefore, I don't think this compound has any chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism here. Hmm, but wait—could the substituents on each ring cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry? For example, each ring has identical substituents, so maybe the whole molecule is symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. So, option 1 doesn't exhibit it.

Moving on to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw the structure. Propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, with the OH on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. So, the methyl ester
