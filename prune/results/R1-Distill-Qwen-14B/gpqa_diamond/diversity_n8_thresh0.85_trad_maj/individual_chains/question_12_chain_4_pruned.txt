Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values.

Wait, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Right, because when the pion decays, it's at rest, so the total momentum should be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, so its rest energy is also 139.6 MeV. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, but the neutrino is nearly massless, so I think its rest energy is negligible. Wait, but neutrinos do have some mass, but in most problems, they approximate it as zero unless stated otherwise. So I'll go with that assumption here.

So, the total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's energy (which includes its rest energy and kinetic energy) and the neutrino's energy (which is all kinetic because its rest mass is zero).

Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. Then:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). But maybe I don't need to get into that. Alternatively, since the pion is at rest, I can use conservation of four-momentum.

The four-momentum squared is invariant. So, for the pion, the four-momentum is (E, 0) where E = m_pi c^2. After decay, the four-momentum is the sum of the four-momenta of the muon and
