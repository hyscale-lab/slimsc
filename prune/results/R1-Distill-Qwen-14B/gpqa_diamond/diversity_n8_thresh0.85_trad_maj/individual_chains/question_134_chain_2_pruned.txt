Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Their volumes and concentrations are provided. I remember that neutralization reactions are acid-base reactions where H+ ions from the acid react with OH- ions from the base to form water. The enthalpy change for this process is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but I need to check the options to see the units.

Wait, looking at the options, I see some are in kcal and others in kJ. Oh right, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules, but sometimes people use approximate values. Maybe the question expects me to use a certain heat of neutralization value.

I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is around -57 kJ/mol. But wait, why? Because when an acid donates H+ and a base donates OH-, they form water, which releases heat. So the reaction is exothermic, hence negative.

But wait, each acid and base may contribute differently. Also, I have to consider the stoichiometry of each reaction.

Let me list out the given data:

1. HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
2. H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
3. Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

Hmm, HCl is a strong acid and donates one H+ per molecule. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but I think for strong acids like H2SO4, both protons are donated. Wait, actually, I think the first H+ is completely ionized, but the second might not be as strong. Wait no, H2SO4 is considered a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second H+ isn't as strong. Or wait, sometimes it's treated as completely ionized depending on concentration. Hmm, but for the purpose of neutralization, I think we can assume that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions.

But wait, when these solutions are mixed, the H+ from acids will react with OH- ions from the base. The total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. The total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

Let me calculate the moles of each H+ and OH-.

First, find moles for each solution:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is 1:1, it contributes 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ = 0
