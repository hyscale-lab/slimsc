Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's think. I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula is d = 1/plx, where d is distance in parsecs and plx is the parallax in arcseconds. So higher parallax means closer stars, right?

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Oh, but wait, when considering parallax, how does that translate?

I think I should consider the volume of space at a certain distance. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So as plx increases (meaning closer), the distance decreases. But how does the number of stars in a thin shell (like a small range of plx) depend on plx?

Wait, volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr. Since r is distance, which is 1/plx. So let me write that down. r = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Oh, because if plx increases, r decreases. Hmm, but when considering a small change in plx, dplx, the corresponding change in r is dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with the volume, which is positive, maybe I should take the absolute value.

So the volume of a thin shell at radius r is 4π r² dr. Substituting r as 1/plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is ( -1/plx² ) dplx. Wait, but the volume can't be negative. So maybe it's 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx? Because dr is proportional to dplx as 1/plx². So dr = (dplx) * (1/plx²) [taking absolute value]. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The volume element for a shell is 4π r² dr. Since r is 1/plx, dr is the change in r, which is (change in 1/plx) → derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx is -1/plx². So dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. But the change in r is negative because as plx increases, r decreases. So the volume is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx ). But since we're considering the absolute volume, the negative sign doesn't matter. So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for a given dplx (a small change in plx), the number of stars is proportional to the volume, which is 1/plx^
