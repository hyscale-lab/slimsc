Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows some specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. So, what reaction occurs when dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH?

I think KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's causing an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps an E2 mechanism occurs, eliminating HBr twice. Wait, but wait, elimination reactions usually form alkenes. So if you eliminate two HBr molecules, you would form a diene or maybe a triple bond? But considering the structure of adamantane, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (-C=O). That doesn't fit with an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps it's an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement. Or maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, when you heat a dihalide with a strong base like KOH, you can get a substitution. But substitution would give a diol, right? But the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch. Wait, but the IR here is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: elimination to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait! Could it be a Fittig reaction or something else? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some cyclization?

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH would likely undergo elimination. Since both Br atoms are on adjacent carbons (in a diamond structure), maybe eliminating HBr from each would form a triple bond. Oh wait, but in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So, the 1 and 3 positions are across from each other? Maybe. So when you eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps it forms a bridge or a ring with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene. Let me think, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → when heated with KOH, maybe it loses two equivalents of HBr to form an alkene.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong peak for a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an alkene but a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the structure rearranges. Wait, another possibility: the base could cause an elimination to form a ketone via a retro-aldol like mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination? But Hofmann is more about amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination to form an alkane with a triple bond? No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH may result in an E2 elimination, where each Br leaves along with a β hydrogen, forming a double bond. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two E2 steps, each eliminating HBr, forming a diene or maybe a more substituted double bond.

But if the product has a carbonyl group, maybe the structure undergoes some kind of oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an alkyne.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond. So two HBr eliminations would form a triple bond between the two carbons where the Br was attached. That would make sense, as the product would then have a triple bond. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a triple bond (which is usually around 2100 cm⁻¹). Oh wait, the IR here is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the NMR and IR. Let me look at the NMR. The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a -CH₂- group adjacent to an electronegative atom or maybe an oxygen. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another CH₂ group. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) is a bunch of CH₂ groups in a more shielded environment.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's an adamantyl ketone. But how would that form? Maybe via elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide, which doesn't fit the scenario here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form an epoxide? No, epoxide would have different NMR and IR features.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dielimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diketone. But that would require two eliminations, each forming a carbonyl.

Wait, considering the IR, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which is typical for a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe the base is causing a double elimination, but the structure rearranges to form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial product is an alkene, but then it undergoes some oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, so that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base is causing a coupling reaction. For example, the Fittig reaction where two aryl halides react in presence of Na to form a biaryl. But in this case, the starting material is adamantane, which isn't aromatic. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzil-type elimination. Benzil is an example where two adjacent ketones undergo elimination to form a diketone. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an adamantane with a ketone group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane could lose two HBr molecules to form a ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe each elimination forms a carbonyl. Let me think, each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group? No, that would need O in the product, but KOH provides the hydroxide. Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes a diketone, but that seems unlikely without an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a conjugate elimination. Wait, but I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about the NMR of product 1. The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests maybe a CH₂ group coupled with two adjacent protons. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH₂ group that's perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a ring. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) might be CH₂ groups in the adamantane structure.

Wait, if elimination occurs, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantadiene? But that's just an alkene, which wouldn't explain the IR peak at 1720.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the KOH is acting as a base for a ring-opening. But adamantane is a very stable structure; it's unlikely to open under KOH.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that product 1 is a diol, but that wouldn't fit the IR peak at 1720. Diols would show broad O-H stretches around 3300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned, so probably not.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720. That's a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So product 1 must have a ketone or an ester or something similar. But the starting material is a dihalide, and KOH is a base. So perhaps it's a substitution to form an ether, but that would require two alkoxy groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination followed by a rearrangement that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbene or some other intermediate that then forms a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form an alkyne. So two dehydrohalogenations would form a triple bond. The IR for a triple bond is around 2100, but the given IR is 1720, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But again, the IR doesn't fit, and the NMR doesn't suggest anything like that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone, if that's the case. So if product 1 is a ketone, then maybe product 2 is an acylated version.

But wait, in Friedel-Crafts acylation, you need an aromatic ring. But product 1 isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is a diol or something else after some reaction with aluminum isopropoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide is a high-temperature alkylation or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkyne, and product 2 is a diene after some reaction. But I'm not getting any clarity here.

Moving on, product 2 is ozonolysed at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms carbonyl compounds.

So, the initial product 1 must have a structure that upon reaction with aluminum isopropoxide forms a diene, which then undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece this together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

If product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's 1,3-adamantanedione. But how? From a dihalide, maybe via elimination of two HBr, each forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each bromide leaves, and the base abstracts a hydrogen, causing the formation of a carbonyl. So each Br in 1,3 positions is replaced by a ketone. But wait, that would require each elimination to form a carbonyl group. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedione.

But wait, that would mean two ketone groups in the structure. The IR would show a strong peak around 1720, which matches. The NMR would show the ketone carbonyl as a singlet, but the given NMR doesn't mention that. Wait, the NMR doesn't show a peak in the carbonyl region (like around 9-10 ppm for a ketone proton), but wait, product 1's NMR doesn't have any peaks in that region. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a single ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the two bromides are eliminated in a way that forms a single carbonyl group. For example, if the elimination leads to the formation of a bridge, creating a ring with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, which then undergoes some kind of oxidation to form a ketone. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

I'm a bit stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a glycol (diol) after hydrolysis. But that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another angle: looking at the NMR of product 1. The triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H suggests a -CH₂-O- group, perhaps an ether. Because CH₂ next to an oxygen tends to show up around 4 ppm. A triplet would mean that the CH₂ is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which has two protons. So maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen.

Wait, so 4.79 ppm (2H, triplet) could be CH₂-O-CH₂-. But then what? The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be another CH₂ group adjacent to something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. For example, if two bromines were on adjacent carbons and elimination formed an epoxide, but the NMR doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Since KOH is present, the Br could be replaced by an O- group, but with two Br atoms, that would form a di-alkoxide, which would then protonate to form a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretch, so perhaps it's not a diol.

Wait, maybe the product is an ether. For example, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and KOH causes a coupling reaction, forming an ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but that requires an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Maybe the base deprotonates something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, given that the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require two ketone groups, which would have peaks in the NMR around 2.1 ppm (for the CH₂ adjacent to ketones), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) in product 1's NMR: 10 hydrogens suggests five CH₂ groups. In adamantane, each ring has six CH groups, but in the structure, perhaps some are equivalent. So maybe that's the remaining structure of the adamantane.

The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an ether. But how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. So each Br leaves, and the adjacent C-O bonds form. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Wait, another thought: perhaps KOH induces a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group via a radical mechanism. But that's probably too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form an alkene, but then the alkene undergoes some oxidation. But again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene. Then, when product 1 is reacted with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of addition or reaction to form a dienol or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a diol after some acid-catalyzed hydration. But then ozonolysis would cleave the diene into carbonyl compounds.

Hmm. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's think about the ozonolysis step.

Product 2 is ozonolysed, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically forms carbonyl groups. So if product 3 is formed by ozonolysis, product 2 must have had a double bond.

So, product 2 has a double bond, which comes from product 1 after reaction with aluminum isopropoxide.

So, product 1 → (heated with Al(OR)3) → product 2 (has a double bond).

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. It's often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an acylated product. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is an epoxide or some other structure.

Wait, but product 2 is then ozonolysed. So product 2 must have a double bond. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something that can form a double bond upon reaction with Al isopropoxide.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diene. Then, product 2 could be a substituted diene or something else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and the reaction with Al isopropoxide is a hydride abstraction, leading to a carbocation, which then rearranges? Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the reaction with Al isopropoxide dehydrates it to form a diene. That would make sense. If product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al isopropoxide (a dehydrating agent) would cause elimination to form a diene (product 2), which then undergoes ozonolysis.

So, let me retrace:

1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH → product 1, which is a diol. Then, product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, which dehydrates the diol to form a diene (product 2). Ozonolysis of product 2 (the diene) would cleave into carbonyl compounds.

But wait, would the diol form a diene upon dehydration? That depends on the structure. Let me think, if product 1 is a vicinal diol (like 1,2-diol), then dehydration would form an alkene. But if the diol is in a 1,3 position, perhaps two dehydrations would form a conjugated diene.

Wait, but 1,3-diol would require two eliminations to form a conjugated diene.

So, let's say product 1 is a 1,3-diol. Heating with Al isopropoxide (a dehydrating agent) would cause two eliminations, each removing an H2O, to form a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis of the diene would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would be a diketone or possibly two carbonyl compounds.

But let's get back to product 1. If product 1 is a diol, then the IR would have O-H stretches, but the question says the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. So that doesn't fit, unless the diol is further oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 isn't a diol. Maybe I'm wrong about that.

Another approach: the IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which strongly suggests a carbonyl group. So product 1 must be a carbonyl compound.

So, product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound. Then, reacting with Al isopropoxide forms product 2, which has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or an enolate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another reaction involving ketones and Al isopropoxide: maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation. But that typically forms a new carbon-carbon bond and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes an elimination to form an enone (a conjugated ketone with a double bond).

Wait, but how would that happen? For example, if product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, perhaps the Al isopropoxide abstracts a β-hydrogen, causing elimination of water and forming a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl.

So, product 2 would then be an enone (conjugated ketone). Then, ozonolysis of the double bond would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But ozonolysis of an enone would cleave the double bond, but where?

Enone structure: R₂C=CR-C=O

Ozonolysis would break the double bond, and each fragment would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but enones are conjugated, so ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls.

So, product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds. But the question is about the NMR of product 3, particularly the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeable ones).

Wait, but in the ozonolysis step, when you have a conjugated diene, ozonolysis gives different products. Wait no, in the case of an enone (conjugated double bond and ketone), ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, more accurately, when ozonolysis is performed on a conjugated enone, it might not cleave the same way. Wait, maybe I should think about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is isolated, not conjugated. So ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but let's think about the product after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But product 3 is formed after ozonolysis with dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive work-up, so any ozonides would be cleaved into aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution.

But back to the initial steps. Product 1 is a ketone, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide forms product 2, which is a diene (or some structure with a double bond). Then, ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about product 3's NMR. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (not exchangeable). The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Deshielded protons are usually in electronegative environments, like next to oxygen or in a double bond. In product 3, after ozonolysis, if it's a carbonyl compound, any adjacent protons would be deshielded.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a diene would produce carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 was a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. So product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a 1,4-diene (conjugated), ozonolysis would give different products.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or dialdehyde. Let's suppose product 3 is a dialdehyde. The protons adjacent to the aldehyde group would be deshielded. In the NMR, those protons would show up around 9-10 ppm, but the question says to exclude exchangeable protons, so perhaps those are not the ones in question.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, another angle: If product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would open it into a chain with two carbonyl groups.

But perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a triplet or some splitting due to neighboring protons.

Wait, if product 3 is a diketone, perhaps the structure is such that the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are each coupled to two equivalent protons, leading to a triplet. Alternatively, maybe they are next to two different sets of protons, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure has a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, the protons on the CH₂ would be split by neighboring groups.

Wait, let me think about a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a 1,3-diene, and ozonolysis cleaves each double bond, giving two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of a single double bond would cleave it into two carbonyls. So if product 2 is a single double bond, product 3 would have two carbonyls.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece it together again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (light yellow, IR 1720). Probably a ketone.

Product 1 → Al isopropoxide → product 2 (maybe an enone or diene).

Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3. Product 3's NMR: the most deshielded proton's coupling.

If product 3 is an aldehyde, the adjacent protons would be deshielded. But aldehyde protons are usually sharp singlets and may be exchangeable, so the question excludes them.

Alternatively, if product 3 is a ketone, the adjacent protons would be in a CH₂ group. For example, a ketone with a CH₂ next to it.

Wait, let's say product 3 is a ketone with a CH₂ group adjacent. The CH₂ protons would be split based on neighboring groups.

If the CH₂ is next to another CH₂ group, each proton in the CH₂ would be split into a triplet. Because each H in the CH₂ is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH₂. So the triplet would be the coupling pattern.

Wait, but that would be a triplet, which is option A. But the options include more complex splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the CH₂ is next to a CH group which has two Hs, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, which is adjacent to a CH group. So the first CH₂ is next to a CH₂ (giving a triplet) and also next to another group that splits it further.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the CH is next to a CH₂, then each proton on the CH would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, in a ketone, the adjacent CH group would have protons that are deshielded. For example, in acetone, the CH3 groups are next to the carbonyl. But those protons are split based on neighboring groups.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the adjacent CH has two neighboring CH groups, each with two protons. So the coupling would be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about splitting patterns.

If a proton is adjacent to two different sets of equivalent protons, it can result in a doublet of triplets. For example, if each H is split by two neighboring groups, each with two Hs.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a CH₂ group and another CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that is adjacent to a CH₂ group and another CH group. So each H in the CH would be split by the two Hs in the adjacent CH₂, giving a triplet, and also by another H in the adjacent CH. Wait, no, because the CH would have only one H.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each H is adjacent to two different types of Hs. For example, coupling with two different sets of adjacent Hs, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a -CH₂-CH₂- group next to a carbonyl. The Hs in the first CH₂ would be split by the two Hs in the second CH₂, leading to a triplet.

But if the structure is more complex, perhaps the Hs are next to two different types of Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, the most likely splitting pattern for a CH group adjacent to a CH₂ and another CH (each with two Hs) would be a triplet of triplets, as each coupling would split into triplets.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets if there are two different coupling constants.

Alternatively, considering that each H is coupled with two Hs from one group and two from another, but that's not typical. Usually, each coupling is to a single set of equivalent Hs.

Wait, another approach: think of the splitting as a result of two different coupling partners. For example, if a proton is split by two neighboring sets of Hs, each with J1 and J2. The splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not one of the options. Or a triplet of triplets if each split is into three.

Wait, but the options include a triplet of triplets (option B) and a doublet of triplets (option C). So perhaps the proton is coupled to two different sets, each causing a triplet split.

Hmm. If a proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group (two Hs, triplet split) and also adjacent to another CH group with two Hs (another triplet split), the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, leading to 3 x 3 =9 peaks, but that's a lot. But perhaps in reality, it's a triplet of triplets, but that's option B.

Alternatively, if the proton is in a -CH-CH₂-CH- structure, each adjacent CH₂ would cause a triplet split, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that each H is next to a CH₂ group and another CH group, each providing two Hs for coupling. That would lead to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets if there's another coupling.

Wait, another possibility: the most deshielded H is part of a CH group next to a CH₂ group and another CH₂ group on the other side. Each adjacent CH₂ would split the H into a triplet, resulting in a triplet of triplets. So that would be option B.

Alternatively, if only one adjacent CH₂, it would be a triplet. So why would it be more than a triplet?

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is a triplet of triplets, so option B. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, option C.

Wait, perhaps another way: if the H is coupled with two different sets of two Hs each, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. Wait, no, each coupling would split into doublets. Each coupling would split into a doublet, but if two couplings are present, it would be a doublet of doublets.

Alternatively, maybe each coupling has a different J value, leading to a more complex pattern.

I'm not entirely confident, but based on the options, I'll go with the triplet of triplets as the coupling pattern.


The problem involves analyzing a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C produces product 1, a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a carbonyl group and CH₂ groups. This points to product 1 being a ketone, likely 1,3-adamantanedione, formed via double dehydrohalogenation.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, to form product 2. This step likely involves dehydration or rearrangement, leading to a structure containing a double bond. Product 2 is inferred to be an enone (a conjugated ketone with a double bond).

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl compounds. Thus, product 3 is a diketone or contains carbonyl groups.

4. **NMR analysis of product 3**:  
   The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding exchangeable protons. The most deshielded protons are likely adjacent to carbonyl groups. If these protons are part of a CH group flanked by CH₂ groups, the coupling pattern would involve interactions with protons on adjacent CH₂ groups. Each CH₂ group would split the signal into a triplet, and if there are two such interactions, the overall splitting pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
