Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again: "Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?" The options are A to D, with numbers 4, 8, 6, 2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds, right? Specifically, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, often used in ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, as well as cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, but since it's a double bond, maybe it's about the geometry? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-eneâ€”let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, wait, wait. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be a CH(CH3) somewhere. Let me think: 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, wait. No, the formula is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3) something? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on the third carbon. Let's number from the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C3 is the next one: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2 something. Wait, wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3) but that would be longer. No, perhaps I should draw it as:

The molecule is pent-1-ene, so five carbons with the double bond starting at carbon 1. So carbon 1 is double bonded to carbon 2. Then, the substituents on carbon 3 would be a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because that would be six carbons. Wait, no. Wait, let me try again.

Wait, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is CH, connected to a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? But wait, that can't be right because that would be six carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH2CH2CH3, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of the structure as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, maybe 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's five carbons in total. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be six carbons. Hmm, I'm getting a
