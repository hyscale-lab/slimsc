Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of plx, its distance d is 1/plx parsecs. Right, so plx = 1/d.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, we're looking for N, the number of stars, as a function of plx. And the distribution is uniform in the sky, which I think implies that the number density of stars is uniform. Wait, but how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

I think I need to consider the volume of space at a certain distance that corresponds to a small range in parallax. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume would be proportional to that volume. So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Also, dr would relate to d plx. Let me think. Let me express everything in terms of plx.

Let me start by expressing the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. So, the distance d is 1/plx. The volume of a thin shell at d is 4πd² dr. But I need to express this in terms of dplx.

Wait, plx is 1/d, so when d changes by dr, plx changes by dplx. Let me relate dr to dplx. Starting with d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, so dr = -dplx / plx².

But when considering a small interval, the negative sign just indicates direction, but for the magnitude, we can take the absolute value. So, dr is approximately dplx / plx².

Wait, so the change in distance dr is equal to dplx / plx². No, wait, because taking the derivative: dr = (dd/dplx) * dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd/dplx is -1/plx². So, dr = -dplx / plx².

But when calculating the volume, we can ignore the negative sign because we're dealing with magnitudes. So, the volume element (the thin shell) is 4πd² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = (dplx)/(plx²), we get:

Volume element = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx)/(plx^2) ) = 4π (1 / plx²) * (dplx) / plx² = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, that's 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number
