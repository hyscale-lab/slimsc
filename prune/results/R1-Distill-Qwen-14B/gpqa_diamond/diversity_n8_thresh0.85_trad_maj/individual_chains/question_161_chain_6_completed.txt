Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopy and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

So, the scenario is about Mike designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is under 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because there's less scattering. But even with that, some gas molecules remain, and the mean free path is λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right?

So when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is why this happens. The options are about the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

Wait, the question says that the temperature remained the same. So temperature hasn't changed. So why would the mean free path change?

Mean free path (λ) is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density of the gas, and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * n), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the scenario, the pressure is under 10^-9 Torr, which is a very low pressure. So n, the number of molecules per unit volume, is low, which would make λ large. But when the electron beam is turned on, maybe something else happens.

Oh, wait! The electron beam emits electrons. Those electrons could cause gas molecules to ionize or perhaps even get knocked off the walls or other parts of the chamber. Wait, but if the vacuum is already very high, maybe that's not the issue. Alternatively, the electron beam itself could interact with the gas molecules, causing more scattering than before.

Wait, but the mean free path is about how far a gas molecule travels before it collides with another molecule, right? Or maybe it's about the mean free path of the electrons as they pass through the gas? Oh wait, wait, the initial situation is about the gas's mean free path being λ1. When the electron beam is on, maybe the electrons are interacting more with the gas, causing the gas molecules to move or change their distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes some heating? But the question says the temperature remained the same, so that's not it. Hmm.

Wait a second, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are high-energy. They can cause gas molecules to be excited or perhaps they knock gas molecules into the beam path. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas to ionize, creating charged particles that are more likely to be affected by the electric fields in the microscope, leading to more scattering.

Wait, but wait, the mean free path λ is determined by the gas's properties. If the gas is ionized, perhaps the collision cross-section changes. Or maybe the number density of the gas increases because the electrons are somehow causing more gas particles to be in the beam path.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to a different effective pressure because the electrons are interacting with the gas. Or it could be that the electron beam creates more scattering centers, effectively increasing the number of collisions the gas molecules undergo.

Wait, but Mike determined λ1 based on the initial vacuum state. But then, when the electron beam is on, the mean free path changes to λ2. So why would λ2 be different?

Another angle: the mean free path of the electrons in the vacuum is different. Oh! Because the gas molecules cause scattering of electrons. But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, no. The question says, upon initiating the electron beam, he noticed the mean free path was λ2. So perhaps it's the mean free path of the gas molecules that's changing.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas depends on the number of gas molecules and their collision cross-section. If the electron beam somehow causes the gas to expand or change the number density, that would affect λ. But the pressure is the same, so number density n is the same, right? Because pressure is proportional to n. Unless the beam is somehow causing gas to be pumped out more, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the electron beam's components, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam's energy is causing the gas to heat up. Wait, the question says the temperature remained the same, so that can't be it.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are about λ2 relative to λ1.

Option C says λ2 is less than λ1. So would the mean free path decrease when the electron beam is on? That would imply more collisions among gas molecules, which would require higher number density or higher collision cross-sections. But if the number density is the same, then a higher collision cross-section would result in a lower mean free path.

Wait, but why would the collision cross-section change? If the gas molecules are ionized, their effective cross-section might change. Or perhaps the electron beam causes gas to be excited, making the molecules larger in some sense, so their effective cross-section increases.

Wait, if the collision cross-section σ increases, then λ = 1/(√2 * n σ) would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But why would the collision cross-section increase?

If the gas is in the presence of high-energy electrons, the gas molecules might become ionized. When they're ionized, they have electric charges, which could increase their effective cross-sectional area for collisions. So the cross-section σ might increase. So n is the same, but σ is higher, leading to a lower mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by the electrons, causing them to move or dislodge, but that seems more like a pumping effect, which might actually lower the pressure, but the question states that the pressure (hence n) remains the same.

Wait, but the problem says that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path is now λ2. So it's not the same as λ1. So what changes?

Wait another thought: the mean free path of the electrons might be λ2, but the question states that the gas molecules' mean free path is changing. Wait, the question says Mike found that 'the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2.' Oh, wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules would be λ1 before, but when the electron beam is on, perhaps the mean free path of the electrons is changing. But the question says, he observed it based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the original λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules, but when the electron beam is on, the mean free path of the electrons is λ2. Because the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules more, their mean free path decreases. So the electrons' λ is λ2.

But the question says Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1. Then, upon initiating the beam, he observed that the mean free path was λ2. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the setup: Mike accurately determined the mean free path of the gas molecules in the vacuum state to be λ1. But upon initiating the electron beam, he found that the mean free path was now λ2. So the gas molecules' mean free path is now λ2.

Wait, why would the mean free path of the gas change? Because the electron beam affects the gas in some way. Maybe the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be ionized, which affects their collision cross-section.

Wait, when a gas molecule is ionized, it has a charge, so when other molecules collide with it, the cross-section increases because the ion might have a larger effective size or because the charges cause more interaction. So the collision cross-section σ increases, which reduces λ.

So if σ increases, λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C: λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile or in a different state, which affects the mean free path.

Another possibility: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being heated by the electrons, but the question says the temperature remains the same. So that can't be it.

Wait another angle: the mean free path of the electrons is being discussed, not the gas. But the question states that Mike determined the gas's mean free path as λ1. But when the beam is on, the electrons are scattered by the gas, so their mean free path is λ2. So perhaps the question is about the electrons' mean free path. Oh, but the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says, "minimizing the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy." So the gas molecules cause electron scattering, which is a problem. So when Mike starts the beam, he's observing the electron scattering, which depends on the number of gas molecules and their mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas is λ1 when the beam is off. When the beam is on, perhaps the electrons cause the gas to ionize, which changes the electron mean free path. Or perhaps the gas's own mean free path is not changing, but the electron scattering is.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the formula again.

The mean free path λ for gas molecules is given by λ = 1/(n σ √2), where n is the number density, and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another common formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d^2 n), where d is the molecular diameter.

If the pressure is the same, then n is the same. But factors like temperature and σ would change λ.

The question states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So T is same. So if σ increases, λ decreases.

So if the presence of the electron beam causes σ to increase, then λ2 would be less than λ1.

Why would σ increase? Because the gas molecules are ionized, leading to higher cross-sections.

So the answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.


The question involves understanding the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope when the electron beam is initiated. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path of the gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum state to be λ1. However, upon turning on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

The mean free path of gas molecules is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} n \sigma}
\]

where \(n\) is the number density of the gas molecules, and \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section. The pressure in the sample compartment remains constant, so \(n\) does not change. The temperature is also constant, as stated in the problem. Therefore, any change in \(\lambda\) must be due to a change in \(\sigma\).

When the electron beam is initiated, the high-energy electrons can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective collision cross-section (\(\sigma\)) because charged particles interact more strongly with each other. This increase in \(\sigma\) reduces the mean free path of the gas molecules, leading to \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\).

Thus, the correct conclusion is that the mean free path decreases when the electron beam is on, making λ2 less than λ1.
