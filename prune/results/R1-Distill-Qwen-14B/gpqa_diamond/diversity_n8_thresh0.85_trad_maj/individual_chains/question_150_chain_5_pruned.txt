Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves an NMR analysis and some reactions leading to a product. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, that breaks down into 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me think about possible structures. The NMR data might give me some clues about the structure.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm usually indicates an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. But wait, the triplet—what would cause that splitting? Maybe adjacent to a CH2 group with two protons. Because a triplet in that region with 1H suggests coupling with two neighboring protons.

Then, 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. 6.51 ppm is another doublet of 2H. These could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two protons on each ring, each as a doublet. So maybe two benzene rings, each with substituents in the para positions. But wait, the coupling between aromatic protons—what's that about? If the substituents are para on each ring, the aromatic protons would be as doublets, perhaps.

Next, 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet might be something like an enol proton or maybe some conjugated diene. But in the context of possible reactions, maybe it's an enol? Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

Then, 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably something like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Or maybe a methylene group adjacent to an aldehyde or another group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has two benzene rings connected via some chain. Let's think about the possible connectivity.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene rings are C6H5, so if there are two benzene rings, that's 12 carbons, but we only have 8. Oh, wait, but maybe one ring is substituted. No, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound. So maybe the structure is something like diphenyl connected via a three-carbon chain, perhaps. Let's think: two phenyl groups attached to a butenyl or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's a coumarin derivative or something else. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR has an aldehyde (9.72 ppm), a triplet. So the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't fit the formula. Let me count.

Ph group is C6H5. If I have two phenyl groups, that's 12 carbons, but the molecular formula is C8. Oh wait, perhaps it's not two benzene rings. Maybe one benzene ring and another group.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Wait, another thought: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Degrees of unsaturation can be calculated. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, two benzene rings (each has 3 DoU, but two would be 6 DoU) but that's more than 5. So maybe one ring plus some double bonds. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps one benzene ring (3 DoU), an aldehyde (which is a double bond, 1 DoU), and a ketone or another double bond. Or maybe an aromatic ring and a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring and a cyclic structure. Hmm.

Looking back at the NMR data: The triplet at 9.72 suggests an aldehyde next to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but that only gives a formula of C7H7O, which doesn't match. Wait, the given formula is C8H9NO. So maybe there's another substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure has two benzene rings but not both connected directly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diphenylamine derivative or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let me think about the NMR again. 

The aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps two substituents on a benzene ring, each in the para position. Wait, no, because each doublet would be for a pair of protons. Wait, if you have a substituent that causes the ring protons to split into a doublet, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, another possibility: The structure might be a di-substituted benzene ring, with substituents that each have their own protons. For example, if there's a substituent with two protons, like a CH2 group attached to the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a coumarin derivative, which consists of a benzene ring fused to a pyrone ring. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let me think about the reactions involved. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. Aqueous KOH, heat.

So first, nitrous acid is formed. Then, water, and then KOH and heat. This sounds like a possible diazotization followed by hydrolysis.

Wait, typically, when you have a benzyl amine, you can do diazotization with NaNO2 and HCl (acid conditions), then maybe a substitution reaction or hydrolysis.

But wait, the initial compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. So maybe it's an aromatic amine? Or perhaps an aniline derivative.

Wait, the O in the formula could be from a hydroxyl group, but also possibly from a carbonyl. But the NMR shows an aldehyde, so maybe O is from something else. Alternatively, perhaps the O is part of a ketone, but I don't see a peak that would indicate a ketone (usually around 2 ppm as a singlet for a carbonyl, but I don't see that here).

Wait, the NMR data shows 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet for 2H. That could be a pair of protons adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an enol, which would have exchange broadening. Or maybe it's a diene, but the broadness suggests maybe an acidic proton like an enol.

Wait, perhaps the structure has two phenyl groups connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde and some oxygen. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The aldehyde is at one end, so maybe something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. But that would be C9H10O, which doesn't match the formula. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. If we have a benzene ring (6 carbons), then two more carbons elsewhere. But then, perhaps the structure has a side chain with two carbons.

Alternatively, maybe a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Let me think: If the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, that's 8 carbons (Ph is 6, then two more in the chain and the aldehyde). Wait, no, Ph is C6H5, then CH2CHO is two carbons (CH2-CHO is two). So total C8? Let me see: 6 (Ph) + 2 (CH2 and CHO) = 8. Yeah, that fits. So the formula would be C8H7O, but our formula is C8H9NO. Oh wait, we have an additional N and O. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO. But then the formula would include an OH, which is O, and an N? Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a secondary amine attached to a benzene ring, along with an aldehyde group. Let's think about that.

Wait, another approach: The reaction steps. First, NaNO2 and HCl is a diazotization reaction. So if the starting compound has an amine group, it would form a diazonium salt. Then, H2O, perhaps hydrolysis. Then, KOH and heat, which could lead to elimination or other reactions.

So perhaps the initial compound is an aniline derivative with a substituent that can undergo some reaction upon diazotization and hydrolysis.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any protons that would correspond to an amine. Unless it's an aromatic amine, which is usually around 5-6 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR data, the aromatic region is at 6.98 and 6.51. There's no peak around 5 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a nitro group? But the initial formula includes an N and an O, so maybe it's an amide or a nitrile. But I don't think so because of the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzylamine derivative. Let's think: If the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2, but that would have a primary amine. Then, upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl, it would form a diazonium chloride. Then, hydrolysis would give a phenol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the initial NMR has an aldehyde at 9.72. So perhaps the starting material has an aldehyde and an amine group.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a benzylamine with an aldehyde substituent. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with an amino group somewhere. But where? Maybe on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an aniline with a side chain that includes an aldehyde and a CH2 group. Let me think: Maybe something like Ph-NH-CH2-CHO. But that would have a primary amine, which would show up as a peak in the NMR, perhaps around 2-3 ppm as a NH2 proton, but I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps it's a secondary amine. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO. Wait, that would introduce an OH group, which I don't think is present in the initial structure, unless the reaction steps add it.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the NMR data and the reaction steps.

The aldehyde (9.72 ppm, triplet) suggests the structure has an aldehyde group adjacent to a CH2 group. So that CH2 is probably attached to something else, like an aromatic ring.

So perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO. But then we have 8 carbons: 6 in the benzene ring, plus 2 in CH2-CHO. So 8. That fits. But the formula is C8H9NO. Ph is C6H5, CH2-CHO is C2H3O. So the formula would be C8H8O. But wait, the given formula is C8H9NO, which includes an N. So that's an issue.

Hmm, so perhaps the structure has an amine group elsewhere. Let me think about C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 H's, one N, one O.

If the structure is diphenylamine with some substituents, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes an aldehyde and an amine. Wait, but aldehydes and amines are both reactive groups; would they be present together?

Wait, another approach: The first step is diazotization. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine. So, the structure has an aniline group. Then, when treated with NaNO2 and HCl, it forms a diazonium chloride.

After that, the second step is H2O. Maybe hydrolysis of the diazonium salt would give a phenol. So, if the starting compound is an aniline derivative, the product after hydrolysis would be a phenol.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a broad peak in the phenol region (like around 5 ppm). Hmm. Or perhaps the phenol is formed after the reaction.

Then, the third step is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a possible elimination reaction, maybe forming a carbonyl group or a double bond.

Wait, but the initial structure might have a structure that upon elimination would form an aldehyde or ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound has an amine attached to a benzene ring, and after diazotization and hydrolysis, that amine becomes a hydroxyl group. Then, under basic conditions, maybe an aldol condensation or some elimination happens.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2. But upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the amine becomes a hydroxyl group, so Ph-CH2-CH2-OH. Then treatment with KOH and heat might cause elimination, forming Ph-CH2-CHO (benzaldehyde derivative). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-NH2. Then, upon diazotization, it would form a diazonium salt, which hydrolyzes to a phenol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the hydroxyl group could be involved in elimination.

Wait, maybe the initial structure is an amino alcohol. For example, Ph-CH2-CHOH-NH2. Then, upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl, the amine would form a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis would become a phenol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an amine group elsewhere. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another angle: The NMR shows an aldehyde, which suggests the starting material has an aldehyde group. So maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but with an amino group attached to the benzene ring.

So the structure would be Ph-NH-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that would have the molecular formula C8H7NO2, because Ph is C6H5, CH2CHO is 3 carbons (CH2-CHO is two carbons?), wait no: Ph (C6H5) + CH2CHO (C3H4O) → C9H9O. But our formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with an amino group attached elsewhere on the benzene ring. Like para-substituted.

Wait, perhaps the structure is p-aminophenylacetaldehyde. That would be Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that's C8H7NO, and our formula is C8H9NO. Doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is p-aminobenzaldehyde (Ph-NH2-CHO), but that's C7H7NO. Doesn't fit either.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about the reactions again.

Step 1: NaNO2 and HCl. So, this is a diazotization reaction. So starting compound must have an aromatic amine group. So the structure must have an aniline group, i.e., NH2 attached to the benzene ring.

Step 2: H2O. Diazonium salt hydrolysis can produce a phenol if the conditions are aqueous and perhaps heated. For example, the diazonium salt can undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol when treated with water, especially under acidic conditions.

Step 3: Aqueous KOH and heat. This could be a base-catalyzed elimination or some sort of condensation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product after hydrolysis is a phenol with a side chain, and under basic conditions, it undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the initial compound is a benzylamine with an aldehyde group. Let me think. After diazotization and hydrolysis, the amine is replaced with a hydroxyl group. Then, under basic conditions, if there's a beta-hydroxy group, it might eliminate to form a carbonyl.

Wait, so perhaps the initial structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-NH2. After diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH, so we have Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-OH. Then, in basic conditions, elimination could occur, forming Ph-CH2-CHO (benzaldehyde derivative).

But wait, the molecular formula of the initial compound is C8H9NO. Let's calculate: Ph (C6H5) + CH2-CHO (C3H? O?), but including the NH2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the initial structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-OH. Then, in the presence of KOH and heat, perhaps elimination occurs, forming Ph-CH2-CHO. But that would require an OH and a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the triplet at 9.72 ppm suggests an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. So the initial structure probably has an aldehyde attached to a CH2 group, which is itself attached to another group.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with an amino group attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure would be p-aminophenylacetaldehyde
