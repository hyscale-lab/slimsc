Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with Grubbs catalyst and racemic compounds. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says, "Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?" The options are A to D.

First, I need to understand what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I remember, Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Olefin metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is particularly good for ring-closing metathesis, but it can also do ring-opening or cross metathesis.

The starting material here is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is at position 1, so the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH(CH₃)₂? Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂? No, wait. No wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. The formula would be CH₂=CH-C(H)(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me count.

No, wait, pent is five carbons. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the third carbon (the one after the double bond) has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The formula would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3) ? No, wait, no. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So carbon 1: CH₂=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), then carbon 4: CH2, and carbon 5: CH3? So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Yeah, that seems right. So the molecule is a five-carbon chain
