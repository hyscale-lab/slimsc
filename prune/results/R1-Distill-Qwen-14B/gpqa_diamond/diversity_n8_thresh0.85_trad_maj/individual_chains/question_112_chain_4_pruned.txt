Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the problem mentions calculating probabilities, which requires the state to be normalized (i.e., the sum of the probabilities equals 1).

Wait, right. The normalization condition is that the inner product of the state with itself should be 1. So, |alpha> is given as a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the inner product is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Wait, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). So the magnitude squared of each is (1^2 +1^2) for the first term, which is 2. And for the second term, (2^2 + (-1)^2) is 4 +1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is proportional, so the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part of the question is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given by A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Since we're dealing with a 2x2 system (because the state is a combination of up and down, which are two states), the matrix would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, wait. Because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, so the diagonal elements are 0, and off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

0   hbar/2
hbar/2   0

This is a 2x2 matrix. Hmm, what's this operator? It looks like it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the |up> and |down> states. But let me think about the eigenstates of this operator.

The eigenstates of this operator would be the same as those of the Pauli X matrix, because the structure is the same. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues +1 and -1, but scaled by a factor here.

Wait, the operator given is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on diagonal. So the actual operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. So sigma_x's eigenstates are |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Let me recall: sigma_x |+> = |+> and sigma_x |-> = -|->. Wait, no, actually sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, and sigma_x |−x> = -|−x>, so yes, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the eigenstates of operator A (which is (hbar/2) sigma_x) are these states. Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So I need to project the state |alpha> onto these eigenstates and find the probabilities.

Wait, but alternatively, since |alpha> is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, I can express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of A. Because the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, so any state can be expressed as a linear combination of these.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

The state |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

I can write |alpha> as ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Expressing |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

Substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) [ (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 -i) [ (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Expanding the numerator:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2-i)|+x> - (2-i)|−x> ) ] / (sqrt(14))

Combine like terms:

The coefficients for |+x> are (1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + i +2 - i = 3.

The coefficients for |−x> are (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, let me do that again.

Wait, for the |+x> terms:

(1+i) comes from the first term, and (2-i) comes from the second term. So (1+i) + (2-i) = 3.

For the |−x> terms:

(1+i) comes from the first term, and -(2 -i) comes from the second term. So (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So yes, the coefficients are 3 for |+x> and (-1 + 2i) for |−x>.

So,

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / sqrt(14)

The probability of measuring |+x> is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient of |+x>, divided by the normalization.

Wait, no. Wait, the state is expressed as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, so the probability for each is the square of the absolute value of the respective coefficient.

So the coefficient for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), and for |−x> it's (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

So the probability for |+x> is |3|^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

The probability for |−x> is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 /14. Let's compute |-1 + 2i|: sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )= sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5). So square is 5, so 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but let me compute it precisely.

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5. So the probability for |−x> is 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 and 5/14 is about 0.357143. Let's check: 9 +5 =14, so yes, they sum to 1.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 9/14 and 5/14. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7
So 0.64 is 64/100 = 16/25, which is about 0.64. 0.36 is 36/100=9/25. But 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357.

So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which don't match 9/14 and 5/14. Hmm. Let me see the other options.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7)
Hmm. 54 and 46 sum to 100, but 54/100 is 27/50=0.54, which is 0.54, but that's about 7.5/14=0.54. Close to 7.5/14≈0.5357.

Wait, not matching. Option C: 0.28, 0.72. 28+72=100. 0.28 is 28/100=7/25; 0.72 is 18/25. 7/25 is 0.28, which is 7/25, which is 0.28. Hmm, 7/25 is 0.28. But 9/14 is about 0.64, which is higher than 0.72 in option C. So it's not matching.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7). 0.61 is about 61/100, which is 61/100. 0.29 is 29/100. Hmm, that sums to 0.9, but wait, 0.61 +0.29=0.9, but that can't be right because probabilities should sum to 1. So option D's probabilities don't add up correctly. Wait, 0.61 +0.29 is 0.9, which is 90%, which can't be right because they should add up to 100% (1). So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Did I miscalculate the probabilities? Because I thought the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14), so their squared magnitudes are 9/14 and 5/14, as I had earlier. So that's approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. So the options don't have this exactly. Let me recheck the problem.

Wait, perhaps
