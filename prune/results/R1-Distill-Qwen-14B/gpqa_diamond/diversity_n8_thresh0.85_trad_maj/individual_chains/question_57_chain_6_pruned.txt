Okay, so I have this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts delta_0 through delta_4 as 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. The rest are ignored. I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which I think is along the initial direction of the electrons.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts? Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum [ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) ] for l from 0 to some maximum. But wait, in this case, we're looking at the imaginary part along the incident beam, so θ would be 0 degrees, right?

When θ is 0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1) because cos0 is 1. And I remember that P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the sum simplifies because P_l(1) =1 for every term. So f(θ=0) would be (1/k) * sum [ (2l +1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * 1 ] for each l present.

But wait, the problem mentions ignoring the rest of the phase shifts beyond delta_4. So I guess l goes from 0 to 4. Each term contributes (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Now, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im(f(0)), which is the imaginary component of sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] times (1/k).

Wait, let me make sure. The general expression is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^L [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) ] / k. So when θ=0, each term becomes (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sinδ_l * 1, because P_l(1)=1.

Wait, but the exponential term is e^{iδ_l}, which can be written as cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when I multiply by sin δ_l, each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l. Because the real part comes from the cosine term. So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be sum [(2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] * (1/k) * i.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for f is f = (1/k) times the sum. So the imaginary part is [sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l ] * (1/k) since each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, let me check. Each term in the sum: (2l+1) e^{i δ} sin δ. Let me factor that.

Because e^{i δ} sin δ = [cos δ + i sin δ] * sin δ = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ. So the imaginary part is the i sin² δ term. So for each l, the contribution to the imaginary part is (2l+1) * sin² δ_l.

So the total imaginary part is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin² δ_l (1/k).

Wait, but wait! Are we considering all the phase shifts up to l=4, and each contributes? So for l=0, l=1, up to l=4.

Wait, but the given data is delta_0=90°, delta_1=67°, delta_2=55°, delta_3=30°, delta_
