Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to figure this out. The question says that a Pi(+) particle, which is at rest, decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Hmm, right, in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? Or wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered massless, but in reality, they do have mass. But for the sake of this problem, I think I should treat the neutrino as massless unless told otherwise. Or maybe the problem expects us to treat it as massless because the options don't show a high KE for the neutrino, which would be possible if it's non-zero mass.

Wait, maybe in this problem, they're treating the neutrino as massless. So let's proceed under that assumption. So the neutrino has negligible mass, so its energy is approximately equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in MeV and using units where c=1, maybe it's just E = |p|.

So the process is π+ → μ+ + ν. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = -p_nu. But if the neutrino is massless, its energy is |p_nu|, and the muon's energy would be sqrt(p_mu^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c^2, but let's set c=1 for simplicity.

So the muon's energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and the neutrino's energy is p. The total energy must equal the rest mass of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.

Wait, but wait—the pion's rest energy is its rest mass times c squared, which is 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies must be 139.6 MeV.

So, E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu = sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4) / c^2 → with c=1, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). And E_nu = p (since for a massless particle, E = pc).

So, sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, let me write that equation: sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me solve for p. Let me denote m_mu as 105.7 MeV/c², but since we're in units where c=1, it's 105.7 MeV.

So the equation becomes sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides: sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides: p² + 105.7² = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p².

So, p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides: 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

Let me compute the squares. Let's do 105.7^2 and 139.6^2.

105.7^2 = approximately (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

139.6^2 is let's see: (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So putting back into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 p.

Wait, no, the equation is 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Wait, wait, 2*139.6 is 279.2.

So, rearranging:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Hmm, 19488 minus
