Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and their kinetic energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. And the pion is at rest, which probably means the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions because of conservation of momentum. But wait, since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out. That means their magnitudes are equal but directions opposite.

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the decay products must have opposite momenta. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But neutrinos are neutral and super light, almost massless. Wait, the muon has a rest mass, so it's going to have some kinetic energy, and the neutrino, being light, will have a higher energy, maybe? Or wait, no, the neutrino is a lepton, but in this case, the muon is the charged lepton, and the neutrino is the other part.

Wait, the problem gives the rest masses: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c². So the rest mass of the neutrino is negligible, I think. Or is it considered zero? Because in the Standard Model, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but for the sake of problems, sometimes they're treated as massless. So I guess here, the neutrino's mass is zero.

So, the total energy released in the decay is the mass of the pion minus the rest mass of the muon. Because the neutrino is almost massless, its rest mass is negligible.

So, the Q value of the reaction (the total energy available) is Q = m_pi c² - m_mu c². Since the pion is at rest, all the energy comes from its rest mass. So,

Q = (139.6 - 105.7) MeV = 33.9 MeV.

Wait, but how is this energy distributed between the muon and the neutrino? Since the pion is at rest and the decay products must go in opposite directions, their energies would depend on their masses and the conservation laws.

Let me recall the formula for energy and momentum in such decay processes. The total energy after decay must equal the rest energy of the pion because all the energy comes from the pion's rest mass.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

But also, the total momentum must be zero, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Wait, but for the muon, which has mass, the energy is E_mu = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), and since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = pc. Because for massless particles, E = pc.

So, putting that together:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) 

E_nu = p c 

And the sum E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

So let me write that as:

sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 c^4 ) + p c = 139.6 c^2 

Wait, wait, units are in MeV. Let's make sure the units are consistent. Let's think in terms of units where c=1, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momenta in MeV/c.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

E_nu = p 

Because E_nu = p c, but c=1, so E_nu = p.

So the equation becomes:

sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me denote p as x for simplicity. So,

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x =
