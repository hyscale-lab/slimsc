Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm. The question involves an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the standard spin-up and spin-down states.

The problem asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation A where Aij is hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Then I also need to find the average value of this operator.

Wait, so operator A is a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. The eigenstates of A would be the basis for the measurement probabilities. Let me think about what operator A looks like. Since A has 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So for a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that's interesting. This looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by (hbar/2). Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * X. Oh wait, so the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X are the states |+> and |->, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So |+x> and |−x> states. Because the Pauli X operator represents the spin in the x-direction.

So, the first step is to find the eigenstates of A. Let me recall that the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? So these are the |+x> and |−x> states.

So the measurement probabilities are the probabilities of |alpha> being in each of these eigenstates. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the |+x> and |−x> basis.

Wait, but wait. The original state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I should first normalize this state. Because it's proportional, the actual state would be (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> divided by the norm.

Let me compute the norm. The norm squared is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2 - i)*(2 + i). Let's calculate that. 

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 +2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) =5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to compute the overlap of |alpha>
