Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions. 

The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. And the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. We're supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions. Oh wait, right, because the complex dissociates a bit, releasing some Ca²+ ions.

So, the formula for the formation constant K is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in various protonated forms. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal. I think that implies that all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+ effectively, maybe the deprotonated form Y^4-.

Wait, so if the pH is ideal, the problem is assuming that the concentration of EDTA^4- is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration. Or wait, no. Because when EDTA complexes with Ca²+, the complex is CaY²–. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact charges, but I think that the formation constant given is for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and K is 5e10.

So, in solution, the major species are the complex, and some free Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the problem gives the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So that's the total concentration of CaY²−, right?

Wait, wait. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the total concentration of Ca²+ in solution would be governed by the dissociation of this complex.

So, the dissociation is:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−.

The formation constant Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) =5e10.

But wait, wait, the formation constant is usually written as Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). So yes.

Now, considering that the solution starts with 0.02 M CaY²−. So initially, [CaY²−] =0.02, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] are zero. But as it dissociates a bit, a small x amount will dissociate, so:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is very large, x will be very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02).

[Ca²+] = x

[Y^4−] = x

So Kf = (0.02)/(x^2) )=5e10.

Wait, because [CaY²−] is 0.02, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] are both x.

So rearranging: x^2 = (0.02)/(5e10)

x^2 = 2e-12 /5? Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/5) *1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5= approx 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)=sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13)=2*1e-6.5= 2*(3.16e-7)=6.32e-7.

So x=6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but did I make any mistake? Let me double-check.

Formation constant K=5e10. So K= [CaY]/([Ca][Y])=5e10.

Assuming that the dissociation is small, so [CaY] ≈0.02.

So 0.02 / (x^2) =5e10 → x²=0.02/(5e10)=2e-2/(5e10)= (2/5)*1e-12= 0.4e-12=4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5= approx 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Assuming the dissociation is small, the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M, while the free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) and free EDTA ions ([Y⁴⁻]) are equal due to stoichiometry. Let the concentration of dissociated ions be \( x \).

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \) and \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x \), we get:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
