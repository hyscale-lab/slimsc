Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, the problem says that a Pi-plus particle is at rest and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi-plus is 139.6 MeV, mu-plus is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, wait. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total momentum before and after must be conserved. Since the Pi is initially at rest, the total momentum after decay should be zero. That means the momenta of the mu-plus and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. Oh wait, the muon has a rest mass of about 105.7 MeV, so it's actually quite heavy compared to the neutrino. But neutrinos are considered massless in many approximations, right? Or maybe here we can treat the neutrino as massless for simplicity.

Wait, but in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for this problem, since the mass isn't given, perhaps we can assume it's zero. Or maybe the problem doesn't provide the neutrino's mass, so it's intended to be treated as massless. Hmm, the problem statement doesn't mention the neutrino's mass, so I think it's safe to assume it's zero.

So, let me think about energy and momentum conservation.

The initial energy is just the rest energy of the Pi-plus since it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

In the decay products, the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass m_mu = 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest energy. The neutrino is assumed massless, so its energy E_nu is equal to its momentum magnitude times c. 

Since momentum must be conserved, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude). Let's denote p_mu as p and p_nu as p as well, but opposite in direction.

So for energy conservation:

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2 times c^2? Wait, I think I should work in units where c=1, so energies are in MeV, masses in MeV/c², but since c=1, we can just say masses are in MeV.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me reorganize.

In natural units where c=1, the energy of the muon is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and the energy of the neutrino is |p|, since its mass is zero.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

This must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So the equation is:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me write that as:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi

Hmm, solving for p.

Let me let x = p. Then,

sqrt(x^2 + a^2) + x = b,

where a is 105.7 and b is 139.6.

So,

sqrt(x^2 + a^2) = b - x

Square both sides:

x^2 + a^2 = (b - x)^2 = b² - 2b x + x².

The x² terms cancel:

a² = b² - 2b x.

So,

2b x = b² - a²

x = (b² - a²)/(2b)

Plugging in the numbers:

b = 139.6 MeV, a =105.7 MeV.

So,

x = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)

Let me compute the numerator first.

139.6^2 = let's compute 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7^2: Let's see, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross term 2 *100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 *139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (because 279.2 *30=8376, subtract 279.2 gives 8096.8). 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87. So 29 + (218.87 /279.2) ≈ 29 + ~0.783 ≈ 29.783 MeV.

So x ≈ 29.783 MeV. Wait, that's the value of p, the momentum of the muon.

But wait, that's not the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute that: 29.783^2 is about 886.7 (since 30^2 is 900, so 29.783 is a bit less, say 886.7). 105.7^2 is 11172.49. So sum is 12059.19. Square root is sqrt(12059.19) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, wait, because 109.8^2 is 12056.04, which is close to 12059. So E_mu is about 109.8 MeV.

But the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p, which is approximately 29.78 MeV. So the neutrino has 29.78 MeV of energy, and since it's massless, that's all kinetic energy.

So the two KEs are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → no, too low.

B)7.2, 32.8 → no.

C)3.52, 20.8 → nope.

D)4.12, 29.8 → yes, that's close to what I got.

Wait, but wait, I think maybe I made a rounding error. Let me recheck the calculations more accurately.

Compute (139.6)^2 accurately:

139.6 * 139.6.

Let me compute 139 * 139 = (140-1)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*1 +1 = 19600 -280 +1=19321.

Now for 0.6^2=0.36.

Then cross terms: 2*(139)(0.6) = 166.8.

So 139.6^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7^2: Let's compute 105^2=11025. 0.7^2=0.49. Cross term 2*105*0.7=147. So (105+0.7)^2=11025 +147 +0.49=11172.49 MeV².

Numerator: 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So x=8315.67 / 279.2 → let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2:

279.2 * 29 is 279.2 * 30 =8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

So 29 + 218.87/279.2 → 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So x≈29.783 MeV.

So p ≈29.783 MeV/c.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

29.783^2= (30 -0.217)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.217 + 0.217^2 =900 -13.02 + 0.047=886.027.

105.7^2=11172.49.

So sum is 886.027+11172.49=12058.517.

sqrt(12058.517)= well, 109.8^2=12056.04. 109.81^2= (109.8)^2 + 2*109.8*0.01 + 0.01^2= 12056.04 + 2.196 +0.000001=12058.236.

So 109.81^2= ~12058.236, which is just a bit less than 12058.517. The difference is about 12058.517-12058.236=0.281.

So let me see how much more than 109.81 is needed.

Let delta x be 0.001, then (109.81 + delta x)^2 ≈109.81^2 + 2*109.81 * delta x.

Set 109.81^2 + 2*109.81 * delta x =12058.517.

We have 12058.236 + 219.62 * delta x =12058.517.

219.62 * delta x= 0.281 → delta x≈0.281/219.62≈0.001276.

So E_mu ≈109.81 +0.001276≈109.8113 MeV.

So E_mu= approximately 109.811 MeV.

The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu=E_mu - m_mu=109.811 -105.7=4.111 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p=29.783 MeV, which is its kinetic energy (since massless).

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Given:**
- The Pi(+) particle is stationary and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino.
- Rest mass of Pi(+): \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of mu(+): \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Neutrino is assumed to be massless (\( m_{\nu} = 0 \)).

### Key Principles:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved.
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its energy is purely its rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the Pi(+) is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Muon**: The total energy of the muon is given by:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
   \]
   The kinetic energy of the muon is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu}.
   \]

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**: Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Solving for \( p_{\mu} \) and \( p_{\nu} \):
Using energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}.
\]
Let \( p_{\mu} = p \). Then:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \( p^2 \) and solving for \( p \):
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p,
\]
\[
2 m_{\pi} p = m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]

### Substituting Values:
- \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \).

1. Compute \( m_{\pi}^2 \) and \( m_{\mu}^2 \):
   \[
   m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2,
   \]
   \[
   m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
   \]

2. Compute \( p \):
   \[
   p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies:
1. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.783^2 + 105.7^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:
   Since the neutrino is massless:
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p = 29.783 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.11 MeV** and **29.78 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV — Incorrect.
- **B)** 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV — Incorrect.
