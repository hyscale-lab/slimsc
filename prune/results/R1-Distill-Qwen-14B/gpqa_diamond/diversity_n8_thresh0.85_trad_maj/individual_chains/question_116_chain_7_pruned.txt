Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. The options are all cyclohexenol derivatives with different substituents and stereochemistry. Hmm, I'll need to figure out each step carefully.

First, let's break down the information given.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the number of protons corresponds to the integration value. So, 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet.

What structures give these signals? Let me think. A triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm is probably from two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. Because each CH3 has 3H, so two would give 6H. And they're next to a CH2, so the splitting would be a triplet. Wait, wait. Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to something else. Let me think: the triplet arises when a proton is next to two neighboring protons. No, wait, the splitting depends on neighboring non-equivalent protons. Oh right, for a triplet, the neighboring group has two protons. So if the triplet is for 6H, it could be two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CH-CH2- something. But I'm not sure yet.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each proton is split into four peaks, which usually comes from coupling with three neighboring protons. Because the splitting follows the n+1 rule, where n is the number of neighboring protons. So for a quartet, n=3. So each H in that signal is next to three equivalent Hs. Alternatively, maybe the quartet comes from two sets of equivalent Hs, but I'm not sure. Wait, 4H as a quartetâ€”so each H is coupled to three Hs. So maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3, but that would give a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2 in between two CH2 groups. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to something else.

Wait, another thought: the triplet (6H) at 0.9 ppm is typical of two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Like (CH3)2CHCH2-. Then, the quartet (4H) at 1.3 ppm would be the CH2 next to the CH(CH3)2. Because in such a case, the CH2 would be next to a CH that has two CH3 groups. Let's draw this:

(CH3)2CH-CH2-CH2-...? No, wait. Let's think about the possible structure. Maybe it's a diethyl group. Because diethyl ether, for example, has CH2CH3 groups. But wait, diethyl ether's NMR would have a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the CH2. Oh wait, the problem here has a triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H. Let me calculate. Each CH3 in diethyl ether would have 3H, so two CH3 groups would be 6H as a triplet. The adjacent CH2 would have 2H as a quartet. So that fits. So the structure of compound A would be diethyl ether: CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. But wait, no, because diethyl ether's structure is CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. So each CH2CH3 group has 2H in the CH2 and 3H in the CH3. But wait, the NMR would show the CH3 as a triplet because they are next to the CH2 (which has 2H; so the triplet), and the CH2 would be a quartet because each H is adjacent to the OCH2CH3's CH3 (but wait, O is electronegative, but in diethyl ether, the CH2 groups are adjacent to each other via the oxygen. So for the CH3 groups, each is adjacent to a CH2, so they would be a triplet. The CH2 groups are next to an O and another CH2. Wait, perhaps in diethyl ether, the CH2 groups would be split into a quartet because each CH2 is next to another CH2. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, another possibility: compound A could be ethyl propyl ether or something else, but the NMR seems to suggest two sets of signals: one triplet (6H) and one quartet (4H). Another possibility is that the structure is neopentyl something. Wait, neopentyl is 2,2-dimethylpropyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps compound A is a diether or maybe a cyclic ether. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diastereomer of some sort. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. No, but the NMR doesn't show any signals that suggest a ring, like a singlet for equivalent protons.

Wait, but if the triplet is 6H, perhaps it's from two equivalent methyl groups attached to a CH2, and the quartet is from another CH2. Like CH2CH3CH2CH2... Wait, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the structure is 2,2-dimethylbutane or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of diethyl ether is a quartet for the CH2CH3 groups. Wait, no, in diethyl ether, the CH3 groups are next to CH2, so each CH3 would be a triplet. The CH2 would be a quartet because each H is next to the oxygen and the other CH2. So the CH2 would be a quartet if they are coupling with two different sets of Hs. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let me think. For diethyl ether (CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3), each CH3 is next to a CH2. So the CH3 would be a triplet because they're adjacent to a CH2 with two Hs. The CH2 groups would be next to the O and another CH2. Each H in the CH2 is adjacent to the O and the other CH2. Maybe the splitting is a quartet because each H is next to the three Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, no. Each H in the CH2 in diethyl ether is adjacent to the O and the other CH2. So each H in the CH2 would be next to three Hs (
