Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about some molecular biology techniques and mouse genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair that's expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate by using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, I remember that bicistronic vectors have two coding sequences in one transcript, often separated by an IRES element. So each gene can be independently expressed.

The vector setup: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. Wait, but there are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. Oh right, loxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So, in the ligand part, between the ORF and mCherry, there's a stop with loxP. And in the receptor, between it and eGFP, there's a stop with lox2272. 

So, the idea is probably that when Cre is present, it will recombine these sites, removing the stop cassettes. So, the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed together.

Now, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the control of an IRES, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed as a separate transcript or maybe in the same one? Wait, no, IRES is usually in the same mRNA but allows for the translation of the second gene without a stop in between. But in bicistronic vectors, the first gene is translated, then the ribosome dissociates, and the IRES allows the ribosome to reinitiate translation of the second gene. So, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, so I think that's a control for total protein loading. But after transfecting into primary astrocytes, they didn't see the expected signals? Or perhaps when they looked at the mice, they didn't see green? Wait, the question says they crossed the mouse model to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre would be expressed under SOX10's control, which is in neural crest cells.

So, in the mouse model, when the Cre is active, it would recombine the lox sites. The vector is designed so that in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed, along with their fluorescent tags.

But when they looked under the confocal, they didn't see a green signal. Green is from eGFP, which is attached to the receptor. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in the vector, both are being expressed in the same cells, so it's autocrine or maybe endocrine. Not sure how this affects expression levels. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't showing up. Maybe the ligand and receptor are not expressed? But why?

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it should be in the cell membrane. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be expressed on the surface, so you wouldn't see GFP in the cell. But the eGFP is probably on the receptor, which should be on the membrane. So if it's stuck in the Golgi, you wouldn't see the fluorescence. But in the experiment, they didn't observe green. But why would that happen? Only if the construct isn't expressed. But they did a Western blot with the antibodies. Oh, wait, the question says they used the antibodies to test the construct's expression after transfection but in primary astrocytes. So perhaps the expression wasn't happening as expected.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both the ligand and receptor are expressed under their own promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so it should be expressed regardless. The receptor is under an IRES, which usually requires the same promoter as the upstream gene. Wait, no, in bicistronic constructs, the IRES allows for the second gene to be expressed without a promoter. So the receptor would be expressed only if the first gene's promoter is active. Hmm, but I'm not sure. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor might not be expressed. But in this case, the vector has the ligand under a promoter, and the receptor under IRES. So if the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But why would that happen? Are the lox sites causing issues?

Wait, the vector has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after the ligand ORF. So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry, but only when the loxP is recombined. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272 cassette after it, so the eGFP is only expressed when that lox is recombined. But in the presence of Cre, the lox sites are recombined, removing the stop cassettes. So that would allow both ligand ORF and the receptor ORF to be expressed.

Wait, but the Cre is introduced via the SOX10-Cre mice. So when the mouse is bred, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the vector's stop cassettes are removed, so both ligand and receptor are expressed.

But in the Western blot, when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes (which might not express Cre), maybe the Cre wasn't active, so the stop cassettes weren't removed, and the ligand and receptor weren't expressed. But the question says that the blot was after transfection. Oh, unless the plasmid is designed such that the Cre is needed for expression. Wait, but the vectors are loxP and lox2272, which are different. LoxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutant that can't recombine with wild-type LoxP. So, the stop cassettes are only removed when both lox sites are the same and Cre is present.
