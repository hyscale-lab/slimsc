Okay, so I need to figure out this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're told the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think that means we can use the Boltzmann equation here. 

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels to the temperature. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Oh right, the ratio is exponential based on the energy difference and temperature.

In this case, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So for star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of their ratios. Let me clarify: if in star_1, the excited level is twice as populated compared to star_2. So the ratio for star_1 would be, say, 2 * (ratio for star_2). 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy levels are the same because it's the same transition, right? So the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. 

Let me define variables. Let’s say for star 1, the ratio is N1_upper / N1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly for star 2, it's N2_upper / N2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But wait, the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited compared to star_2. So I think that means N1_upper / N1_lower is twice (N2_upper / N2_lower). Or maybe it's the ratio of excitation compared to each other. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, if I think of the excitation as the population in the upper level, then N1_upper = 2 * N2_upper? Or wait, no. Because each star has its own N_lower. Maybe it's the ratio N_upper/(N_upper + N_lower) that's twice. Alternatively, maybe the ratio N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. That makes more sense.

Wait, let me think. For star 1, the excitation is twice as much as star 2. So the ratio (N_upper/N_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

(N1_upper)/(N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper)/(N2_lower)

Using the Boltzmann equation, that becomes:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Because the ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star 1, the
