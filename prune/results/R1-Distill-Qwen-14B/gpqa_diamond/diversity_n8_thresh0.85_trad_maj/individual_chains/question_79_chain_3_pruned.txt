Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to find out what X is.

Wait, what's the reaction here? Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, I think. Oh, right! It's used in the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction. But wait, no, that's for ketones to give alcohols with high enantioselectivity. Or wait, another possibility—maybe it's an epoxidation? No, wait, epoxidation is usually done with peracids. Or maybe it's an elimination reaction? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU? No, wait, DBU is 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene. Oh right, so this is another base, perhaps used for eliminations. Wait, but given that the starting material is compound X and the product's NMR is given, perhaps X is a diene or something else that would undergo a reaction with this base.

Wait, but wait, the product has an epoxide? Because the options are epoxides. Wait, the product's 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7. That's a high chemical shift, which is typical for a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm. Wait, wait, maybe it's a ketone? Or maybe it's an ester?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation. Oh, because epoxidation would form an epoxide, which has two adjacent carbons with O in between. So the reaction conditions might be using a peracid, but wait, the reagent here is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, another thought: maybe compound X is a diene and the reaction forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. But wait, the product's NMR doesn't show an epoxide ring necessarily. Let me look at the NMR data.

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s)—so two singlets, each 3H. Those are probably two methyl groups, maybe attached to an electronegative atom or in an environment that deshields them. Wait, but singlet means no neighboring Hs. For methyl groups, that's typical for something like CH3 attached to, say, an oxygen or maybe in a ring where the adjacent carbons don't have Hs. Or perhaps geminal to another group.

Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That seems like a pair of doublets for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Wait, like perhaps a styrene group or something. Let me think: the aromatic region. The 6.75 (d) is maybe a H adjacent to an electronegative group, like a substituent. Then, 7.08 (2H, d)—could be two Hs on a benzene ring that are adjacent to substituents. Similarly, 7.68 (d) and 7.71 (d) could be another pair.

Wait, maybe the aromatic signals are from a substituent on a benzene ring, perhaps a styryl group. So maybe the product is an epoxide with a styryl substituent. Or perhaps the product has a styryl group and an epoxide.

Looking at the 13C NMR: the peaks at 21.3 and 28.4 are likely CH3 groups. The 126.9 and 127.1 are probably carbons from an aromatic ring or double bond. The 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbons attached to oxygen or part of a conjugated system. The 197.7 is a very high ppm, which is characteristic of a ketone or aldehyde, but wait, maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides usually have carbons around 50-70. Hmm, maybe that's a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone? But wait, the reaction was with a base—could it be an oxidation? Or perhaps the reaction is deoxygenation?

Wait, maybe I should think about the starting material. The options are all epoxide types. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an epoxide (oxirane) with a styryl group (a substituted ethylene) attached at the 2-position. The styryl group is at the 4-methyl position. So the styryl would be CH2-C6H4-CH2- but I'm not sure. Wait, 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group attached at the 4 position, and the styryl (CH2CH-) is attached to that.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane is at position 2, and the substituent is a propenyl group attached at position 2, which is connected to a phenyl group. So structure would be like oxirane with a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group attached.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has methyl at 2 and styryl at 3. So the structure would be a three-membered ring with O, with substituents at 2 (CH3) and 3 (styryl).

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is at position 2, with a styryl group.

Wait, but wait, all options are epoxides. So the product is an epoxide, and the reaction conditions would have to form an epoxide. So how does 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane come into play for epoxide formation
