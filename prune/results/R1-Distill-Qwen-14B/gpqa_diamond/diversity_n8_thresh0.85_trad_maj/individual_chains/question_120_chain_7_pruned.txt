Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax. Hmm, parallax is something to do with distance, right? I think parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, the farther away a star is, the smaller its parallax. Oh right, the formula is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I imagine a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their number density is uniform in some way.

Wait, uniform distribution in the sky. But when considering their distance, how does that translate? Because even if they are spread out in space, the number of stars you can see at a particular distance depends on the volume, I think.

Wait, let's think in terms of volume. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, right? So if the distribution is uniform, the number density (n) is constant.

But how does parallax relate to volume? Parallax is 1/d. So if I have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, but a thin shell is the derivative, which is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

Now, parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. The number of stars in a shell at distance d is n * 4π ( (1/plx) )² * (dd). But wait, we're considering a unit range of parallax. So what's the change in parallax when d changes by dd?

Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So if d changes by dd, plx changes by d(plx) = - (dd)/d². Because derivative of 1/d is -1/d². So d(plx) = - (dd) / (d^2) → dd = - d² d(plx).

But since we're dealing with a small range, we can ignore the negative sign and consider the absolute value. So dd = (d²) d_plx.
