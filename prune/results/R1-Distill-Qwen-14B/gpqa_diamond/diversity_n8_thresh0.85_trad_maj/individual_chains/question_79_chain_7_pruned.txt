Alright, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question involves identifying Compound X based on an NMR analysis of a product formed after a reaction. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors, like alkenes. So, I think Compound X must have an alkene group that, when reacted with this reagent, forms an epoxide.

Looking at the formula of Compound X: C11H12O. Wait, so after the reaction, the product is formed. But the question gives us the NMR data of the product, and we need to backtrack to find what X was.

Let me think about the results. The product's 1H NMR has several signals. Let's list them:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Maybe a CH3 connected to an electronegative atom or a ring.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet. Another methyl group. So two methyl groups here.
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet, maybe an aromatic proton adjacent to another proton.
- δ 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Possibly in a para-substituted benzene ring, or maybe part of a substituent.
- δ 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet. Maybe adjacent to another proton.
- δ 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Possibly from an aromatic ring.

The 13C NMR data:
- 21.3 (1C, s): A carbon attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Maybe a CH3 attached to oxygen, like in an epoxide (O-C-C-O), but wait, 21.3 is a bit low for a CH3 attached to an oxygen. Wait, I remember that in epoxides, the carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm. Hmm, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows 21.3 and 28.4 as singlets. Those are likely two methyl carbons. Let me think: 21.3 is around where a methyl group attached to a benzene ring (like toluene) is. 28.4 could be another type of methyl, maybe attached to oxygen, like in an epoxide ring.

Wait, in an epoxide, the carbons are usually around 40-60 ppm. So 28.4 might not fit that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe one of the methyl groups is part of a substituent on the ring.

Looking at the aromatic carbons:

126.9 (2C, s): Two carbons at this region. Maybe part of a benzene ring, perhaps in ortho or para positions. 

127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s). So the aromatic region is a bit complex. The higher ppm values (141.5 and 144.1) are likely carbons attached to substituents, like in a styrene group or an epoxide.

Wait, the 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon? But wait, that's a high value. Oh wait, no, wait—epoxide rings don't have carbonyl groups. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl from another functional group. Alternatively, could there be an ester or ketone? But given the reaction conditions, it's more likely that the product is an epoxide. Hmm, maybe 197.7 is an oxygenated carbon, like an epoxide carbon. Wait, I thought epoxide carbons are lower, around 50-60. But perhaps if there's a neighboring substituent, the chemical shift could be higher? Or maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is not an epoxide but something else. But given the reaction conditions, which use Sharpless reagent, it's more likely an epoxidation.

Wait, but wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is used in epoxidation, especially for cis-dihydroxylation but wait, no, that's the other reagent, OsO4. Sharpless epoxidation uses that reagent for asymmetric epoxidation. So, Compound X must have a double bond that becomes an epoxide.

So, the product would have an epoxide ring. Looking into the NMR data, perhaps the two singlet methyl groups (δ 2.28 and 2.31) are attached to the epoxide. Because in epoxide, each oxygen is connected to two carbons, which are each connected to other groups. If those groups are -CH3, then each of the epoxide carbons would be connected to a methyl group.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR, the two singlets are 3H each. So perhaps the epoxide has two methyl groups attached. So the epoxide would be something like O-C(CH3)-C(CH3)-O, but that can't be right because that would require two CH3 groups on each carbon, which would likely lead to more splitting.
