Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two ORFs: one for the ligand and one for the receptor.

Let me visualize the vector structure. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry. But wait, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry. And the receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP fused at the C-terminus. Between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So the vector is set up with two separate stops. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. I remember that IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, which can drive the translation of the downstream ORF, even in the presence of a stop codon earlier in the mRNA. So the CBA promoter would drive the expression of the ligand, and the IRES would help in the expression of the receptor, perhaps co-expressed from the same mRNA but in a separate reading frame.

Now, when they use lox-Cre, which is a recombinase, it should recognize the loxP sites and cause recombination. If I'm correct, Cre would excise the loxP-stop-loxP cassette in the ligand region, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, in the receptor region, perhaps another lox site is used.

Wait, but the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is after IRES. So the mRNA would be a single transcript. The IRES would allow the receptor to be translated without the ligand's stop codon being a problem.

But then, after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture, they use antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. On Western blot, they see signals proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So the proteins are being expressed, but when they look in the mouse model, they don't see a green signal, which is from eGFP.

They breed a mouse homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be expressed under SOX10's regulation, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells, like the cells where the ligand and receptor are supposed to be expressed.

But the question is why there's no green signal. The eGFP should be expressed if the receptor is properly expressed and the construct works.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in the vector, both are under the same promoter and in the same cell, so they should be expressed in the same cell. Paracrine wouldn't prevent eGFP expression. So probably not A.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking properly, perhaps eGFP wouldn't be on the surface and wouldn't fluoresce. But if the construct is bad, maybe the protein isn't made. But they saw expression in Western blot. Hmm, but Western blot detects proteins regardless of localization. If the receptor-eGFP is made but not on the cell surface, maybe the eGFP wouldn't show up under confocal, which looks for surface expression. But why would it get stuck in the Golgi? Maybe because of a stop codon or frame issue. Wait, the stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So the eGFP would only be expressed if the cassette is excised. But in the presence of Cre, the lox2272 would be cut, removing the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, in the vector setup, the ligand and mCherry are in a loxP-stop cassette, so when Cre is present, this is excised, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272 cassette between it and eGFP. So Cre (loxP recomb.) would excise the lox2272, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, Cre should excise the loxP and lox2272 sites, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the Western blot, when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, which presumably don't express Cre, the stops would remain. So the ligand and mCherry wouldn't be expressed (because the stop is in between), but the receptor might be expressed if the IRES allows it, but the eGFP would be stopped. Wait, but the vector is designed so that without Cre, the ligand and mCherry are separated by a stop; same for receptor and eGFP.

Wait, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression downstream. So in primary astrocytes (without Cre), the ligand and mCherry would not be co-expressed, but the receptor would be under IRES, allowing its expression. But the eGFP would have a stop in the lox2272 cassette, so it's not expressed.

But when they make a mouse that's homozygous for the construct, and cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes in the cells where SOX10 is active (so neural crest cells). So in these cells, the ligand should be expressed (since the loxP cassette is gone), and the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

But in the offspring, when they look under the confocal, they don't see green. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, how is that possible? The eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the stop is in the lox2272 cassette, then when the stop is removed
