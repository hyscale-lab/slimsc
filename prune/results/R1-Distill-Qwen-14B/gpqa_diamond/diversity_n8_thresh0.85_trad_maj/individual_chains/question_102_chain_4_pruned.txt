Alright, so I've got this question here about a genetics experiment, and I'm trying to figure out what's going wrong. Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So two coding regions in one vector. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. So the vector probably looks like this: ligand (CBA promoter) -> stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) -> mCherry. Then after that, the IRES element, followed by the receptor ORF and then eGFP with another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272).

Wait, wait, I think I might have that backwards. Oh wait, no. The vector is set up so that ligand is first, then receptor next. So the structure is: 5' -> CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette (loxP) -> mCherry ORF. Then, after that, there's an IRES element, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated. So after IRES, the receptor ORF, then stop cassette (lox2272) -> eGFP.

When Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the expression of mCherry and eGFP. Because the stop cassettes are flanked by loxP sites, Cre would cut them out, so the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

Now, the researchers transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. But when they visualized the mice under a confocal, they didn't see a green signal. Green is eGFP, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or isn't fluorescent.

Wait, but why? Let's think about the setup. The vector is a bicistronic construct with two cassettes. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES, which is a weaker promoter but allows for expression without a separate promoter.

But when they used SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre would excise the loxP sites. So in the ligand part, the stop cassette would be removed, so ligand and mCherry would be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed together after the IRES.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, and they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells. Oh, but wait, in the initial question, the ligand and receptor were expressed in neural crest cells. Hmm.

But the problem is that after crossing, the offspring don't show green fluorescence. So why isn't eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But
