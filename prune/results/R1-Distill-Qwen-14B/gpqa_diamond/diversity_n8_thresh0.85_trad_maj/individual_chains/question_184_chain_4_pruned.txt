Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. That's a mouthful, so I need to break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position numbering might be tricky, but I'll do my best. Let me sketch it out.

Wait, in benzene, the numbering is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So let's see: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the ring has these three substituents adjacent to each other? Or maybe it's a meta arrangement? Hmm, but 1, 2, 3 are adjacent if they're in a row. Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, 1,2,3 are adjacent in a way that each is next to the other two. So 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6, 2 is adjacent to 1,3, and so on. So 1,2,3 would form a sort of triangle, but in a six-membered ring, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that each is adjacent to the next. Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are in a meta arrangement? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the synthesis steps.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So the benzene ring must undergo three different substitution reactions.

But wait, benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. Each substitution step must be in a specific order to get the desired product.

Now, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Or wait, perhaps it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So in the ring, each substituent is adjacent to the next.

But the exact positions might depend on the order of substitution and the directing effects of each group.

The problem is to find the correct sequence of reactions from the options given, which are options A to D.

Each option lists a series of steps, so I need to figure out which sequence leads to the correct compound.

I think the order of substitution is important because each substituent can direct the next substitution. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, while ethoxy groups are ortho/para directors. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating group? Wait, no. Wait, tert-butyl is a bulky alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating (since they're electron donating via induction, but are bulky, so they direct ortho/para but might hinder substitution in the ortho positions due to steric hindrance.

Wait, but the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about their directing effects.

Ethoxy group: it's an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group, which is an electron donor by resonance), so it's ortho/para directing.

tert-butyl group: it's a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group, so electron-donating via induction). So it's ortho/para directing, but steric hindrance can make para more favorable.

Nitro group: it's a deactivating, meta-directing group.

So, when adding substituents, the order and the directing effects will determine where the next substituent goes.

The target molecule has three substituents, so there are two substitution steps after the first.

But wait, benzene itself doesn't have any substituents, so the first substitution will add the first group.

But wait, the target has three substituents, so perhaps two substitution reactions and one maybe a nitration or something else? Or perhaps multiple steps with different reagents.

Wait, looking at the options, each option lists multiple steps. Let's think about the steps.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's think about how to build this.

First, perhaps I should plan the order of substituent addition.

I remember that when multiple substituents are present, the directing effect of the strongest director (the group that is most activating or deactivating) will dominate. So, if a
