Okay, so I have this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they provided the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. We need to figure out which compound X it is from the options given.

Hmm. So first, compound X is reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, that's a common base, sometimes used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, or maybe in elimination reactions. But wait, in the context of epoxides, it might be involved in acid-base reactions, like opening epoxides through ring-opening reactions, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be a base that deprotonates something, leading to elimination.

But wait, looking at the product's NMR, let's think about what kind of product we're looking at. The product has a molecular formula of C11H12O, same as compound X. So maybe it's a rearrangement or an elimination, but perhaps an epoxidation or something else.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR shows some signals. Let me jot them down:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So there are two singlets for 3H each. Those are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals, maybe attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or in a symmetric environment. Wait, but in the product, maybe these are CH3 groups attached to carbonyls or something else that doesn't cause splitting.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

13C NMR:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Hmm, the 197.7 is a carbonyl, probably a ketone or an ester, but wait, the product's formula is C11H12O. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the reaction conditions: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base. Maybe it's deprotonating something. If compound X is an epoxide, perhaps it's reacting in a ring-opening. But then, the product might have a carbonyl group if it's an elimination.

Alternatively, maybe compound X is an epoxide that upon reaction forms a carbonyl. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all these options are epoxides. So the reaction is probably opening an epoxide. When an epoxide opens, like under basic conditions, it can lead to a diol or maybe form a more substituted structure.

But the product's NMR has a carbonyl peak at 197.7. That's quite upfield for a carbonyl—
