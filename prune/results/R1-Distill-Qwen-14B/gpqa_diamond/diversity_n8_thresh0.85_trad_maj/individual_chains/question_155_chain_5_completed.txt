Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Hmm.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the variance, which is <P_z^2> minus <P_z> squared. So I need to calculate both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x, right? So, when I measure P_x, I'll get a definite value. But since the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, the uncertainty in P_z won't be zero. That makes sense.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that down. I'll call this vector |ψ>.

The P_x matrix is provided. Let me write it down again to make sure. It's a 3x3 matrix where the first row is (0, ℏ/√2, 0), the second row is (ℏ/√2, 0, ℏ/√2), and the third row is (0, ℏ/√2, 0). Similarly, P_y and P_z have their own matrices. But since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, maybe I don't need to worry about P_y or P_x for the uncertainty calculation except for the state.

Wait, actually, the uncertainty is about P_z, so maybe I can proceed using the state |ψ> and the P_z matrix.

The P_z matrix is diagonal: the first diagonal element is ℏ, the second is 0, and the third is -ℏ. So it looks like this:

[ [ℏ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ℏ] ]

Right. So, to find <P_z>, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Similarly, for <P_z²>, I compute ψ† P_z² ψ. But since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So, P_z² is:

[ [ℏ², 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, (ℏ)^2] ]

Wait, no, because (-ℏ)^2 is ℏ². So the diagonal elements are ℏ², 0, ℏ². So P_z squared is a diagonal matrix with entries [ℏ², 0, ℏ²].

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's compute P_z squared correctly. Each diagonal element is (value)^2. So the first element is (ℏ)^2 = ℏ², the second is 0^2=0, the third is (-ℏ)^2 = ℏ². So yes, P_z squared is [ [ℏ², 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0,ℏ²] ].

Okay, so to find <P_z>, I'll compute the expectation value. |ψ> is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So ψ is a column vector with three elements. To compute ψ† P_z ψ, I can do it as ψ^dagger multiplied by P_z multiplied by ψ.

Let me write |ψ> as a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/2 ]
        [ 1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

So ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Now, ψ† P_z ψ would be:

[ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by P_z matrix multiplied by |ψ>.

But since P_z is diagonal, the multiplication simplifies. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, P_z |ψ> would be:

For each component of |ψ>, multiply by the corresponding diagonal element.

So:

First component: ( -1/2 ) * ℏ
Second component: (1/√2 ) * 0 = 0
Third component: ( -1/2 ) * (-ℏ) = (1/2) ℏ

So P_z |ψ> = [ (-ℏ/2 ), 0, (ℏ/2) ]^T.

Then, ψ† (P_z |ψ> ) is the dot product of ψ† and this vector.

So, [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * [ -ℏ/2, 0, ℏ/2 ]

Calculating each term:

-1/2 * (-ℏ/2) = (ℏ/4)
1/√2 * 0 = 0
-1/2 * (ℏ/2) = - ℏ/4

Adding them up: (ℏ/4) + 0 + (-ℏ/4) = 0. So <P_z> is 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z in this state is zero.

Now, moving on to <P_z²>. Let's compute this. Again, since P_z squared is diagonal, P_z² |ψ> is:

First component: (-1/2) * ℏ²
Second component: (1/√2 ) * 0 = 0
Third component: (-1/2) * ℏ²

So P_z² |ψ> = [ (-1/2) ℏ², 0, (-1/2) ℏ² ]^T.

Then, ψ† (P_z² |ψ> ) is the dot product:

[ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * [ (-1/2) ℏ², 0, (-1/2) ℏ² ]

Calculating each term:

-1/2 * (-1/2 ℏ²) = (1/4) ℏ²
1/√2 * 0 = 0
-1/2 * (-1/2 ℏ²) = (1/4) ℏ²

Adding them up: (1/4 + 0 +1/4 ) ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ². So <P_z²> is (1/2) ℏ².

So the variance is <P_z²> - <P_z>^2 = (1/2) ℏ² - 0 = (1/2) ℏ².

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt( (1/2) ℏ² ) = (ℏ) * sqrt(1/2) )= ℏ / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B, which is ℏ/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

First, expectation of P_z was 0, as the positive and negative terms canceled. Then, the expectation of P_z squared was 1/2 ℏ². So the variance is 1/2 ℏ², sqrt of that is (ℏ)/√2.

Yes, that seems correct. So the uncertainty is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$, we first apply $P_z$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} (-\frac{1}{2})\hbar \\ 0 \\ (-\frac{1}{2})(-\hbar) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the dot product of $\langle \psi |$ with $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{4}, \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 = 0, \quad -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = -\frac{\hbar}{4}.
\]

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z^2$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} (-\frac{1}{2})\hbar^2 \\ 0 \\ (-\frac{1}{2})\hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute the dot product of $\langle \psi |$ with $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}, \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 = 0, \quad -\frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}.
\]

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty
The variance is:

\[
\text{Variance} = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
