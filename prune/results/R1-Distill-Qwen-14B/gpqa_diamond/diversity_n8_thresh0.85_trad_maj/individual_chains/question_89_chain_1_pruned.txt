Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, making product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, resulting in product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Hmm, I remember that when dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, elimination reactions can occur, leading to alkenes. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines opposite each other on the adamantane framework.

Heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of an alkene. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe it forms 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, or perhaps it's a more substituted double bond. Let me think, the product after elimination would be a diene? Or maybe a mono-ene, considering the starting material has two bromines.

Wait, the product 1's NMR is given. Let's look at the data. The 1H NMR spectrum shows:

4.79 ppm (2H), a triplet maybe?

Then 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), which are probably the adamantane carbons, maybe as methylene groups.

1.94 ppm (2H), perhaps another set of CH2 groups.

And the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if product 1 is from elimination of HBr, it's probably an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane plus KOH. Another possibility is that it's a diepoxide. No, wait, no, KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction? But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, if it's an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. So the product would be a diene, but wait, let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a triplet integrating to 2H. That sounds like a CH2 group adjacent to something. Maybe an epoxide? No, because an epoxide would have a different chemical shift. Or perhaps it's an ether? Or maybe it's a carbonyl group, but wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but the product of elimination would be an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is not elimination. Another possibility is that KOH could induce a substitution. Wait, but substitution of two bromines in 1,3-dibromoadamantane would require a two-step process. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH give a carbonyl?

Oh, wait a second! Maybe it's a Hofmann rearrangement? Or something else. Alternatively, maybe the bromides are oxidized? No, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another possibility is that KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution to form an epoxide. No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromides undergo elimination to form a carbonyl via a double elimination. Oh, wait! When you have vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), elimination can form an alkene. But if they're on opposite ends, maybe it's forming a ketone via some mechanism. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an E2 elimination, where two HBr molecules are removed, leading to a double bond. But that would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So why is there a carbonyl in the IR?

Hmm, maybe the product isn't from elimination but from something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but in the structure of adamantane, 1 and 3 positions are
