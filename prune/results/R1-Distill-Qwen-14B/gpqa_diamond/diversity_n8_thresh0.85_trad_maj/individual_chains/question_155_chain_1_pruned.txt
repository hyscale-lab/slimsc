Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. Alright, let me start by breaking down what's given.

First, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which is important because that means the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. So when I calculate expectation values, I don't have to worry about changing the basis unless needed.

The uncertainty in P_z is given by the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute both ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but since the state is given as a vector, maybe I can compute these expectation values directly from the matrix of P_z. Let me check the matrix for P_z.

The P_z matrix is given as:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means each basis vector corresponds to one of these eigenvalues.

The state vector is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. 

First, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Since P_z is diagonal, matrix multiplication might be straightforward. Let me write this out.

⟨ψ| is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Multiplying ⟨ψ| by P_z gives:
[ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ) ] → [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Then, multiplying this by |ψ⟩:
( -ħ/2 )*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/2)*(-1/2)

Wait, let's compute each term:
First term: (-ħ/2) * (-1/2) = (ħ/4)
Second term: 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third term: (ħ/2) * (-1/2) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's convenient.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is (P_z)^2, which for a diagonal matrix squares each diagonal element. So the matrix of P_z² would be:
Row1: (ħ², 0, 0)
Row2: (0, 0, 0)
Row3: (0, 0, ħ²)

Wait, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ², right. So P_z^2 is a diagonal matrix with ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Again, since P_z² is diagonal, the multiplication should be straightforward.

Compute ⟨ψ| P_z²:
[ (-1/2) * ħ², (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*ħ² ]

Which is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Now multiply this by |ψ⟩:
[ (-ħ²/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ²/2)*(-1/2) ]

Each term:
First term: (ħ²/2)*(1/2) = ħ²/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (ħ²/2)*(1/2) = ħ²/4

Total: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, putting it all into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 )
Which is sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check everything because sometimes I get confused with the signs. Oh wait, no, I think that's correct. The state's expectation for P_z is zero, so the variance depends only on the expectation of P_z squared.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ / sqrt(
