Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. Hmm, it's about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. 

Wait, the equation given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh right, that's pi plus decaying into a muon plus and a neutrino. So since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the products must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, the neutrino is a lepton, so it's pretty light, almost massless compared to the muon. I remember that the muon is like 105.7 MeV/c², and the pion is 139.6 MeV/c².

So, the rest masses are given: m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's mass is negligible, so we can approximate it as zero. 

I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Let me think about the energy. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. So, the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino.

So, energy conservation: m_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu. And momentum conservation: since the pion is not moving, the total momentum must be zero. So, the magnitude of the muon's momentum p must equal the neutrino's momentum p, but their directions are opposite. 

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = |p| c, because its rest mass is zero (E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, so when m=0, E=pc).

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

So, putting it all together, m_pi c^2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c.

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of p. Let me write that out without the c^2 terms to simplify. Let me set c=1 for units, so the equation becomes:

m_pi = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) + p.

Let me denote m_pi = M, m_mu = m. So, M = sqrt(p² + m²) + p.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p. Let's subtract p from both sides:

M - p = sqrt(p² + m²).

Now, square both sides:

(M - p)^2 = p² + m².

Expanding the left side: M² - 2 M p + p² = p² + m².

Subtract p² from both sides:

M² - 2 M p = m².

Move the terms around:

-2 M p = m² - M².

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 M p = M² - m².

So, p = (M² - m²)/(2 M).

Let me plug in the numbers. M is 139.6 MeV, m is 105.7 MeV.

Calculating M²: (139.6)^2 ≈ let's see, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6^2 is a bit less. Let me compute 139.6 *139.6.

139.6 * 139.6: 140 *140 = 19600. Subtract 0.4*2*140 + 0.4^2.

Wait, maybe a calculator approach would be better. Let me compute 139.6^2:

= (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140
