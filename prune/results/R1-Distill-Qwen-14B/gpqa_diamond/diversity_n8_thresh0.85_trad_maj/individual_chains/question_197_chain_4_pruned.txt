Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X has certain IR and NMR data and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Oh wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI might be involved in a different reaction. Oh right, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester or a nitrile? Or perhaps the HI is acting as a source of iodide in some substitution reaction. Wait, another thought: red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. No, wait, nitriles under such conditions give amines, but maybe under different conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's about the Cleve reaction or something else.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out what Compound X is based on the spectral data given. Once I know what X is, I can determine what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

So, let's look at the IR data first. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or an aromatic ketone? Or maybe a carboxylic acid derivative. Let me think.

The 1H NMR data is next. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. That's probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700, but maybe it's a bit higher if it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but the 10.5 ppm is more for a carboxylic acid or an enol.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which
