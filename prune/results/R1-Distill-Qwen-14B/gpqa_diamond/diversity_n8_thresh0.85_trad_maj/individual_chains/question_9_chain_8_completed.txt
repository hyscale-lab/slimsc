Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry, but I need to think about what that exactly means. 

Wait, symmetry operations... right. The C3h point group is one of the axial groups. So what does C3h include? I think it's a combination of a three-fold rotation (C3) and a mirror plane (σh) that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. So for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it should have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that includes that axis.

Let me look at the options given. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I'm a bit rusty on some of these structures, so I'll try to visualize each one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Wait, I think that's (i-PrO)3B. Borate with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a substituent. So does this molecule have C3h symmetry? Let me think. The molecule around the boron atom would have three identical groups attached. So it's trigonal pyramidal? Or maybe trigonal planar? Wait, no, the boron is in the center with three O's attached, each from an isopropyl group. So the structure would have three identical substituents around B. So maybe it's symmetric with a three-fold axis.

But wait, what's the symmetry. Three identical groups would have a C3 axis, but for C3h, we need a mirror plane as well. So if the molecule is trigonal planar, maybe. Alternatively, a trigonal pyramidal would have a C3 axis but not a mirror plane. Wait, no, a trigonal planar molecule would have a C3 axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. So for example, if the substituents are all the same and arranged in a trigonal planar, then yes, it would have C3h symmetry. So triisopropyl borate might have that. But wait, each isopropyl group is -O- attached to the boron. So maybe it's trigonal planar with three identical substituents. So that would have C3h symmetry. So C could be a candidate.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, right? It's a norbornane derivative with an amine group. The structure looks like a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with an NH at one position. The symmetry of quinuclidine... I think it has a certain symmetry. Wait, norbornane itself has a plane of symmetry. Does quinuclidine have that? Well, the molecule is not symmetric in the same way as, say, cyclopropane. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure. Let me think: the molecule has a five-membered bridge, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Maybe it has a C2 axis or some other symmetry. I don't recall quinuclidine having a C3h symmetry. Probably not, since its structure isn't based on three-fold symmetry elements. So D is probably not the answer.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, benzo with a trifuran system. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Benzo suggests a benzene ring, and the rest is a trifuran system. Oh wait, benzo is a substituent on the trifuran. Let me try to sketch it. The trifuran would have three oxygen atoms in a ring, each connected to a benzene ring. Wait, actually, the benzo part is fused. So this molecule might have a bicyclic structure with three benzene rings attached? No, wait, the notation is [1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c''], which probably means that each oxygen is connected to a benzene ring in a particular way. Alternatively, it's a tricyclic structure where each of the three positions on the central ring is connected to a benzene. So each oxygen is part of a benzofuran ring. So perhaps each of the three positions has a benzene ring fused to it. So the structure would have three benzene rings attached to a central furan ring. 

Now, considering symmetry. Each of the three benzene rings would be attached in a symmetric fashion. So the central ring (trifuran) might be symmetric. Wait, each benzene is attached in a way that they are arranged symmetrically around the central ring. If the three substituents (benzene rings) are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule could have a three-fold axis. But then, would it also have a mirror plane? For C3h, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. So if the three substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, then yes, C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the substituents here are not atoms but rings. So, perhaps the arrangement allows for a mirror plane. So if the three benzene rings are each attached to the central ring in such a way that they are symmetrically placed 120 degrees apart around a central axis, then the molecule would have a three-fold rotation symmetry and a mirror plane. So that would make C3h symmetry. So is that the case for option B? The name suggests that each benzene is attached in positions 1,2-c, 3,4-c', etc. Not entirely sure about the exact structure, but if all three are attached symmetrically, then option B could have C3h.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Similar to option B, but the substituents are phenyl groups, perhaps. So the central ring is a trifuran, and each position is connected to a phenyl group. So again, if the three phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically at 120 degrees around the central ring, then the molecule would have three-fold symmetry. Plus, a mirror plane would imply C3h.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the actual structures. Let me think about each.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. So the molecule should have a trigonal planar structure. Trigonal planar has a C3 rotation axis and a plane of symmetry perpendicular to it, which would make it C3h. So that would qualify.

But wait, is the structure trigonal planar? Boron usually has a trigonal planar geometry when it's bonded to three atoms. In this case, it's bonded to three oxygen atoms (from the isopropyl groups). So the geometry around B is trigonal planar. So yes, that structure would have C3h symmetry. Because each substituent is the same, and the arrangement is symmetric.

So that brings us to the options. The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. If option C (triisopropyl borate) has a trigonal planar structure, then it would have C3h symmetry. But wait, another thing: in a trigonal planar structure, the mirror plane is present, so yes, it fits.

But wait, some molecules with trigonal planar structures might not have a mirror plane, but in this case, since all three substituents are identical, I think the molecule would have a mirror plane. Because for each position, flipping across the plane would map the molecule onto itself. So for each substituent, there's a mirror image.

Alternatively, if the three substituents are arranged in a trigonal pyramidal shape, that would have a C3 axis but no mirror plane, leading to C3v symmetry instead of C3h. But in this case, the geometry is trigonal planar, which would have both a C3 axis and a σh plane.

So triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry. So option C would be the correct answer.

Now, looking back at the options and the choices:

Options are A, B, C, D.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure about the other options. Option D is quinuclidine. Its structure is a bicyclic amine. I think it has a plane of symmetry, maybe a C2 axis. So it's more likely to belong to a different point group, maybe C2h or something else, but not C3h.

Option B is benzo[...]. If the substituents are symmetrically arranged, then yes, but I think in this case, benzo is attached to three positions, but maybe not in a way that allows for C3h. Alternatively, maybe option A has three phenyl groups attached in a symmetric way.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the substituents in options B and A are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for a three-fold rotation. For instance, if they're attached in a way that the molecule isn't three-fold symmetric. Or perhaps they're attached in a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. I'm getting a bit confused now. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So let me think about each option's structure again.

Triisopropyl borate (C): trigonal planar, three identical substituents. So yes, C3h.

Quinuclidine (D): bicyclic, probably has a C2 axis and a mirror plane, so maybe C2v or C2h.

Benzo[...] trifuran (B): three benzene rings attached symmetrically. If all three are attached at 120 degrees, then yes, C3h. Similarly for option A, which has phenyl groups attached.

Wait, but how do those substituents affect the symmetry? Suppose each substituent is the same, like all benzene rings, and arranged symmetrically. Then yes, C3h would apply.

So how do I differentiate between options B and C?

Wait, perhaps the other options don't have all substituents identical. Let me read the names again.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So the substituents are benzene rings fused to each of the three positions.

Option A is triphenyleno... So each substituent is a phenyl group, not fused but attached as substituents.

But in any case, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate (C) is a much simpler structure. Three identical substituents on a trigonal planar central atom, so that's definitely C3h.

So perhaps the correct answer is C. But wait, the question says "which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry?".

Wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when substituents are rings, the symmetry can be different. Maybe in the case of the triphenylborate, it's not planar. Boron is in the center with three isopropyl groups. Wait, each isopropyl group is O-connected. So the structure is O-Pr2C-O-B-O-Pr2C-O-Pr2C-O-.

Wait, no, triisopropyl borate is O-Pr2C-B(O-Pr2C)3? Or is it (i-PrO)3B. So each oxygen is attached to two isopropyl groups? Or wait, no. The structure should be O-Pr2C-O-B-O-Pr2C-O-Pr2C-O-? No, that wouldn't make sense. Wait, no, the formula for triisopropyl borate is (i-PrO)3B, which is B(O-Pr2C)3. So each oxygen is connected to the boron and to two isopropyl groups? No, wait, each isopropyl group is a substituent on the oxygen. So each oxygen is bonded to B and to two CH(CH2CH3) groups. No, wait, no: an isopropyl group is (CH2)2CH-, but in the borate, the oxygen is connected to the boron and to two isopropyl groups? Hmm, no. Wait, each oxygen is attached to the boron and to an isopropyl group. So each O is connected to one isopropyl group and to B. So each O is connected to B and an isopropyl group, right? So each O is -O-O-Pr2CH? No, each O is O-Pr2CH2? No, wait, isopropyl is (CH2)2CH-, but in this case, the borate is (i-PrO)3B. So each oxygen is connected to the boron and to an isopropyl group. So each oxygen is part of an isopropyl group: O connected to B and two CH2 groups, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the geometry is trigonal planar, so that would have C3h. So I think option C is the correct answer.

But then why is the question giving options A and B with more complex structures? Maybe they also have C3h symmetry. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think again: triphenyleno...trifuran. So each of the three positions on the trifuran is connected to a phenyl group. If those are arranged symmetrically, then yes. But if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane, perhaps not. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, then yes.

But I think that triisopropyl borate is a straightforward case with C3h symmetry because of its trigonal planar structure. So the answer must be C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached symmetrically. If the phenyl groups are arranged at 120° intervals around the central trifuran ring, the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, for **C₃h** symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) must also be present. The arrangement of the phenyl groups does not clearly indicate the presence of such a mirror plane, so this molecule likely does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule has a trifuran core with three benzene rings fused to it. The fused benzene rings are arranged symmetrically around the central trifuran ring. While the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), the fused benzene rings disrupt the symmetry required for a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, this molecule does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom at the center, bonded to three identical isopropyl groups via oxygen atoms. The molecule adopts a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals. This structure has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the rotation axis, fulfilling the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry. Thus, this molecule exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with a norbornane-like structure. It has a plane of symmetry but does not possess a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry with three identical substituents and the presence of both a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).

Answer: C
