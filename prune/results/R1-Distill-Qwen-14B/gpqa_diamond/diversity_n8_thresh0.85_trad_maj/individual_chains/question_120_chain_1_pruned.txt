Okay, so I've got this question about stars and how their number changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So that means their density is the same everywhere. I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. Oh right, because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, if I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But since we're dealing with parallax, which relates to distance, I need to think about how volume relates to parallax.

Wait, the volume depends on distance. For a given distance, the volume around that point is a sphere. But since the number is per unit range of plx, maybe I should think in terms of plx intervals.

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πd³. But since we're considering a thin shell (like a small change in distance), the volume would be the surface area multiplied by the thickness. Oh wait, but in this case, we're considering a small change in parallax, which corresponds to a small change in distance. So perhaps I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let's see, the distance d is 1/plx. Let's consider a small change in plx, dplx. The corresponding change in distance is dd = d(1/plx) = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx. The number density n is constant. The volume of this shell would be the area at distance d multiplied by the thickness. The area is 4πd². The thickness in terms of distance is dd, but I need to express dd in terms of dplx.

So, d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. Differentiating both sides, dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dplx. Since the negative sign just indicates direction, for the volume, I can take absolute values, so dd = (1/(plx²)) dplx.

Wait, no, because d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. So dd = (dplx) * (d/(1))². Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Let me compute dd in terms of dplx. So, d = 1/plx → d = (plx)^-1. Differentiating both sides with respect to plx: dd/dplx = - (plx)^-2 → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're considering a small positive change in plx, the negative
