Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the orbital inclination relative to our line of sight. But wait, how exactly does that probability work? I think the probability is related to the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Oh right, the transit probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a), where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. Oh yeah, the probability P is about (R_star / a) multiplied by some function of the orbital eccentricity. But since both planets have circular orbits, the eccentricity is zero, so that term would be 1. So P â‰ˆ (R_star) / (a).

But wait, wait. Wait, isn't the probability also related to the size of the planet? Oh, no, the question is about the probability of the planet transiting, not the depth of the transit. So I don't think the planet's size comes into play here. So I can ignore the planet radius for this probability calculation.

So the main factors are R_star and a. But wait, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(
