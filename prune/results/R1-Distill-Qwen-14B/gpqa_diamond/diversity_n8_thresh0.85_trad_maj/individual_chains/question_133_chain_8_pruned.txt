Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-? Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates. Hmm, wait, the phosphate ions can be in different forms based on pH. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Or wait, maybe orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, but I think in this context, since we're dealing with salts, it's more about the species in solution.

The problem gives the molecular weights: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Temperature is 25°C, so we can use standard conditions for activity coefficients, which probably are close to 1, so we can ignore activity for this problem.

The Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, and it dissociates in three steps.

So, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Wait, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, so that would be PO4^3-? Or is orthophosphate the HPO4^2- form? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (di-hydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), then PO4^3- (phosphate). So orthophosphate ions in solution could refer to HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Or maybe the question is about the total concentration of all phosphate species?

Wait, the question says "orthophosphate ions," which I think refers to the HPO4^2- or maybe the sum. But I'm not too sure. Let me set that aside for now and think about the bigger picture.

The solution contains two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Each of these will dissolve and dissociate in water. Let's consider each salt.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So the formula would be KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4, so each formula unit gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-).

So, in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Also, since we have both the hydrogen phosphate and the hydrogen phosphate in solution, this is a buffer solution. Because the solution contains a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2- (since H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-). So, the buffer system is H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- with the pKa corresponding to the second dissociation of H3PO4, right? Because H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1), then H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3).

So,
