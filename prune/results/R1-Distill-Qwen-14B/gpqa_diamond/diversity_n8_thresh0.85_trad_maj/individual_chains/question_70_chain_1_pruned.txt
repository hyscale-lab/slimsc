Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's parse the reactions given. The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of E, which is one of the products.

Starting with the first reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I'm thinking, what common compounds react with each other in such a ratio? 8 equivalents is a lot, so maybe it's something like a metal reacting with oxygen, but oxygen is O2, and 8 would imply something like O8, which I don't think exists. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where a metal oxide forms, but the ratio of 8 is throwing me off.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a diatomic gas. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of O2 reacting. But then, what solid A would react with O2 to give a bright red product C? Oh, wait! Copper reacts with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide, which is black, not red. Iron can form ferric oxide, which is reddish, but I'm not sure about the exact color. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is sulfur, and B is oxygen. Sulfur reacting with oxygen gives SO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving a transition metal that forms a red compound. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a sulfide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the product C is bright red, which makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate, but that's blue. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound, but chromium(III) oxide is black. Wait, another thought: perhaps C is lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Oh, or maybe it's a manganese compound? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product C is a nitride or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me look for other clues.

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. The fact that E is extremely hazardous suggests it might be something like a nerve agent, or perhaps something highly toxic like HCN or something else. Wait, but D is a gas, so maybe D is H2S or another gas.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. If F is a strong acid, maybe it's H2SO4 or HCl. G is a weak acid, perhaps acetic acid or something like that.

Wait, if C is reacting with water to produce two acids, then perhaps C is a salt. Like, maybe a metal sulfite reacting with water. Alternatively, C could be a metal carbonate, which upon hydrolysis gives a metal oxide (forming A), CO2, and water. But then, that would produce maybe a strong acid if the metal is from a group that forms strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, which reacts with water to form NH3 and a strong acid like HNO3. Wait, but that would require a metal nitride.

Wait, let's think about the hydrolysis reaction. If C is something like a metal oxide, then reacting with water might give a metal hydroxide, but that doesn't produce acids. Unless it's a non-metal oxide. For example, if C is a sulfide (like CuS), but that's more of a solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfate, which upon hydrolysis gives the metal oxide and sulfuric acid. But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a mixed oxide. For example, if it's a sulfite, which upon reaction with water gives the acid. But I'm not getting it right now.

Let's go back to the first reaction. If A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C, maybe A is a metal, B is a halogen, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2. So, for example, if A is iron, and B is O2, then 4 moles of O2 would be needed for FeO (FeO has formula Fe:O ratio 1:1). Wait, but 8 B would be 8 moles, so perhaps 4 O2 molecules (since each O2 is 1 molecule but contributes two O atoms). Hmm, maybe it's more about the stoichiometry.

Wait, 8 equivalents of B. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles. So, if A is a metal M, the reaction could be M + 8 O2 → M O4 or something. Wait, what metals form such oxides? Let's think: M could be lead. Lead(IV) oxide is PbO2, which is dark brown. Not red. Alternatively, maybe vanadium pentoxide is V2O5, which is orange. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product C, when reacted with D, gives E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H, a solvent. Solvents could be something like ethanol, methanol, or maybe water. Wait, but D and B are gases. So, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H could be H2O, which is a solvent. But that's a possibility.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then their reaction would produce H2O. But H2 and O2
