Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Wait, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right! That's o-bromobenzene, but wait, 2-d maybe refers to a deuterated compound? Like, perhaps the benzene ring has a deuterium somewhere else. Hmm, but the main point is the structureâ€”so maybe it's para or meta, but wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the molecule is bromobenzene with the bromine in the ortho position relative to another substituent. Wait, but the way it's written, 1-bromo-2-d benzene, which would be o-bromobenzene with a deuterium in position 2. Or perhaps it's more accurately called o-bromobenzene-d2? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed.

So the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. When you have a benzene ring with a substituent, the base can abstract a proton in certain positions, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then reacts.

Wait, but bromobenzene is typically a meta director. Oh, but in this case, maybe the reaction is about elimination or forming a benzyn intermediate? Or perhaps it's a benzyne synthesis.

Wait, another thought: When you have a dihalobenzene and treat it with a strong base, like NaNH2, you can get elimination to form a triple bond, creating a benzyne intermediate. But wait, in this case, the molecule is mono-bromobenzene. So maybe that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the reaction is about dehydrohalogenation. So, if we have a bromide on the benzene ring, and a hydrogen adjacent to it, the base could abstract that hydrogen, leading to a double bond. But wait, benzene rings are already conjugated, so would that form a triple bond? Or am I mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the benzene ring has a Br at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. Or perhaps it's a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and another substituent (maybe a hydrogen replaced by D) at position 2. Wait, but wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which suggests the bromine is at position 1, and position 2 is deuterated. So the structure is Br attached to C1, and D attached to C2.

Now, when we treat this with NaNH2 in ammonia. I think NaNH2 is a strong base, so it's likely to abstract a proton. But wait, in this compound, the hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by deuterium. So the adjacent position (C2) to Br has a D, not H. So the neighboring position to Br (C2) is D, which doesn't react as easily as H. So the base can't abstract a proton from C2 because it's a D. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, so the structure is Br on C1, D on C2. Then, the adjacent positions are C2 (D) and C6 (if the numbering is such). So the positions available for H are C3, C4, C5, and C6. Wait, no, the positions adjacent to Br (ortho positions) are C2 and C6. But C2 is already D, so the other position is C6. So, the only H in the ortho position is on C6.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's draw this out mentally. Benzene ring with Br at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 are ortho to Br. Position 2 has D, so position 6 is H. So the H at position 6 is adjacent to Br and could be abstracted by the base NaNH2.

So when the base abstracts the H from C6, what happens? That would form a carbanion adjacent to the Br, right? Wait, but in aromatic chemistry, when a base abstracts a proton adjacent to a substituent like Br, it can lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which can then undergo elimination.

Wait, but in this case, since the Br is in position 1 and the H is in position 6, which is ortho. So after deprotonation, we'd have a negative charge on C6. But wait, benzene's aromaticity requires six pi electrons. If we deprotonate, we're taking away an H+, leaving a negative charge. Alternatively, maybe it's more about forming a triple bond. Oh wait, wait, perhaps this is a case for forming a benzyn intermediate.

Wait, benzyn is a diradical or a triple bond between two carbons on the benzene ring. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination where Br and a H are removed, forming a triple bond. But wait, in this case, we have Br on C1, and H on C6. So removing H from C6 would result in a triple bond between C1 and C2? But wait, C2 is D, not H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of elimination. The base could abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne) and the loss of HBr.

Wait, but if we have Br on C1 and H on C6 (ortho), then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2? But wait, C2 is D, not H. So perhaps that's not possible. Wait, no, because the D is on C2, so perhaps the H is on C6. So eliminating H from C6 and Br from C1 would form a triple bond between C1 and C2? Hmm, but C2 is D, not H. Wait, that complicates elimination because you can't eliminate DBr, can you? Or is DBr a possibility?

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. Wait, but bromobenzene is not very reactive towards substitution under normal conditions. However, if we have a strong base, perhaps the mechanism is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzyl anion. Wait, but in this case, the structure is a benzene ring, so perhaps it's more about forming a substituted benzene with a negative charge, which could then undergo further reactions.

Wait, but considering the possibility of forming a benzyn intermediate, the reaction conditions (strong base, like NaNH2 in ammonia) are known to promote elimination to form benzyne. So in the case of 1-bromo-2-d benzene, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from the position adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a triple bond, but since the adjacent position is D, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure again. If the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, that's bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, position 6 is H.

So the base NaNH2 would abstract the H from position 6. That would create a carbanion at position 6. But wait, can that carbanion then eliminate the Br, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? Wait, no, because the positions involved in the triple bond have to be adjacent, right? So if the base takes H from position 6, adjacent to position 1 (Br), then elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? But wait, that's para positions, which are not adjacent. So that can't form a triple bond because triple bonds are between adjacent carbons. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 1 is next to 2 and 6. So position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So H is on position 6. So when the base abstracts the H from position 6, adjacent to Br on position 1, then elimination of HBr would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? But that's para positions, which aren't adjacent. Oh wait, that can't form a triple bond because triple bonds require adjacent carbons. So perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, then what's happening here? If the base can't abstract a hydrogen from position 6 because it's not adjacent to Br in a way that would allow elimination, then maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as expected. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me try drawing it. Imagine benzene ring:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So, Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 (D) and 6 (H). So when NaNH2 is added, it will abstract the H from position 6 because that's the only available H adjacent to Br.

So abstracting H from 6 gives a negative charge at 6. Now, maybe this can lose Br-, but wait, how? Because to eliminate, you need to have Br and H on adjacent carbons, right?

Wait, wait, elimination would require the H and Br to be on adjacent carbons. So H is on 6, Br on 1, but 6 is adjacent to 1 (since benzene is a ring, 1 and 6 are adjacent). So yes, elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, creating a triple bond in the ring. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, which are adjacent. Oh wait, yes! So when the base abstracts the H from 6, adjacent to Br on 1, then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6. But wait, but then the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, which are adjacent, making a triple bond in the benzene ring, which would create a benzyne intermediate.

So the product would be benzyne, but in this case, since the ring is deuterated at position 2, how does that affect the reaction? Do we get a different product?

Wait, but the problem is about the number of possible organic products. So, when benzyne is formed, what happens? Benzyne can undergo various reactions, but in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia. I'm not sure if the benzyne would dimerize or react further.

Wait, but in the presence of NaNH2 and NH3, maybe the benzyne would undergo some kind of coupling reaction, like a Diels-Alder or something else, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction stops at the benzyne stage.

Wait, but if the reaction forms benzyne, is that considered a product? Or does it form other products?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne because of the deuterium. Wait, the H that's abstracted is at position 6. If it's a normal H, the reaction would proceed as usual, but if the H is replaced by D, perhaps the reaction is slower or doesn't proceed as easily. But in this case, the H is at position 6, which is abstracted by the base, so the presence of D at position 2 shouldn't affect that.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the Br is on C1, D on C2, and H on C6. The base abstracts H from C6, leading to the formation of benzyne (triple bond between C1 and C6). So how many possible products are formed?

Wait, but benzyne can rearrange, perhaps? Or is there more than one possible structure? Or maybe the formation of benzyne leads to a diradical, which could form different products when quenched.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne because of the position of the deuterium. Wait, but the D is on C2, which is not involved in the elimination. So it shouldn't affect the formation of benzyne.

Wait, but in this scenario, the reaction would form benzyne, which is a single product. So the number of organic products would be one. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, which is a single isomer. So when the reaction proceeds to form benzyne, perhaps that's the only product.

Wait, but when the benzyne is formed, does it immediately undergo some reaction in the solvent? Because NaNH2 is a strong base, but the solvent is ammonia, which is aprotic. So perhaps the benzyne could dimerize, but I'm not certain if that's the case under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions don't favor further reactions beyond the formation of the benzyne. So the main product is the benzyne intermediate. But benzyne itself is a transient intermediate, so perhaps the question is about possible products, not the intermediates. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible elimination products. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, then the base could abstract H only from position 6, leading to the formation of benzyne. So that's the only product. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is one.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the H at position 6 is not acidic enough. But I think in aromatic rings, especially with an electron-withdrawing group like Br, the adjacent protons are more acidic, making them abstractable by a strong base like NaNH2.

So, putting it all together, the reaction abstracts the H from position 6, leading to the formation of benzyne, which is a single product. Thus, the answer should be option B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. The compound 1-bromobenzene-2-d has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2 on the benzene ring. The base NaNH2 is a strong base that can abstract protons (or deuterium, in some cases) from positions adjacent to the bromine.

In this case, the bromine atom at position 1 is ortho to position 2 (which is deuterated) and position 6 (which has a hydrogen). Since the hydrogen at position 6 is the only available proton adjacent to the bromine, NaNH2 will abstract this hydrogen. This deprotonation leads to the formation of a carbanion at position 6, which then eliminates the bromine atom to form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in the formation of a benzyne intermediate.

The benzyne intermediate is a highly reactive species, but under the given reaction conditions (NaNH2 in condensed ammonia), no further reactions are likely to occur. The starting material is a single isomer (1-bromobenzene-2-d), and the reaction proceeds to form only one product, benzyne. Therefore, the number of possible organic products in this reaction is 1.

Answer: B
