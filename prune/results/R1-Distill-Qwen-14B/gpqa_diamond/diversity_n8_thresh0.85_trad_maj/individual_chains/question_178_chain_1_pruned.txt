Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term's dimension should be [mass]^4 to make the integral over four dimensions (which has [mass]^−4) give a dimensionless quantity.

Wait, actually, each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 because when you multiply by the volume element (which has dimension [mass]^−4), the integral gives something with dimension 0. So each term in L must be [mass]^4.

So I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Let's break down each part of the term.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, and then F^{μν}. Let me find the dimensions of each part.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order, so each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (the adjoint) also has 3/2.

σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, I think. Because when you raise and lower indices with the metric, which has dimension 0 (since it's a tensor), but wait, no, the metric g_{μν} is dimensionless in natural units where c=ħ=1. So the commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] must be dimensionless as well. So σ_{mu nu} has the same dimension as i times the commutator, which is dimensionless. So σ is dimensionless. So the σ part doesn't contribute to the mass dimension.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor of a gauge field. Wait, but wait, in the given Lagrangian, F is written as F^{mu nu}, which is for a gauge field like electromagnetism. The field strength F has dimensions. Let me recall: the field tensor F_{mu nu} for electromagnetism is the derivative of A, so each derivative brings a mass dimension of 1. So F^{mu nu} would have dimension 2, since each derivative is [mass]^1, and F is second derivatives of A.

Wait, no. Wait, A_mu has a dimension. Let me think. In four dimensions, the gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term is (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ)^2, and each ∂ is [mass]^1, so each A has to have dimension 1. So F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so dimension of 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait no, wait, ∂_mu is [mass]^1, and A is dimension 1, so F is [mass]^1 * [A], which is [mass]^2.

So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Putting this together: the term is κ * (ψ̄) * σ_{mu nu} * ψ * F^{mu nu}.

Each part's dimensions:

ψ̄: 3/2
ψ: 3/2
F: 2
κ: ?

And σ is dimensionless. So the product would be:

κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, let me compute that. 3/2 * 3/2 is 9/4, multiplied by 2 is 9/2. So the total dimension from the fields is 9/2.

Wait, no. Wait, ψ̄ and ψ are both 3/2 each, so their product is 3. Because 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then multiply by F which is 2: 3 * 2 = 6. So the total dimension from the fields (excluding κ) is 6.

Wait, that's not right. Because ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, so the product ψ̄ ψ is 3. Then multiply by F (dimension 2): 3 * 2 =6. So the entire term is κ multiplied by something with dimension 6. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So κ * [6] = 4. So [κ] = 4 /6 = 2/3? Wait, that can't be right because the answer options are -1 or 1.

Wait, I must have messed up. Let me try again.

Wait, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension [mass]^4. So the whole term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4.

Breaking down each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.

ψ has 3/2.

F has dimension 2.

σ is dimensionless, so no contribution.

So the product is:

κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = κ * (9/4 * 2) = κ * (9/2).

Wait, 3/2 *3/2 is 9/4. 9/4 * 2 is 9/2 * (2/2) = 9/2? Wait, 9/4 *2 is (9*2)/(4) = 18/4 =9/2.

So κ * (9/2) = 4 (since the term must have dimension 4).

So κ must have dimension (4) / (9/2) )= (4 *2)/9 = 8/9. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. The options have κ with dimension -1 or 1.

Wait, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the dimensions.

Let me double-check the dimensions.

So, ψ is a Dirac spinor. In four dimensions, the Dirac field has dimension (d-1)/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. So for d=4, (4-1)/2=3/2. So ψ has dimension 3/2. Correct.

F^{mu
