Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm. Right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the measurements found the particles between x=1 and x=3, that must mean the wave function is zero outside this region, but wait no, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that's the wave function in the region where the particle can exist. So maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3? Or perhaps the given wave function is valid only between 1 and 3?

Wait, the question says the wave function is valid in a part of space where it can exist, and when you measure, the particles are found only between 1 and 3. So that suggests that the wave function outside of 1<x<3 is zero. Because the wave function given is only applicable in that region.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Because when they measure, all the particles are between 1 and 3, which implies that the wave function is non-zero only there.

So to find 'a', we need to normalize the wave function. Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, because the real and imaginary parts are squared and added. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let's compute this integral. Break it into two parts: integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

First part: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2)=ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to this value.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the wave function? Because the question says the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So ψ is a complex function. So when I compute |ψ|², it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2?
