Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. So in a vacuum, the lower the pressure, the longer the mean free path because there are fewer gas molecules to bump into.

Mike designed a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules so the electron beam isn't scattered too much. But some gas particles are still there, as detected by the mass spec.

He determined the mean free path λ1 based on factors like volume, pressure, and temperature. Then when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that factor doesn't change.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, right! When the electron beam is active, especially at high voltages like 1000 kV, it can cause various effects. One thing that comes to mind is that the beam produces X-rays when it interacts with the sample or the chamber walls. These X-rays might cause gas molecules to ionize. Ionized gas molecules would have an electric charge.

Charged particles, like ions, interact more strongly with the electron beam than neutral ones. So if the gas molecules are ionized, their cross-sectional area for scattering (or collision) would increase. That would mean the mean free path decreases because they collide more often. Because if the cross-section is larger, the probability of a collision goes up, so the average distance between collisions (the mean free path) would be shorter.

Alternatively, could the electron beam cause the gas to heat up? But the question says the temperature remained the same, so probably not. So the main effect would be ionization increasing the cross-section.

So the mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1 because the gas molecules are more likely to scatter due to being ionized. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but I should think about the mean free path formula. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of the gas, and σ is the collision cross-section. If the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize, then σ increases because charged particles have more ways to interact (like Coulomb interactions). So n might stay the same (since pressure and temperature are same, but wait, the beam might cause some gas to be pumped out or change the pressure? Not sure. The question says the temperature is same, and the initial λ1 is based on those factors. But when the beam is on, perhaps the pressure actually changes a bit because of the beam's effects, but the question seems to imply that the chamber's condition is same otherwise. Alternatively, the pressure is still the same, but the collision cross-section has changed because of ionization.

If σ increases, 1/(nσ) would decrease, so λ decreases. So yes, λ2 < λ1. So the answer is C.


The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum is determined by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma}
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of the gas molecules, and \( \sigma \) is the collision cross-section. Initially, Mike determined the mean free path as \( \lambda_1 \) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10\(^{-9}\) Torr), where the pressure, temperature, and sample compartment volume were considered.

When the electron beam is activated, the high voltage (1000 kV) causes interactions between the beam and the residual gas molecules. These interactions can lead to ionization of the gas molecules. Ionized gas molecules acquire an electric charge, which increases their collision cross-section (\( \sigma \)) due to enhanced Coulomb interactions. Since \( \sigma \) increases, the mean free path decreases, even though the pressure and temperature remain the same. This results in a new mean free path \( \lambda_2 \), where \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

Given the options, the correct conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 \) is less than \( \lambda_1 \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
