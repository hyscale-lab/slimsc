Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) muon and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. I'm given the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, and the neutrino's mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So I can probably ignore it in calculations.

The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options give pairs of values, so I guess one is for the muon and the other for the neutrino. But wait, neutrinos are leptons too, but they’re hard to detect because they interact so weakly. But in terms of energy, since their rest mass is almost zero, their kinetic energy would just be their total energy.

But wait, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum must still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But the neutrino's mass is negligible, so its momentum would be higher. Hmm, not sure if that's directly useful yet.

I remember that in decay problems where the parent is at rest, we can use conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think about the energies involved.

The rest energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the rest energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest energy is zero (since mass is negligible). So the total rest energy after decay is 105.7 + 0 = 105.7 MeV. But the pion had 139.6 MeV of rest energy, so the difference must be the kinetic energy released, right?

Wait, no. Because energy isn't just rest mass. The particles are moving, so their total energy includes kinetic energy plus rest energy. Oh right, so the total energy after decay would be the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's total energy.

Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy: 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the muon's and neutrino's energies must equal that.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu is the muon's rest energy plus its kinetic energy, and E_nu is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero.

Wait, but E_nu is the neutrino's total energy, which is equal to its momentum times c, because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since m is zero, E_nu = p_nu c.

Similarly, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). But since p_mu is related to p_nu because of momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude, opposite in direction but same magnitude because they're moving in opposite directions).

Wait, let's set up the equations more formally.

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu = 0.

The pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p_mu = -p_nu. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote p = |p_mu|, so p_nu = p as well.

So, the total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the units might be tricky. Wait, energy is in MeV, so perhaps I should work with units where c=1. Then E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p (since m_nu=0).

So the total energy equation is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

We can solve for p here.

Let me plug in the numbers:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV,
m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So,

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, let me write this as:

sqrt(p² + a²) + p = b,

where a = 105.7, b = 139.6.

Let me rearrange to isolate the square root:

sqrt(p² + a²) = b - p.

Now, square both sides:

p² + a² = (b - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: b² - 2 b p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

a² = b² - 2 b p.

Rearranged:

2 b p = b² - a².

So,

p = (b² - a²)/(2b).

Plugging in the numbers:

b = 139.6, a=105.7.

b² = (139.6)^2 ≈ let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

a² = 105.7^2. 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49. 2*100*5.7=1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So, p = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / (2 * 139.6).

Compute numerator: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2. Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. That's a bit higher than 8315. So maybe around 29.8?

Wait, let me compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 8315.67 is 8376 - 60.33. So 30 - (60.33/279.2) ≈ 30 - ~0.216 → 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c?

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units. Well, in these units where c=1, p would be in MeV/c units. So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the muon's total energy E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute that. 29.78^2 ≈ 887.0, 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 887 +11172=12059. Square root of 12059 is about 109.8 MeV. Let me check: 109^2=11881, 110^2=12100. 12059 is between 109 and 110. 109.8^2 = approx 120.56 *1000 → wait, 109.8 * 109.8 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 → 12056.04. Oh, close enough. So E_mu ≈ 109.8 MeV.

E_nu = p = ~29.78 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus rest energy.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

And KE_nu = E_nu - 0 = 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That looks spot on.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated p, I had (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2*139.6).

Wait 139.6^2 is 19488.16, 105.7^2 is 11172.49. Subtracting gives 8315.67. Divided by 2 *139.6=279.2.

8315.67 / 279.2 = let me compute that exactly.

Let me do 279.2 * 29 = 8100. (Because 279.2 *30=8376, so 29 would be 8376 -279.2=8096.8).

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * (30 -1)=8376 -279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. So 29 is less than p. Let me compute 279.2 * 29.784.

But perhaps using a calculator approach is better.

Wait, 279.2 * p = 8315.67.

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

I can do this division step by step. Let's see:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 → as above.

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, how many times does 279.2 go into 218.87? Approximately 0.78 times (since 279.2 * 0.78 ≈ 217.896). So p ≈ 29.78.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So then, E_mu is sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2) = sqrt(887 + 11172) = sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

KE_nu = 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches closely.

Wait, but let me think again about the kinetic energy. The neutrino's kinetic energy is just p, since its rest mass is zero, so E_nu = p. So in that case, yes, KE_nu is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the correct option is D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary π⁺ pion, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The reaction is:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Given Data:
- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Rest mass of neutrino: \( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay must be equal:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before and after the decay must be equal. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after the decay is zero:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Muon**: The total energy of the muon is given by:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
   \]
   where \( p_{\mu} \) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum.

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**: The total energy of the neutrino is:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu},
   \]
   since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

### Solving for Momentum:
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}.
\]

Let \( p = p_{\mu} \). Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p,
\]
\[
2 m_{\pi} p = m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Muon's Total Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   Compute \( 29.78^2 \approx 887.0 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.0 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.49} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Total Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies:
1. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} - m_{\nu} = 29.78 - 0 = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.1 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
