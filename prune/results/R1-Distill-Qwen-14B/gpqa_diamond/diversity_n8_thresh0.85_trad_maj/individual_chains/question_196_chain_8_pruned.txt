Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Right, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The formula is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the problem says it's relativistic, so I can't use the classical formula directly. Oh right, because when speeds get close to the speed of light, you have to consider special relativity effects.

So, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic part. The total energy for a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but when relativistic effects are considered, I think the potential energy might still be the same because the force is F = -kx, which is the classical expression. Wait, but in relativity, the force is still F = d(momentum)/dt, but momentum isn't just mv anymore. Momentum becomes gamma m v. So the equations of motion might change.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this by considering conservation of energy. At the maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't the simple (gamma - 1) m c². Hmm, so the total energy should be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, I think the approach is to have the total energy (rest + kinetic) at maximum speed equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement. So let's set up this equation.

At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero. So the total energy E is the potential energy U. U is (1/2)kA². Wait, but wait, in relativistic cases, does the potential energy change? Hmm, maybe not directly because the potential is given by Hooke's law, which is a classical concept. So perhaps the potential energy is still U = (1/2) k A².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum. At that point, all energy is kinetic. So E = Kinetic energy + rest energy. Wait, no, E is total energy, which includes rest energy. So E = gamma m c². Because the rest energy is mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So when x=0, all the energy is kinetic plus rest, so E = gamma m c².

So setting these equal: gamma m c² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but wait. The total mechanical energy is conserved. So at x = A, E = U = (1/2)k A². At x =0, E = Kinetic + rest energy. So (1/2)k A² = gamma m c².

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic plus rest. So E = K + mc². But in this case, perhaps the total energy is E = K + U, but U at x=0 is zero, so E = K.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think again.

In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is conserved. So when the oscillator is at x=A, all energy is potential, so E = (1/2)k A². Then, when it's at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma -1) m c² + m c² = gamma m c². So setting them equal: (1/2)k A² = gamma m c².

Wait, that can't be right because gamma is greater than or equal to 1, so (1/2)k A² would have to be larger than m c², which is unlikely except in extreme cases. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait another thought: the potential energy in a classical harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x². But in relativistic cases, perhaps the potential energy expression is different. Oh, wait, the problem states that it's a 1D oscillator obeying Hooke's law, so F = -k x. So the potential energy is the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)k x². So that part is classical.

So, the total mechanical energy is E = (1/2) k A². At x=0, this energy is all kinetic, which includes relativistic effects.

So the kinetic energy K is E - potential energy, but at x=0, potential is zero, so K = E = (1/2)k A².

Wait, wait. No, because in relativity, the kinetic energy is not just K = (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy is E = K + m c² = gamma m c². But since E is conserved, and at x= A, the energy is purely potential, which is (1/2)k A². So:

gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Wait, wait, no. At x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. But then, the total energy E includes the rest mass energy mc² plus kinetic energy. Wait, no, because in the case when the oscillator is at rest, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A², but that must equal the rest energy plus any other. Hmm, no, wait: in reality, the rest energy is always there. So when the oscillator is at x=A, its total energy is E = (1/2)k A² + m c². Because it's at rest (v=0) there, so energy is both rest and potential.

Wait, that makes sense. So E = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Then, when it's at x=0, moving with maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is E = (gamma) m c².

So setting them equal:

gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then the equation becomes:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me solve for v.

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + alpha).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + alpha)^2.

Rearrange:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Let me compute this:

v²/c² = [ (1 +
