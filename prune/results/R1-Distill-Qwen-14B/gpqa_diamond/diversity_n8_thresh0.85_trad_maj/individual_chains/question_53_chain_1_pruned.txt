Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1, right? So that makes sense. 

Looking at the NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break them down:

1. Two aromatic H signals. So the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents might be in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two different environments. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring would have two equivalent ortho and two equivalent meta positions, but wait, a para substitution would lead to a symmetrical structure. Hmm, wait no, a di-substituted ring could have substituents in positions like meta or ortho. But if both substituents are identical, maybe the ring is para-substituted, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic Hs. Or perhaps it's an ortho substitution, but that would lead to a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and another is something else, but the question says it's a di-substituted ring, so two substituents in total.

2. Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically found in environments like double bonds, so maybe we have a substituent with a double bond. Like an ester group attached to something with a double bond. Wait, the ester is O-C-O, but maybe the substituent is an ester group that's part of a substituent that has a double bond. Or perhaps the substituent is an alkenyl group attached to the ring.

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. So there are two sets of methyl groups. Maybe each methyl is part of different substituents. But wait, the substituents are two on the ring. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group, or maybe one substituent has two methyl groups. Hmm, but the problem states there are two signals for methyl groups, so probably two different methyl environments.

Also, there are no signals for -CH2 groups. So the structure doesn't have any methylene groups (CH2). That eliminates any possibility of having substituents with adjacent CH2 groups, like ethyl groups.

So putting this together, the aromatic ring has two substituents, each probably contributing to the NMR signals.

The ester group is present, so one of the substituents is an ester. Esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. Wait, no, the structure is RCOOR'. So the ester group would be O-CO-O, but wait, no, the ester is an acyl group attached via an oxygen. So like, R-O-CO-R', where R is from the ring.

So perhaps one substituent is an ester, maybe something like OAc (acetate) or another ester.

Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl Hs are a doublet and a doublet of quart
