Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. Oh right, it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct expression for v_max.

Wait, in the classical case, without relativity, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², and that equals (1/2)m v_max². So solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic case, so this can't be the answer.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light. So in that case, classical mechanics isn't sufficient, and we need to use relativistic equations. The kinetic energy in relativity isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, it's gamma minus one times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, in the relativistic scenario, the total energy of the oscillator includes both kinetic and potential. At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is at its maximum, but the kinetic energy is zero because the velocity is zero there. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the maximum velocity occurs when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), so at that point, all the energy is kinetic. But wait, the potential energy is maximum at x=A, so at that point, the kinetic energy is zero. So the system's total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy plus the potential energy?

Wait, no, I think that in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. But when you include relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. So the system's total energy E is mc² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, actually, the total mechanical energy in the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy plus the potential energy. Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², but in relativity, the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. Because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is stored as potential, and the kinetic energy is zero. Then, when it's at x=0, all the energy is kinetic (relativistic).

So, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is at maximum. The kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1) mc². So,

E = (gamma -1 ) mc² + mc²
E = gamma mc².

Wait, no. Let's correct that. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy:

E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential energy is zero. So all E is kinetic. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc², so:

E = (gamma -1 ) mc² + mc² = gamma mc².

Wait, that can't be right because E = mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

So, gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma is 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term to simplify. Let's call it a.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Taking reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+a)^2.

Hmm, let's compute 1 - [1/(1 +a)^2]. Let's factor that:

1 - 1/(1 +a)^2 = [ (1+a)^2 - 1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Expanding (1+a)^2: 1 + 2a + a².

So numerator is (1 + 2a + a² -1) = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is small if m is large or k is small. But for the general case, let's keep it as a.

So,

v² = c² * (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

But let's see if we can write this differently.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

2a + a² = a (2 + a) = a (2 + a).

But the denominator is (1 + a)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's substitute a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ ( 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ) ] / [ 1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ]^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So numerator becomes (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(m c²)) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ].

Multiply numerator and denominator by 4 m² c^4 to eliminate denominators:

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) from the numerator.

Wait, let me denote a = (k A²)/(2 m c²) as before.

Numerator is [2a + a²] = a (2 + a).

So,

v² = c² * a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

Substituting a:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² * (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2))) ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Simplify each term:

First term: (k A²)/(2 m c²) * c^2 = (k A²)/(2 m).

Wait, in the numerator, it's (k A²/(2 m c²)) multiplied by (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))).

Wait, let me compute each part:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

= c² [ ( (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2.

Let me factor this:

The numerator inside is (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) times (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))) = (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ].

The denominator is [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))]^2.

So,

v² = c² * (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))) / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 ].

Simplify the terms:

(k A^2/(2 m c^2)) * c² = (k A^2)/(2 m).

So,

v² = (k A^2)/(2 m) * (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))) / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 ].

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

v² = (k A^2)/(2 m) * [ (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2 ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe let's look for another approach.

Alternative approach: In relativistic mechanics, the energy of the oscillator is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, so E = K = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me let b = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + b.

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + b).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2.

= [ (1 + b)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

Expanding (1 + b)^2: 1 + 2b + b².

So numerator is (1 + 2b + b² - 1) = 2b + b².

So,

v² = c² * (2b + b²) / (1 + b)^2.

Substituting back b:

b = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v² = c² [ (2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ]^2.

Simplify numerator:

2 * (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

So,

v² = c² [ ( k A^2/(m c^2) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 ].

Factor out (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4) from numerator:

Wait, maybe it's better to factor out (k A^2)/(m c^2) from the first term and see.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as:

[ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ]

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A^2/(m c^2)) (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2 ].

Notice that (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))) is a common factor in numerator and denominator:

So,

v² = c² * (k A^2/(m c^2)) ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ).

Simplify:

(k A^2/(m c^2)) * c² = (k A^2)/m.

So,

v² = (k A^2/m) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ).

So,

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) )

= A sqrt( k/m ) / sqrt( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

Hmm, but none of the options directly match this. Let's look at the options.

Option A: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, but I have a denominator 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, perhaps I should factor out the 1/(1 + ... ) term.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the expression I have for v.

v^2 = (k A^2 / m) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)).

Let me factor the denominator as (1 + a), where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2 = (k A^2/m) * 1/(1 + a).

But I can write 1/(1+a) = [1/(1 + a)].

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the v expression as:

v^2 = [k A^2/(m)] * [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(m) ) ] * [ 1/( (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(m) ) * (2 m c^2)/(2 m c^2 + k A^2) ]

= (k A^2 * 2 m c^2) / [ m (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The m in the denominator cancels with the m in the numerator.

So,

v^2 = (2 c^2 k A^2) ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Factor denominator:

= (2 c^2 k A^2) / (2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )) )

Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, write as:

v^2 = (2 k A^2 c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Wait, 2 m c^2 is in the denominator.

So, perhaps factor 2 m c^2 from denominator:

Denominator = 2 m c^2 [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]

So,

v^2 = 2 k A^2 c^2 / [ 2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The 2 and m c^2 terms:

2 cancels numerator and denominator.

So,

v^2 = (k A^2 ) / [ m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Which brings me back to where I was before.

Hmm, maybe I can factor out 1/c^2 from the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should write v in terms of (k A^2/(2 m c^2)).

Let me think about the options again.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, no, option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )) multiplied by c.

Wait, let me check.

Option B: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) )

Is that possible?

Hmm. Let's see.

Wait, I have:

v^2 = [ (k A^2/m) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

= [ (k A^2)/(m) ] * [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(m) ] * [ 1/( (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(m) ) * (2 m c^2) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ]

= (2 c^2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, maybe we can factor k A^2 from numerator and denominator.

But perhaps I should think of v in terms of c times some function.

Wait, perhaps I can write:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(m) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) * 2 m c^2 ?

Wait, no. Let me see:

v^2 = (2 c^2 k A^2) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 2 k A^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps factor out 2 m c^2 from denominator:

Denominator: 2 m c^2 [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( 2 k A^2 / ( 2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )) )

= c * sqrt( (2 k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) * sqrt( 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Simplify (2 k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) = (k A^2)/(m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) * 1/ sqrt(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

= c * (A sqrt(k/m) / c ) * [ 1 / sqrt( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Simplify: c cancels with 1/c.

So,

v = A sqrt(k/m) * [1 / sqrt( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Hmm, I don't see this matching any of the options.

Wait, let's look at option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) )

So,

sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ]) = sqrt( ( (1 + a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a)^2 ) ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is sqrt( (1 + 2a + a^2 -1 ) / (1 +a)^2 )

= sqrt( (2a +a^2)/(1 +a)^2 )

= sqrt( a(2 +a) ) / (1 +a )

But a is small, but in our case, it's (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which could be any value.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B.

Wait, let me check option B again.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, 1 + [1/(1 - x)] would be (1 -x +1 )/(1 -x) ) = (2 - x)/(1 -x )

Which is more complicated.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the expression for v that I obtained earlier:

v^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m) ] / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]

So,

v^2 = (k A^2)/(m) * [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Which can be written as:

v^2 = (k A^2)/(m) * [ (2 m c^2)/(2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ]

= (k A^2 * 2 m c^2 ) / [ m (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ]

Simplify:

m cancels, so numerator is 2 c^2 k A^2, denominator is 2 m c^2 + k A^2.

So,

v^2 = (2 c^2 k A^2)/( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Can I factor this differently? Let's factor denominator:

Denominator: 2 m c^2 ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

So,

v^2 = [2 c^2 k A^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Cancel 2 c^2:

= [ k A^2 ] / [ m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

v^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ] * [ c^2 ] / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]

= ( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) * c^2 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

= ( (k A^2)/(m) ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

Which brings me back again. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can express the denominator as (1 + a), and the numerator as (2a + a^2).

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

v_max = sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ) / sqrt( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

Because,

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m) ) / sqrt( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

= sqrt( k A²/(m) ) / sqrt( ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) )

= sqrt( k A^2/(m) ) * sqrt( 2 m c^2 ) / sqrt(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

= (A sqrt(k/m)) * sqrt( 2 m c^2 ) / sqrt(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Simplify sqrt(2 m c^2) = c sqrt(2 m).

So,

v = A sqrt(k/m) * c sqrt(2 m) / sqrt(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

= A c sqrt(2 k m) / sqrt( (2 m c^2 + k A^2) )

Hmm, not matching the options yet.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, that looks like it's using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in setting up the energy equation.

Wait, alternative approach: in the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2) k x², same as before, but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

So total energy E = (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2) k A².

But at maximum speed, x=0, so the potential energy is zero, and E = (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, but E should also be equal to (gamma_0 -1 ) m c^2 + (1/2)k A^2, where gamma_0 is the rest mass factor.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So,

E = m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2.

Wait, yes, I think that's correct. Because the potential energy is the energy stored, so when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential plus rest energy.

So at x=0, the energy is all kinetic, so E = (gamma -1 ) m c^2.

So,

m c^2 + (1/2) k A^2 = (gamma -1 ) m c^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as before.

So I think that part is correct.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as b.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + b.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + b )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + b )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 +b )^2 ].

Which is,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + b )^2 -1 ) / (1 +b )^2 ]

= c^2 [ (1 + 2b + b² -1 ) / (1 +b )^2 ]

= c^2 ( 2b + b² ) / (1 +b )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2b + b^2 ) / (1 +b )^2 )

= c * sqrt( b (2 + b ) ) / (1 + b )^2 )

Wait, no, because sqrt is over numerator and denominator:

= c * sqrt( (2b + b²) ) / (1 + b )

= c * sqrt( b (2 +b )) / (1 +b )

Hmm, not seeing it yet.

Wait, another approach: let's write (2b + b²) as b (2 + b).

So,

v = c sqrt( b (2 +b ) ) / (1 + b )

= c sqrt( b (2 +b ) / (1 +b )^2 )

= c sqrt( [ b (2 + b) ] / (1 +b )^2 )

= c sqrt( b (2 +b ) ) / (1 +b )

But (2 +b ) = 2(1 +b ) - b.

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe take:

[ b (2 + b) ] = b ( 2 + b ) = 2b + b^2.

Wait, I'm stuck here, perhaps I should look for which option can be rewritten to match this expression.

Wait, the options:

Option A: sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, let's compute what's inside:

1 + 1/(1 - x)^2, where x is (k A^2)/(2m).

So,

1 + 1/(1 -x )² = [ (1 -x )² +1 ] / (1 -x )²

= (1 - 2x +x² +1 ) / (1 -x )²

= (2 -2x +x^2 ) / (1 -x )².

Hmm, doesn't seem to fit.

Option B: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m c^2) ) )

Let me compute inside:

1 + 1/(1 - y ), where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 -y ) +1 ] / (1 - y )

= (2 - y )/(1 - y )

So,

sqrt( (2 - y )/(1 - y ) )

Which can be rewritten as sqrt( (2 - y )/(1 -y ) )

Hmm.

But in our expression, v = c * sqrt( (2b + b^2)/(1 +b )^2 )

Wait, with b = y.

So, v = c * sqrt( (2y + y²) ) / (1 + y )

Which is v = c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Hmm.

But looking for an option that relates to this.

Option B's expression inside the sqrt is (2 - y)/(1 - y ), which is for y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), but I'm not sure if that connects.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to manipulate the expression I have for v^2.

v^2 = (2y + y^2 ) c^2 / (1 + y )^2.

= c^2 [ y (2 + y ) ] / (1 + y )^2.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

v^2 = c^2 [ y ( y + 2 ) ] / (y +1 )^2.

But I don't see an option that directly matches this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Which would be:

c * sqrt( 1 + [1/(1 - x )^2 ] ), x = (k A^2)/(2m).

Which is:

sqrt( [ (1 -x )^2 +1 ] ) / (1 -x )

= sqrt( 2 - 2x +x² +1 ) / (1 -x )

Wait, that's getting complicated.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which we know isn't it.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Wait, that's:

sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] ), where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is:

sqrt( [ (1 +y )^2 -1 ] / (1 +y )^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2y + y² -1 ) / (1 +y )^2 )

= sqrt( 2y + y² ) / (1 +y )

Which is exactly the same as our expression for v/c.

Because,

v = c * sqrt( (2y + y^2 ) ) / (1 + y )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2y + y^2 ) / (1 +y )^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

Wait, no, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is,

sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] )

= sqrt( ( (1 + y )^2 -1 ) / (1 + y )^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2y + y^2 -1 ) / (1 + y )^2 )

= sqrt( (2y + y^2 ) / (1 + y )^2 )

= sqrt(2y + y^2 ) / (1 + y )

Which is exactly the expression for v/c.

So,

v = c * [ sqrt(2y + y^2 ) / (1 + y ) ]

Which matches option D.

Wait, but wait:

No, option D is sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + y )² ] ), which is sqrt( ( (1+y)^2 -1 ) / (1+y)^2 ) = sqrt( (2y + y² ) / (1+y )^2 )

Which is the same as our expression, so v = c multiplied by that.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2y + y^2 )/(1+y )^2 )

Which is exactly what option D says.

Wait, no. Let me recheck the options.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is,

sqrt( 1 - 1/(1+y )^2 )

Which equals sqrt( ( (1+y )^2 -1 ) / (1+y )^2 )

Which is sqrt( (2y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2 )

= sqrt( (y (2 + y )) / (1 + y )^2 )

= sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Which is the same as our v in terms of y.

So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought option D was:

sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ] )

Which is what we have.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. In relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Substituting \( E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( y = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + y}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + y)^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + y)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect forms of the denominator or numerator, inconsistent with the derived expression.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, where \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), but this does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
