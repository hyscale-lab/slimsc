Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about titration and pH calculations. I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and pH tells us about the acidity or basicity of a solution.

Alright, the question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I have to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, okay, let's break it down step by step. First, the initial solution after dilution.

So, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. The initial acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Diluting with 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be half because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Got it. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. So the acetic acid will react with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So I need to find the amount of NaOH added and see what's left in solution.

Wait, let's calculate the moles first. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) times 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has reacted with acetic acid. So, the moles of acetic acid left will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume is important here. Because when we add NaOH, the total volume increases. Let's see, how much NaOH is added in moles. The volume of NaOH solution used can be found from moles and concentration.

Moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So the total solution volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5
