Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to a lab observer. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light? I'm a bit confused about how to approach this.

Wait, so the setup is a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. The observer is in the laboratory frame. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving in that same direction.

I think the key here is to consider how the speed of light is measured in different reference frames. From what I remember, Einstein's theory of relativity says that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. But wait, this is about a medium moving through the lab frame. So how does that affect the speed of light inside the medium?

In a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that change the speed as observed in the lab? I'm a bit shaky on this. Let me think about the Doppler effect maybe? Or perhaps it's more about adding velocities in relativity.

Wait, no, the Doppler effect is about the frequency or wavelength change due to relative motion, not the speed of light itself. Oh right, because the speed of light remains c in any inertial frame. But wait, in this case, the light is in a medium. Does the medium's motion
