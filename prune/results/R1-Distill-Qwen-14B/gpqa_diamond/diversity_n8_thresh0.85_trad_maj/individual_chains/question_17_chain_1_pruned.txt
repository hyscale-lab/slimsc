Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are ideal pH, and the temperature is 25 °C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

Wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think that Ca-EDTA is a complex ion, maybe like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part. The dissociation of this complex would release Ca²+ ions into the solution. So, the question is asking for the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in this solution.

I remember the formula involving the formation constant. The formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The K is given as 5x10^10, which is a large number, so the complex is very stable, meaning not much dissociation happens.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so let's denote that as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The stoichiometry is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA, so each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ when it dissociates.

The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But wait, I think the correct expression is K = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ). But wait, sometimes EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4− is the same as the concentration of free EDTA. Or perhaps, since the pH is ideal, the EDTA is in its Y^4- form, so [EDTA^4−] is equal to the total EDTA concentration not bound to Ca²+. Hmm, but wait, when the complex is formed, the EDTA is already in the Y^4- form.

Wait, maybe I should model the situation. The solution has the complex CaEDTA²− at 0.02 M.
