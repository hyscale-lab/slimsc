Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR and IR spectroscopy questions. But I'll take it step by step.

First, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Oh right! It's the hydrohalic acid addition to alkenes, maybe a halohydrin formation? Or wait, no, wait. Or is it a different reaction? Oh wait, red phosphorus is sometimes used in the substitution reactions, especially for the replacement of certain groups. Wait, no, maybe for the formation of acid chlorides or something else. Oh wait, wait a second. Oh right! When alcohols react with HI and red phosphorus, it's a method for converting alcohols to iodides. So that's probably what's happening here. So Compound X has an alcohol group, perhaps a secondary or tertiary alcohol, which upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus would form an iodide.

So, the first step is to figure out what Compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data, so I need to analyze those.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other options don't have N, I think it's an O-H. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. And the peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound likely has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) — that's probably an acidic proton, like a phenolic OH or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. If it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm, which fits. But wait, the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3000 for O-H, but maybe it's a broad peak that's part of the 3400–2500 region. Alternatively, this could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or something. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10, but in this case, it's a singlet. Hmm. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad and around 10-12 ppm. So that fits the 10.5 ppm peak.

But wait, the IR also has a 1720 cm-1, which can correspond to a carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, which fits. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR again: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) — that's a typical pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest two sets of protons, each with two equivalent H, so probably a para-substituted aromatic ring, like p-methyl or p-ethyl groups.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) — a multiplet suggests some kind of CH group adjacent to something, maybe a CH connected to an oxygen or another group. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) — possibly a CH2 group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) — a triplet? No, wait, a doublet of 3H. So maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group? Or perhaps a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, the 1.4 ppm with 3H as a doublet suggests a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3. So maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group. Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something like that.

Wait, but let
