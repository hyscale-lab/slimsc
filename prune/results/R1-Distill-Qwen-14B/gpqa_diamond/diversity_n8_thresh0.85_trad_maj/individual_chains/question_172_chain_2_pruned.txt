Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me read it again.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). I'm supposed to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T_1 and T_2.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the excitation of atoms depends on the thermal energy of the gas. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. Oh wait, but in this problem, we're comparing the same two energy levels in two different stars. So the statistical weights (g) should be the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same transition in iron. So the ratio simplifies to just the exponential part.

In star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2. Each R is (n_upper / n_lower) for each star.

So for each star, R = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But wait, the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

So plugging in, exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))).

Simplify further: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Hmm, let's rearrange terms. Let's bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left and the others to the right.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k). So ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me think again. Let me write the equation:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/(k): [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] * (ΔE/k) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but I'm trying to find an equation involving T1 and T2. Maybe I can rearrange terms differently.

Let me go back to R1 = 2 R2.

Which is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So exp( [ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)] ) = 2.

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Take natural log: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, so that gives (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2).

But I'm looking for an equation involving T1 and T2. Let me see if I can express this differently.

Let me rearrange the terms:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k / ΔE )

But the question gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, which is a specific value. But I don't think I need to plug it in because the options don't have numbers, only T1 and T2.

Wait, the options have ln(2) on the left side. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) ] = ln(2 )

Wait, how?

Wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting back:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

So we have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

Wait, but the options don't have k or ΔE, so perhaps the question assumes that the ratio is such that the constants cancel out, but that seems unlikely. Oh wait, perhaps the question is only about the form of the equation relating T1 and T2.

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ).

Wait, so comparing with my equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

But the options don't have the (k/ΔE) term. So perhaps in the problem, the equation is written as ln(2) equals something with T1 and T2, assuming that the constants are part of the setup.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is given as 1.38e-2
