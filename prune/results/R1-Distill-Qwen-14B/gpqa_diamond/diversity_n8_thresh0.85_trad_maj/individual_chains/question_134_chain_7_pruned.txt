Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, the problem states that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. And the question is about finding the enthalpy change, specifically the enthalpy of neutralization. Oh wait, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base.

But wait, in this case, there are three solutions being mixed. So I need to figure out all the possible reactions that can happen here. Let's list out the acids and the base.

HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid as well. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In strong acid conditions, H2SO4 will donate two H+ ions. So each molecule will contribute two H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit provides two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH⁻.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H2O, and each such reaction releases a certain amount of energy. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, I've heard that sometimes it's expressed in kcal. Let me think: 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal, so 57 kJ is roughly 13.65 kcal. So each mole of H+ reacting with a mole of OH- gives about -13.65 kcal (or -57 kJ) of enthalpy change.

But wait, wait. The problem is about the total enthalpy change when all these solutions are mixed. So I need to find out how many moles of H+ are available from the acids and how many moles of OH- are available from the base. Then, the limiting reagent will determine how much reaction occurs.

Let's calculate the moles for each acid and base.

Starting with HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M × V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 liters. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since H2SO4 is diprotic and a strong acid, each mole gives two H+. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. 200 mL is 0.2 liters. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So let's see which is in excess.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.28 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- can only react 0.2 moles each. So all the OH- will be neutralized, and there will be some H+ left over.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, with enthalpy change of -57 kJ per mole (or -13.65 kcal per mole). Since 0.2 moles of OH- (which equals 0.2 moles of H+) are reacting, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Oh wait, but wait, the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so my initial calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is close to option D, which is -16.0 kJ. Wait, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles.

Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1
