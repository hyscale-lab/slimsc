Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about phosphate buffer solutions and ion concentrations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In it, there's 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4●2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base here. Wait, let me think. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+. So, the given salts are K H2PO4 and Na2 HPO4·2H2O.

Right, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, gives Na+, HPO4^2-, and water? Or wait, no, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh, wait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-.

So, the solution is a buffer because it has a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). In a buffer solution, the pH is determined by the pKa of the acid and the ratio of the concentrations of the base and the acid.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3-, not HPO4^2-. Hmm. So, I'm a bit confused. Because HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, and PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

But in solution, the phosphate species present are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-, depending on the pH. Since we have both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4), the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait a minute, but the question is about PO4^3- concentration. So, PO4^3- is present only in very small amounts unless the solution is highly basic, which I don't think it is. But let me think.

I think I should calculate the concentrations of each species in the solution and then find PO4^3-.

But how? Let's recall. The phosphate buffer system is a series of equilibria. The given K values are for each dissociation step.

The relevant K values are Ka2 and Ka3. Because the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

So, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- depends on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the H+ concentration in the solution.

But wait, first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

Let me calculate the moles of each salt.

First, for KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈
