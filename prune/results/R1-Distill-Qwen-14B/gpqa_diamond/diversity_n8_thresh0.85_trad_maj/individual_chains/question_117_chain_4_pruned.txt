Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, as I remember, occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I need to look for molecules with at least one chiral center.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me break it down. It's a biphenyl structure with substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups at the 6 positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 positions on each phenyl ring. Now, since it's a biphenyl, I'm thinking about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, maybe it doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, but the substituents are on opposite sides? Or arranged in a way that creates asymmetry? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, the biphenyl could have a certain configuration. Wait, another possibility: if the two substituents on each ring are in positions that make each ring symmetrical, but the combination of the two rings could create a situation where the molecule is chiral. Wait, but biphenyls can have different configurations. Wait, in biphenyls, the way the two rings are connected (like whether they're trans or cis) can affect symmetry. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could have a chiral center. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is on the para position relative to the connecting ring. So, for each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are at 6 and 2 positions. Wait, 6 on one ring is adjacent to the connecting ring (since biphenyl is 1,1'), so the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, but in a benzene ring, 1 is the connecting point, 2 is adjacent, and 6 is opposite to that. So, 2 and 6 are across from each other. So on each ring, we have a nitro group at 6 (which is opposite to the connecting ring) and a carboxylate at 2 (adjacent to the connecting ring). So for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. That would make each phenyl ring have substituents opposite each other, but also considering the other ring. Wait, I'm not sure if that leads to a chiral center. Alternatively, the molecule might have a center of symmetry. Since each substituent is mirrored on the other ring, maybe it's symmetrical. So, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism here. Or maybe not? Wait, maybe the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. I'm not entirely sure, this might require more detailed analysis, but I'll tentatively say that this one doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.
