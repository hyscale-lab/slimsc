Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things might be different.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c, and we need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the classical case without relativity, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is v_max = sqrt(k A² / m). That's because at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the maximum KE is (1/2)kA², and setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² gives the formula.

But since this is relativistic, I think we have to consider the effects of special relativity, like how kinetic energy changes with velocity. Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by KE = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is like (1/2)kx². At maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So we can set (1/2)kA² equal to (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, but wait. In the classical case, at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is maximum. So when the mass passes through the equilibrium point, all that potential is converted to kinetic. So yeah, in the relativistic case, the same logic applies, but with relativistic KE.

So let's set up the equation:
(1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c²

We can solve this for γ, then find v.

Let me rearrange that:
γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So γ is 1 + something. But wait, I thought γ is always greater than or equal to 1, which it is here because k, A, m are positive.

Now, γ is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable for simplicity, say 'a'. So γ = 1 + a.

Wait, but maybe it's better to write it as:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Hmm, let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]²

Then take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Wait, no, wait. If I have 1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ ... ]², then [1 - v²/c²] = 1/[ ... ]².

Wait, let me write it step by step.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as b. Then:

γ = 1 + b

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + b

Squaring both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + b)^2

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2]

So,

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ]

Hmm, that can be rewritten as:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + b)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + b)^2 ) ]

Expanding (1 + b)^2 = 1 + 2b + b². So,

(1 + b)^2 -1 = 2b + b² = b (2 + b)

So,

v² = c² [ b (2 + b) ) / (1 + b)^2 ]

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as v² = c² (1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 )

So,

v² = c² [ ( (1 + b)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + b)^2 ) ]

Wait, maybe I can factor it differently. Let me compute:

1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 = [ (1 + b)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + b)^2

= [1 + 2b + b² -1 ] / (1 + b)^2

= (2b + b²) / (1 + b)^2

= b (2 + b) / (1 + b)^2

Hmm, so that's the expression for v².

But wait, let's substitute back b = k A²/(2 m c^2)

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Hmm, that looks complicated. Let me see if I can simplify the numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the expression for v in terms of γ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the answer options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is sqrt(k A^2/m), which is the classical result. But since we're considering relativity, that can't be the correct answer. So probably, the correct answer is one of the others.

Options A and B have sqrt(1 + ...) and terms with k A^2/(2 m) or 2m c^2.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all that potential is converted to kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1) m c².

So,

(1/2) k A² = (γ - 1) m c²

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me write this as:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) )]^2

Then,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ) )^2 ]

Hmm, that's an expression for v.

Wait, perhaps I can express this as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/( ... )^2 )

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, let me see:

Wait, our expression for v^2 is c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ] where b is (k A^2)/(2 m c²)

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 )

Which can be written as c * sqrt( ( (1 + b)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + b)^2 ) )

Which simplifies to c * sqrt( (2b + b² ) / (1 + b)^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( b (2 + b) ) / (1 + b )

But perhaps that's not the way the options are presented.

Looking back at the options, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which matches our expression. So that's option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/( ... )) which doesn't match.

Option B has a denominator without a square in the fraction inside the sqrt.

So, our conclusion is that option D is correct.

Wait, but let me compute it again.

Wait, our equation for v is:

1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ]^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2 ]

Which is,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ]

Which is the same as in option D.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we must account for relativistic effects. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by \( KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At maximum speed, all the potential energy \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) is converted into kinetic energy. Setting these equal:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
\]

Taking the reciprocal:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2 = c^2 \left[1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}\right]
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation principle or do not simplify correctly. For example, Option C corresponds to the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects, while Options A and B have incorrect forms for the relativistic adjustment.

**Answer: D**
