Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the various planes and axes that leave the molecule looking the same after certain operations. The notation C3h, I think, refers to a type of symmetry involving a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, the h in C3h stands for horizontal, right? So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about each option and their structures.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, the name is a bit complicated. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. Trifuran would mean three furan rings, I think. And the numbering is a bit tricky. I'm picturing a structure with three phenyl groups attached to a central part, possibly a tricyclic system. The substitution pattern might be symmetric. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the symmetry here. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, maybe it could have a three-fold axis. But wait, the h in C3h suggests a horizontal mirror plane as well.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This one also has a benzo part, so a benzene ring. The trifuran indicates three furan rings attached. The numbering might be such that the substituents are in a symmetric pattern. I'm trying to visualize it. Maybe it's like a central tricyclic structure with benzene rings attached in a symmetrical way. But I'm not certain. Maybe benzene rings are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. So this is (i-Pr)3BO, right? The structure is a borate with three isopropyl groups attached to the boron. So the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron. Wait, each isopropyl group is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So, all three substituents are the same. So the structure should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's see: if you look along the B atom, each substituent is the same, so rotating 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. But what about a mirror plane? If the molecule is non-planar, maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the B-atom's plane. Wait, the borate ion is trigonal planar, so the molecule is flat. So, a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. So, looking at this, triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), so it should have C3h symmetry. Hmm, so option C could be the answer.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think. It has a bridge structure between two rings. The structure is a norbornane-like compound, which is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Wait, but wait, I think quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane? Or maybe another structure. Let me think. No, quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge, and it's known for its chair-like structure. But what's its symmetry? It has a three-fold axis, perhaps? Wait, no, norbornane has a C2 axis, I think. Quinuclidine, being a larger bicyclic structure, might have a different symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a chair-like structure with a three-fold axis. Hmm, not so sure. Wait, quinuclidine has a bridge, making it a tricyclic? No, I think it's a bicyclic with two bridgeheads. But regardless, I'm not certain about its symmetry.

So, back to the options. If triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, it should have C3h symmetry. So that would be an answer.

Wait, the question is which of the following has C3h symmetry. So I thought option C is correct. Let me check the other options again.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. So it's a trifuran system (three furan rings) connected to a triphenylene group. Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule, with three benzene rings connected in a truxene-like structure. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis, perhaps, and mirror planes. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the central part is symmetric, then maybe. Hmm, but the substituents are on the furan rings. Let me think about the structure. If the substituents are attached in a way that allows for a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then C3h would apply. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could have a higher symmetry, like D3h, but the question is about C3h.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So this is a trifuran where each furan is connected to a benzene ring. The numbering suggests that the benzene rings are attached in a symmetrical way. But each benzene is in a different position. I'm not sure if a three-fold axis exists here. Maybe only a two-fold axis or other symmetries, not C3h.

So, putting it all together, I think option C, triisopropyl borate, has C3h symmetry because it's trigonal planar with three identical substituents, which gives a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. The other options might have different symmetries.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule consists of a triphenylene group connected to a trifuran system. The triphenylene group is symmetric, but the substitution pattern on the trifuran rings may not allow for a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane simultaneously. The symmetry here is likely lower than **C₃h**.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule has a benzene ring connected to a trifuran system. The substitution pattern on the benzene and furan rings does not appear to support a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. The symmetry is likely different from **C₃h**.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate, (i-Pr)₃BO, has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups. This arrangement provides a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), satisfying the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry. This molecule fits the criteria perfectly.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. While it has some symmetry, it does not possess a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Its symmetry is different from **C₃h**.

Based on this analysis, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry. 

Answer: C
