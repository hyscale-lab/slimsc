Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both orbits are circular. Their host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So, which one is better?

Wait, what factors affect the transit probability? I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Also, the size of the star matters because a larger star makes transiting less likely if the planet is the same size.

But wait, how about the orbital parameters? The transit probability is given by the formula something like (R_planet / R_star) * (1 + sqrt( (R_star / a) )) or something. Or wait, another approach: the probability is roughly proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by some function involving the orbital distance. Let me think again.

Oh wait, no, the transit probability formula I recall is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p) / a ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another way: The probability of a transit is proportional to the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size, squared, and inversely proportional to the orbital distance. Or wait, no, perhaps it's more about the orbital inclination. The probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits from our point of view is higher if a is larger, because the planet's orbit is more likely to edge-on.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability formula is P = (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2) * (something). Or perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1/(1 + (a/R_s))), but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't do that right now, I'll try to reason it out.

Wait, another approach: The probability of transit is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be edge-on relative to our line of sight
