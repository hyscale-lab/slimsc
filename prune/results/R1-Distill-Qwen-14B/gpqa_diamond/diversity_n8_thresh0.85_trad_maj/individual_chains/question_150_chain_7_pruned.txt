Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's break it down. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is 9, X is 0 (since no halogens), N is 1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's either five rings, or a combination of rings and double bonds. Common structures with this would be something like a benzene ring (which counts as 4) plus a double bond elsewhere, or maybe a benzene and an amine or something.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a downfield proton, probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So the triplet suggests neighboring two protons maybe. Wait, but aldehyde is RCHO, so the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH. Hmm, but a triplet would mean two neighboring protons, so maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group? Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a specific environment, but aldehyde is more likely.

Next, 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. So maybe aromatic protons. Then 6.51 ppm is also a doublet of 2H, which could be another set of aromatic protons. Then 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange, like OH protons, but it's a singlet. Wait, but the integration is 2H. So if it's a singlet and broad, perhaps it's two equivalent protons in an environment where they're not split by neighboring Hs. Maybe they're part of a conjugated system. Or maybe it's an enol form or something.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Because OCH2 groups typically show up around 3-4 ppm. So maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen.

Putting this together, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Wait, the aldehyde at 9.72, and two aromatic rings? Because the NMR shows multiple aromatic signals.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, including one from the aldehyde (CHO). Let's think about the structure. Maybe it's a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde group and some substituents.

Looking at the options, all of them have 'but' in their names, which suggests a four-carbon chain. Let me think. Option A is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So the structure would be Ph-C-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO? Or maybe Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond at position 3? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a four-carbon chain with substituents.

Wait, maybe it's something like a benzaldehyde connected to another benzene ring via a chain. Let me try to draw this out mentally. The aldehyde is at one end, then a double bond, and two phenyl groups attached.

Wait, the NMR shows 9.72 ppm as triplet, 1H. So the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group perhaps. Because if the aldehyde is at the end, adjacent to a CH2, that CH2's protons would be next to the aldehyde, causing triplet splitting. Because each H on CH2 would be next to the aldehyde's H. Wait, but the aldehyde is a single proton. So if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2, each H on the CH2 would be next to one proton, so the aldehyde's H would be a triplet. Because each of the two Hs on the CH2 would split it into a triplet (n+1 where n=2). So that makes sense.

So the structure might be something like CH2CH2CHO, but with substituents. Wait, but it's a but-enal, so four carbons in the chain.

Let me think about the reaction steps. The compound is reacted with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aq KOH and heat. Hmm, that sounds like diazotization followed by hydrolysis. Diazonium salt formation, maybe.

Wait, NaNO2 and HCl are used to form a diazonium chloride. Then H2
