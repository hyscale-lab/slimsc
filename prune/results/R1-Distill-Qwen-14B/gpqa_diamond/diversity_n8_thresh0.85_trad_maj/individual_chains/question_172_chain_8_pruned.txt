Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's start breaking it down.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1 have twice as many excited atoms in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between those levels.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), but wait, I think it's actually n_j / n_i = exp( (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), assuming E_i is higher than E_j. Wait, no, let me think again. The equation is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Because higher energy states have fewer particles, so if E_i > E_j, then n_i < n_j. So the ratio depends on the energy difference and temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the lower level as j and the higher as i. So the number of atoms in the higher level (i) relative to the lower (j) is n_i / n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

But wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So for star_1, n_i is twice that of star_2's n_i? Wait, no, the wording is a bit unclear. It says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Oh, I think it means that the fraction of excited atoms (in the higher energy level) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). Or perhaps n_i1 = 2 * n_i2? Wait, no, because n depends on the ratio of the two levels. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, in each star, the fraction of iron atoms in the excited state (level i) compared to the ground state (level j) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, (n_i / n_j) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star_1, (n_i1 / n_j1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, (n_i2 / n_j2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm. So maybe in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. So n_i1 = 2 * n_i2. But wait, no, because the total number of atoms could vary. Alternatively, the ratio of excited to non-excited atoms is twice as much in star_1.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's define the excitation as the ratio n_i / n_j. So in star_1, that ratio is twice that of star_2. So:

n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2 )

But from Boltzmann, n_i / n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1: (n_i1 / n_j1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n_i2 / n_j2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the equation becomes:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no, because n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2 ). So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural log of both sides to simplify. Let's do that.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange this. Let's bring the terms involving ΔE to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is negative if T1 > T2. But
