Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax is something I remember is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars is the same in all regions, but I think it's in terms of volume here. So if the universe is filled with stars uniformly, the number density is constant.

I need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range (like, say, per 0.1 arcseconds) changes as parallax (plx) increases or decreases. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, right? So as plx increases, the star is closer because parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax (p) is approximately equal to 1 divided by distance (d) in parsecs. So p = 1/d. So d = 1/p. That makes sense.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's imagine a small range of parallax, say from p to p + dp. I want to find out how many stars there are in this range, N, and see how N depends on p.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. So in a volume V, the number of stars is N = n * V.

But wait, the volume depends on the distance. So for a given parallax range, how much volume does that correspond to?

Let me think. The volume between distances d and d + dd is a spherical shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between r and r + dr would be approximately 4π r² dr.

But wait, in our case, the parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So dd, the change in distance, would relate to dp, the change in parallax. Let's see, d = 1/p → dd = -1/(p²) dp. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but we'll take the magnitude here since we're dealing with ranges.

So, the volume element is 4π d² dd. Let's change variables from d to p. Since d = 1/p, d² = 1/p². And dd is (-1/p²) dp, so the absolute value is (1/p²) dp.

Putting it together: dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The volume element is 4π d² dd. Substituting d =1/p, so d² = 1/p². And dd = (1/p²) dp (since d =1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp → take the absolute value). So dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check substitution again. So:

dV (the volume element in distance terms) is 4π d² dd.

But since we're looking at parallax, which is p = 1/d, let's express d in terms of p:

d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp.

So, substituting into dV, we have:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ) → but since we're considering the magnitude, the negative goes away:

dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number of stars in a small volume element dV is N = n * dV = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So the number per unit p (like per arcsecond) is N per dp, which would be (n * 4π / p^4) dp. So per unit dp, that's (n *4π / p^4) stars per unit parallax.

But wait, the options given are about how the number changes with plx, so the number per unit plx range (like how many stars per 0.1 plx). So the number N in a range dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit change in parallax dp is proportional to 1/p^4. So looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4, so that would be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Since the volume as a function of p is 4π/p^4 dp, and the number of stars is proportional to the volume, then the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dp) decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait another approach. Let's imagine that the number density of stars is n per cubic parsec. So the number of stars in a volume V is n*V. So if I have a shell between d and d + dd, the volume is 4π d² dd. So the number here is n *4π d² dd. But since d =1/p, this is n *4π (1/p)^2 (1/(p^2) dp) ) → n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So again, number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back at the question: 'how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?' So per unit plx, like per 1 arcsecond, the number is inversely proportional to plx^4.

But wait, another way to think about it: the number per unit volume is n. The volume at a certain distance d is a shell of radius d and thickness dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n*4π d² dd. Since d =1/p, the number becomes n*4π (1/p)^2 (1/p² dp) ) → n*4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit plx range (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars in a given range (like 1 to 2 parsecs) would be proportional to 1/p^4. So that's why the number per unit plx is 1/p^4. So option A is correct.

But wait, another approach. Maybe in terms of flux or something else? No, I think the approach is correct. So the answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). For a small range of parallax \( dp \), the corresponding distance range \( dd \) is \( dd = -1/p^2 \, dp \). The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \), the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{p^2} \, dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume element is proportional to the volume. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**

Answer: A
