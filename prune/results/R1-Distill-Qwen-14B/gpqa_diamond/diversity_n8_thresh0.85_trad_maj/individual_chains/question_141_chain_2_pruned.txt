Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. They're asking how many possible organic products there are. The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-dâ€”wait, 1 and 2 positions on the benzene ring. Oh, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1 and 2 would be adjacent positions, making it a bromobenzene with the Br in the para position, or no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the structure.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Because benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 1-bromo-2-d something? Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene or something. Wait, actually, the '-d' part is confusing me. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Because sometimes 'd' is used as a suffix for certain substituents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl or another substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating
