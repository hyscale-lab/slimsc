Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A through D.

First, I remember that in special relativity, to find the relative speed between two objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just subtract their speeds like we do in classical mechanics. Instead, we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, which one is moving faster? Because the formula depends on which is which.

Wait, let me get this straight. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the frame of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second? Or is it the other way around? The problem says "relative speed", but I'm not sure which direction. Because relative speed can be from one's frame to another. Oh but the options give different results, so I have to compute both possibilities.

Wait, no. Let me think. The question is about the relative speed between them. Since they're both moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but relativistically. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of the object and v is the speed of the frame. So if I'm in A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and B is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame, then in A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

So that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) → (-0.1c)/0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but speed is magnitude, so 0.1428c. Alternatively, if we were to compute from B's frame, the speed of A would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) → (0.1c)/(1 -0.3) → (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So regardless, the relative speed is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0
