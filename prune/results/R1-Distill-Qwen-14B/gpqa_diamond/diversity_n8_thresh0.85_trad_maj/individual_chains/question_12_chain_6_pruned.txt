Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, I think. Oh wait, the problem says it's nu, which I remember stands for neutrino. So the equation is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino.

The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Wait, the rest masses are given. Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Right, so the neutrino's mass is considered zero or negligible in these kinds of problems. I think neutrinos are treated as massless particles in such decay calculations because their mass is so tiny compared to other particles.

So, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, like here, the process must conserve energy and momentum. But since the parent is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. Because the initial momentum is zero, the products must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, in this case, the Pi(+) decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. Neutrino has negligible mass, so maybe I can model this as the muon carrying away some energy and the neutrino the rest, but energy and momentum must balance.

Let me think. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi(+) because it's at rest. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero.

So, E_total_initial = E_total_final.

E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

E_final = E_muon + E_neutrino.

E_muon = m_mu*c^2 + K_muon. Wait, but I think in particle physics, c is set to 1 in units, so E_muon would be m_mu + K_muon, where K is the kinetic energy.

E_neutrino = K_neutrino.

So the energy conservation equation is:

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu
