Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions, so I need to find the correct sequence of steps that would lead to the desired product.

First, I'll break down the target molecule. The molecule is a benzene ring substituted with three groups: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3 around the ring. Wait, no, the numbering is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me think about how the substituents are arranged. Benzene is a ring, so I can imagine them in a meta arrangement, but more precisely, 1, 2, 3 are adjacent to each other, so they're all ortho and meta to each other. So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.

Now, the plan is to figure out the order of reactions needed to introduce these groups. In aromatic substitution reactions, the order in which substituents are introduced can affect the outcome because each substitution directs the next. So I need to think about the directing effects of each group.

The substituents have different directing effects. Let's recall:
- Nitro groups are meta directors.
- Ethoxy groups are ortho/para directors, but since they are electron-donating via resonance, but wait, waitâ€”wait, ethoxy is actually an activating group, so it's ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait: no, wait. Wait, ethoxy is an activating group because the oxygen donates electrons through resonance. So, it's an activating, ortho/para director. Similarly, the tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent. tert-Butyl is an alkyl group, so it's electron-donating via induction, making the ring more reactive, and it's a strong activating group. Also, it's a bulky group, so it probably directs incoming electrophiles to the less hindered positions, but generally, alkyl groups are ortho/para directors.

Wait, but wait: the substituents we have are nitro (which is deactivating, meta directing), ethoxy (activating, ortho/para), and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so it's a meta director. The other two are activating, so they are ortho/para directors.

But when multiple groups are present, the substituents' directing effects can be tricky because the strongest director usually takes precedence. So, which groups are present when each substitution occurs?

The target molecule has these substituents in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, let's imagine the substitutions in the order they were added.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by thinking about the possible synthesis steps. Let me think about how to add each substituent.

The target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, I need to add these in some order. The order will influence where each group is attached.

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Introduce one substituent, then another, then the third.

But which substituent to add first? Nitration is a common reaction, and introducing nitro groups can be tricky because once present, the nitro group is a strong meta director.

Wait, the target has the nitro group in position 3. Let me think about the numbering. Suppose I start with benzene, then add ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. But the positions are 1, 2, 3. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are added in a way that each new group is added in a position relative to the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps to get all three substituents in position 1,2,3, the order must be such that each addition is directed correctly.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects.

Suppose I first introduce the tert-butyl group. Since it's an activating, ortho/para director, the next substituent could be added either ortho, para, or meta to it. Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the next substituent will go where it's directed by the existing substituents. So, perhaps the order of adding substituents is important.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Let me think about that.

Wait, but the target molecule has the nitro in position 3, ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2. So, maybe the nitro group was added
