Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values—delta_0 is 90 degrees, delta_1 is 67, delta_2 is 55, delta_3 is 30, and delta_4 is 13 degrees. Oh wait, and I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. So I guess that means for l=0 to 4, these are the given values, and higher l's aren't considered.

The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of phase shifts. The formula I recall is something like f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ] multiplied by some factors, but wait, the exact formula might be a bit different.

Wait, no. I think the correct expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l +1) * e^{i δ_l} * sin(lθ + δ_l) ] where k is the wave number, and the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum. But wait, the imaginary part of f would be of interest here.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, the incident direction would be θ = 0 degrees. So I need to evaluate f(0) and take its imaginary part.

So I should compute f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l +1) * e^{i δ_l} * sin(l*0 + δ_l) ]

Wait, sin(l*0) is sin(0), which is zero except when l=0. Because for l=0, sin(0 + δ0) is sin(δ0). For l>0, sin( l*0 + δ_l ) is sin(δ_l), but l*0 is zero, so it's sin(δ_l). Wait no, wait, when l=0, the argument is 0 + delta_0, which is delta_0. For l=1, it
