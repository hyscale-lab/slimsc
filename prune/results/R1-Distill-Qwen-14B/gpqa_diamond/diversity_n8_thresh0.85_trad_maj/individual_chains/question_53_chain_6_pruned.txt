Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes me think there's an -O-CO-O- or an ester functional group attached. Wait, no, esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but in this case, maybe it's something like an aryl ester or an alkoxy ester.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR has six signals. Two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H, and two CH3 groups. No CH2 signals. Hmm. So aromatic H suggests that the substituents might be in a para or ortho position? Wait, but a di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. Let me think.

The aromatic ring is six-membered, so maybe it's a benzene ring. The two substituents are probably such that they don't cause too many splitting in the aromatic region. But the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H. That might mean that there are two different types of H on the ring. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two equivalent H's on each substituent, but wait, no, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the ring might have two sets of equivalent H's. Or maybe it's an ortho substitution, leading to more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two distinct types of H, like if it's a vic-dihydroxy structure, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, the FTIR has an ester group, so perhaps the substituents are ester groups. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else. But wait, the problem says di-substituted, so two substituents. But the ester is one group, which would contribute two oxygen atoms. Oh wait, the formula options have O2, so the molecule has two oxygen atoms. So the ester group would account for that. So maybe it's a mono-ester, but wait, no, di-substituted. Oh, perhaps each substituent is an ester group? But that might require more oxygens. Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O. So each ester would have two oxygen atoms. But that's probably not the case here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group. But the options have O2, so the substituents must account for two oxygens. So maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is an oxygen-containing group, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is an ester, but that would require more oxygens. Wait, no, the formula is O2, so the substituents can't be more than that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O, but that would contribute three oxygen atoms. Wait, that's not possible. Because the formula has only two oxygen atoms. So maybe the substituents are different. Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else that doesn't add an oxygen. But that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe both substituents are alkoxy groups, but that would give O2, but that's a possibility. But then in the NMR, the aromatic protons would split into two sets, which matches the two signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-OR), but that would have more oxygen. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals. There are two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H, and two CH3 groups. The absence of CH2 signals suggests that there are no methylene groups in the molecule. So perhaps the substituents are either methyl groups or vinyl groups.

Wait, the vinyl Hs are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets because each H is adjacent to one other H. But a doublet of quartets suggests perhaps coupling with two different sets of H, maybe from adjacent groups. Or maybe it's an AB system.

Wait, but considering that the substituents are on the benzene ring, perhaps the substituents are groups that have vinyl protons. For example, an ester group that's part of a vinyl group. Or maybe the substituents are groups like -COOCH2CH3, but that would have CH2 groups, which would show up as a quartet in the NMR, but the problem states there are no CH2 signals. Hmm.

Wait, the substituents could be esters attached via a vinyl group. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ester groups, but connected through a double bond, like perhaps an acrylate ester or something. Let me think.

Wait, let's consider the possible structure. If the ring has two substituents, each is an ester. But wait, each ester would contribute two oxygens, so that would require four oxygens, which the formula doesn't have. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group. But that's an ester. For example, the substituents could be -O-CO-OCH3 or something. Wait, but that would again be more oxygen.

Wait, maybe each substituent is a methoxy group. Then, O2 would be accounted for. But then, the substituents would be OMe groups. So, the di-substituted benzene would have two OMe groups. But then, the NMR would show aromatic H, perhaps as two signals. But then, where are the vinyl H and CH3 groups?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not OMe. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ester groups attached via a single bond. For example, maybe the substituents are -COOCH3. Wait, but that would be a carbonyl group. But each -COOCH3 would have an ester group, so each substituent is an ester. That would mean two ester groups, which would have four oxygen atoms. But the formula only has O2. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach this differently.

The NMR has six signals. Two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. So perhaps the molecule has three different types of H: aromatic, vinyl, and methyl.

So, first, the aromatic H. Two signals mean two distinct environments. For a di-substituted benzene, this could happen in several ways. If the substituents are para to each other, the ring would have two equivalent H in each position, leading to two signals. For example, if the ring has two substituents in para positions, then the H adjacent to substituent A and substituent B would be in different environments, but maybe only two types.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, the H might be in more complex patterns, but perhaps also split into two signals.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two types of H. For example, if it's a 1,3-disubstitution (meta), maybe the H are in two different environments.

But perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two H types. So that's the aromatic signals.

Now, the vinyl Hs: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So vinyl Hs are adjacent to each other, perhaps part of a double bond. The doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent H, and the quartet suggests coupling with another set of H, maybe two Hs. So perhaps it's a trans coupling. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-, but wait, that's a methylene group, which would have a quartet if next to another CH2. But the problem says there are no CH2 signals, so that can't be the case.

Wait, maybe the vinyl Hs are part of a group like CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is attached to another substituent, causing the splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are ester groups that have a vinyl group attached. For example, an ester group with a double bond. Maybe something like -COOCH2CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl group. Wait, but in that case, the CH2 groups would show up as signals, but the problem says no CH2 signals. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -O-CO-O-R groups, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are -CH2COO- groups, but that would introduce CH2, which we don't have.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -CH2 groups, but that would produce CH2 signals, which aren't present. So that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe I should think about possible structures that match the NMR data. Let's think about the possible structures with a benzene ring, two substituents, an ester group, and the NMR signals.

Let me consider that the substituents are a methyl ester and another group. Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals, so maybe there are two methyl groups. Or perhaps one is part of the ester and another is elsewhere.

Wait, the two CH3 groups in the NMR: perhaps one is attached directly to the ring and the other is part of an ester.

Alternatively, the substituents could be a methyl ester and another methyl group attached directly to the ring. But then, the ring would have two substituents, one OMeCO-something and another Me group. But then, the ester would contribute O and the Me group would add CH3.

Wait, but the molecule's formula needs to be one of the options, so let's check the possible formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

So, the molecular formula is either C11 or C12, with varying H and O.

The ester group is O-CO-O-R, so that's O2. So, the substituents must include an ester group, which would account for O2.

Wait, but each ester has O2. So, if there's one ester group, that's O2. So the di-substituted benzene would have two substituents, one being an ester, and the other perhaps a methyl group. Let me think.

So, if one substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-O-R), but wait, that would have O3. Hmm, no, because the formula is O2. So, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester (-COOCH3). That would contribute O2.

So, let's model the structure: benzene ring with two substituents. One is -COOCH3 (ester), and the other is a methyl group (-CH3). So, substituents are -COOCH3 and -CH3.

In that case, the benzene would have substituents in positions that create two distinct aromatic H environments. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, the ring H would have two sets. Alternatively, if substituents are meta, the situation could be different.

But wait, the NMR shows two aromatic H signals. So, perhaps the substituents are in the para position, leading to two sets of Hs on the ring. Let's think about that.

In a para-disubstituted benzene, if one substituent is an ester group (-COOCH3) and the other
