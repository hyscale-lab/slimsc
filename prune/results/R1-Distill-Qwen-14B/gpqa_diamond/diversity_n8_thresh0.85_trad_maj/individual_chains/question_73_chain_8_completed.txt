Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula. But wait, what's the formula again? I think it's something like (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²), but I'm not totally sure. Oh wait, actually, the formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v relative to a stationary frame isn't just a simple sum. Let me get this straight. So if one astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, what's the relative speed of the faster one with respect to the slower one?

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the relative speed between the two astronauts. So I think I need to find the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So in the frame of A, what's B's speed? Or vice versa? Because it depends on which way you're considering.

Wait, the velocities are both in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c -0.6c) = -0.1c, but that's in the non-relativistic sense. But in relativity, that's not correct. So I should use the proper velocity addition formula.

The formula for the relative velocity u' (as seen from the frame moving at u) is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, I think that's when the other object is moving at v in the same frame. So in our case, the frame of astronaut A is moving at 0.6c. So in that frame, the speed of astronaut B (who is moving at 0.5c relative to the lab frame) would be (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

So numerator is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 -0.3 =0.7. So the relative speed u' is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But speed can't be negative, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's probably the right one.

Now for the total energy of the system. Both astronauts are moving, so I need to calculate their relativistic energies and sum them up. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c squared, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). 

Wait, but the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So astronaut A is 2m, moving at 0.6c. Astronaut B is 3m, moving at 0.5c.

So, calculate energy for each:

For A: v =0.6c. Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36)=1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. So energy E_A = gamma * m * c² * mass. Wait, mass is 2m. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, no. Gamma is for the object's rest frame. So the total energy is gamma * (rest mass) * c². So yes, for A: gamma is 1.25, rest mass is 2m, so E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For B: v=0.5c. Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approximately 1.1547. So E_B = gamma * 3m c². So 1.1547 *3m c². Let me compute that: 3 *1.1547 is about 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total is E_A + E_B = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². Rounding to two decimal places, that's 5.96 mc².

So looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is less. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should double-check the velocity calculation. Let me redo that:

u = 0.6c (A's speed in lab frame), and we're looking for the speed of B (0.5c) as seen from A's frame. 

Using u' = (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c^2).

v is the speed of B in lab frame: 0.5c.

u is the speed of A: 0.6c.

So u' = (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c² )

= (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)

= (-0.1c) / 0.7 = -0.142857c ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is 0.1428c, so yes, approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

So the energy part is correct as well, leading to option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed Calculation
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). To find the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of astronaut B in the lab frame) and \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of astronaut A in the lab frame). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the speed is \( 0.1428c \), which rounds to \( 0.14c \). Thus, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A:
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Speed: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2 \)

#### For astronaut B:
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Speed: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
